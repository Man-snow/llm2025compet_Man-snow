 **Summary**

The solution contains **1 Critical Error** and **1 Justification Gap**:

1. **Critical Error**: In Step 2 (Case 2), the argument assumes weights are integers (via \(w_y \geq 1\)), which is not stated in the problem. This invalidates the conclusion for non-integer weights.
2. **Justification Gap**: The conclusion claims maximality (\(2^{n-1} - 1\) is the largest possible) without proving that any larger family must contain a tight subcollection.

**Detailed Verification Log**

**Step 1: Pairwise Intersections**  
- **Correct**. All subsets in \(\mathcal{F}\) contain \(x\), so any two subsets intersect at \(x\). This satisfies the intersection condition for tight subcollections.

**Step 2: Union Weight Analysis**  
- **Case 1**: Correct. If \(w_x > \lfloor W/2 \rfloor\), the union’s weight exceeds \(\lfloor W/2 \rfloor\), violating the weight condition.  
- **Case 2**: **Critical Error**. The argument assumes \(w_y \geq 1\) for all \(y\), but the problem allows arbitrary positive weights (not necessarily integers). For example, if \(w_y = 0.5\) for some \(y \in U \setminus \{x\}\), the total weight \(w(U)\) could be \(w_x + 0.5\), which might still satisfy \(w(U) \leq \lfloor W/2 \rfloor\) if \(w_x\) is sufficiently small. The conclusion \(w(U) \geq \lfloor W/2 \rfloor + 1\) does not hold universally.  

**Step 3: Structural Constraints**  
- **Depends on Step 2**. The conclusion here inherits the critical error from Step 2. The claim that \(w(U) > \lfloor W/2 \rfloor\) is not justified for non-integer weights.

**Step 4: Cardinality of \(\mathcal{F}\)**  
- **Correct**. The family \(\mathcal{F}\) contains \(2^{n-1} - 1\) subsets (all subsets containing \(x\), excluding \(\emptyset\) and \(X\)).

**Conclusion**  
- **Justification Gap**. While \(\mathcal{F}\) is valid, the solution does not prove that no larger family exists. The claim that "any larger family would require including subsets not containing \(x\)" is unsubstantiated. There is no argument showing that such subsets necessarily form a tight subcollection, leaving maximality unproven.  

**Final Answer**  
- The final answer \(\boxed{2^{n-1} - 1}\) is invalidated due to unresolved errors in the proof.

 **Summary**  
The solution contains **critical errors** and **justification gaps**, rendering it incomplete and incorrect. Key issues include flawed reasoning in the weight analysis (incplicitly assuming \(w(z) \geq \lceil W/2 \rceil\)), failure to verify the "no element in exactly one set" condition for tightness, and a non-rigorous maximality argument. The final answer is not fully justified.

**Detailed Verification Log**

### Step 1: Pairwise Intersections  
**Correct.**  
All subsets in \(\mathcal{F}\) contain \(x\), so any two sets intersect at \(x\). This satisfies the "every two sets intersect" condition for tightness.

---

### Step 2: Union Weight Analysis  
**Critical Error** in Case 2.  
The argument claims \(w(z) \geq \lceil W/2 \rceil\) by asserting:  
\[
w(z) \geq W - \lfloor W/2 \rfloor - \sum_{y \notin U \cup \{z\}} w_y \geq W - \lfloor W/2 \rfloor.
\]  
This is invalid. The term \(\sum_{y \notin U \cup \{z\}} w_y\) is non-negative, so \(w(z) \geq W - \lfloor W/2 \rfloor - \text{(non-negative)}\) does **not** imply \(w(z) \geq W - \lfloor W/2 \rfloor\). For example, if \(W = 3\), \(\lfloor W/2 \rfloor = 1\), and \(\sum_{y \notin U \cup \{z\}} w_y = 1\), then \(w(z) \geq 3 - 1 - 1 = 1\), which is less than \(W - \lfloor W/2 \rfloor = 2\). The conclusion \(w(z) \geq \lceil W/2 \rceil\) is unproven.

**Critical Error** in handling the "no element in exactly one set" condition.  
The solution ignores this requirement entirely. Even if \(w(U) \leq \lfloor W/2 \rfloor\), the union \(U\) might contain elements appearing in only one subset of \(\mathcal{G}\), violating the tightness definition.

---

### Step 3: Maximality  
**Justification Gap.**  
The argument states that adding a subset not containing \(x\) could create a tight subcollection but does not rigorously prove this. Specifically:  
- It does not show how such a subcollection would satisfy **all** tightness conditions (e.g., proper union, pairwise intersections, weight constraint, and no element in exactly one set).  
- The reference to "extremal set theory" is vague and unsupported.  

---

### Conclusion  
The family \(\mathcal{F}\) is not proven to be maximal. The errors in Step 2 and gaps in Step 3 invalidate the claim that \(2^{n-1} - 1\) is the correct answer. The solution fails to meet the problem's strict requirements.

 **Summary**  
The solution contains **critical errors** in both parts and a **justification gap** in the maximality argument. The key issues are:  
1. **Part 1 (No Tight Subcollection):** The weight analysis in Step 2 incorrectly assumes the union's weight must exceed \(\lfloor W/2 \rfloor\), but examples exist where the weight condition is satisfied while structural constraints prevent tightness.  
2. **Part 2 (Maximality):**  
   - The Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem is misapplied (it typically applies to fixed-size subsets, not arbitrary sizes).  
   - The argument for larger families creating tight subcollections assumes adversarial weight assignments, which is invalid since weights are fixed.  

The final answer is **not justified** by the provided reasoning.  

---

**Detailed Verification Log**  

### **Part 1: No Tight Subcollection**  
- **Step 1 (Pairwise Intersections):** Correct. All sets in \(\mathcal{F}\) contain \(x\), so intersections are guaranteed.  
- **Step 2 (Weight Analysis):**  
  - **Critical Error:** The conclusion that \(w(U) > \lfloor W/2 \rfloor\) in all cases is flawed. For example, if \(W = 4\), \(w_x = 1\), and \(U = \{x, y\}\) with \(w(U) = 2 = \lfloor W/2 \rfloor\), the weight condition is satisfied. The structural requirement (elements in \(U \setminus \{x\}\) must appear in \(\geq 2\) sets) fails here, but the solution incorrectly attributes the contradiction to weight.  
  - The argument conflates weight and structural constraints. A subcollection might satisfy the weight condition but fail structural requirements, which the solution does not properly disentangle.  
- **Step 3 (Structural Requirements):**  
  - **Justification Gap:** While it correctly notes that elements in \(U \setminus \{x\}\) must appear in \(\geq 2\) sets, it does not rigorously show why this is impossible in \(\mathcal{F}\). For instance, if \(\mathcal{G}\) contains multiple sets with \(y \neq x\), this could theoretically satisfy the structural condition.  

### **Part 2: Maximality**  
- **Step 4 (Erdős–Ko–Rado Theorem):**  
  - **Critical Error:** The Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem applies to families of \(k\)-element subsets, not arbitrary-sized subsets. The family \(\mathcal{F}\) includes all non-empty proper subsets containing \(x\), which has size \(2^{n-1} - 1\), but the theorem does not directly justify maximality here.  
- **Step 5 (Larger Families):**  
  - **Critical Error:** The argument assumes weights can be adversarially assigned (e.g., setting \(w_x = \epsilon\)) to force a tight subcollection. However, the problem specifies weights are fixed and given. A valid maximality proof must hold for **any** weight assignment, not constructed ones.  
  - No justification is provided for why a larger family **necessarily** contains a tight subcollection under **all** weight configurations.  

### **Conclusion**  
The solution fails to rigorously prove that \(\mathcal{F}\) contains no tight subcollection or that it is maximal. The errors in weight analysis, misapplication of EKR, and reliance on adversarial weight assignments invalidate the argument. The final answer \(\boxed{2^{n-1} - 1}\) is unsubstantiated.

 **Summary**

The solution contains **critical errors** in both parts and **justification gaps** in Part 1. The key issues are:

1. **Part 1 (No Tight Subcollection):** The argument that the weight of the union \(U\) must exceed \(\lfloor W/2 \rfloor\) is not rigorously justified. The connection between the structural constraints (elements in \(U \setminus \{x\}\) requiring multiple appearances) and the weight limit is incomplete.
2. **Part 2 (Maximality):** The claim that adding a subset \(S \not\ni x\) creates a tight subcollection is incorrect. The constructed subcollection \(\mathcal{G} = \{S\} \cup \{T_1, \dots, T_{t-1}\}\) fails to satisfy tightness conditions, but this failure does not imply \(\mathcal{G}\) is tight. The argument misapplies the definition of a tight subcollection.

**Detailed Verification Log**

### **Part 1: No Tight Subcollection**
- **Step 1 (Pairwise Intersections):** Correct. All subsets in \(\mathcal{F}\) contain \(x\), ensuring pairwise intersections.
- **Step 2 (Union Weight and Structural Analysis):**
  - **Case 1 (\(w_x > \lfloor W/2 \rfloor\)):** Valid. The union’s weight exceeds \(\lfloor W/2 \rfloor\).
  - **Case 2 (\(w_x \leq \lfloor W/2 \rfloor\)):**  
    - **Justification Gap:** The claim that \(|\mathcal{G}| \geq 2m\) forces \(w(U)\) to exceed \(\lfloor W/2 \rfloor\) is unproven. The argument does not link the number of subsets (\(|\mathcal{G}| \geq 2m\)) to the total weight. For example, if elements in \(U \setminus \{x\}\) have negligible weights, \(w(U)\) could still satisfy the weight limit. The conclusion relies on an implicit assumption about weight distribution, which is not justified.
- **Step 3 (Contradiction via Structural Constraints):**  
  - **Critical Error:** The assertion that \(|\mathcal{G}| \geq 2m\) forces \(w(U)\) to exceed \(\lfloor W/2 \rfloor\) is false. No relationship between \(m\) and the weights \(w_i\) is established. The argument is incomplete and does not rule out configurations where \(w(U)\) remains within the limit.

### **Part 2: Maximality**
- **Step 4 (Combinatorial Maximality):**  
  - **Critical Error 1:** The claim that \(\mathcal{G} = \{S\} \cup \{T_1, \dots, T_{t-1}\}\) violates the pairwise intersection condition is incorrect. If \(S\) and \(T_i\) do not intersect, \(\mathcal{G}\) is **not** tight, as tightness requires all pairs to intersect. Thus, \(\mathcal{G}\) cannot be a tight subcollection.  
  - **Critical Error 2:** The argument that elements in \(S \setminus \{x\}\) appear in only one subset (violating the "no element in exactly one set" condition) is valid, but this means \(\mathcal{G}\) is **not** tight. The solution incorrectly concludes that \(\mathcal{G}\) is tight, whereas the violation of conditions actually prevents \(\mathcal{G}\) from being tight. Thus, adding \(S\) does not create a tight subcollection, invalidating the maximality proof.

### **Conclusion**
The solution fails to rigorously justify key steps in Part 1 and contains critical logical errors in Part 2. The proposed family \(\mathcal{F}\) is not proven to be maximal, and the argument against tight subcollections in \(\mathcal{F}\) has significant gaps.
