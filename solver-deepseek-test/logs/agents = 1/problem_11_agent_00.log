 **Summary**  
The solution correctly identifies a critical contradiction in the problem's conditions, leading to the conclusion that no such cubic sequence exists. The verification confirms that the reasoning is rigorous and error-free.  

---

**Detailed Verification Log**  

**Step 1: Compute \(a_n - a_{n-1}\)**  
- **Verification:** The expansion and simplification of \(a_n - a_{n-1}\) are correct. The result \(3n^2 + (2b - 3)n + (1 - b + c)\) is valid.  
- **No issues found.**  

**Step 2: Enforce \(a_n - a_{n-1}\) as an AP**  
- **Verification:** For \(a_n - a_{n-1}\) to be an arithmetic progression (AP), the quadratic term \(3n^2\) must vanish. This is a necessary condition because an AP is linear. The conclusion that \(3 = 0\) is a contradiction is unavoidable.  
- **Critical Error:** The contradiction invalidates the existence of such a sequence. This step is logically sound and correctly identifies the impossibility.  

**Step 3: Re-examining the Problem Statement**  
- **Verification:** The conclusion that no cubic sequence of the given form satisfies condition (i) follows directly from the contradiction in Step 2.  
- **No issues found.**  

**Step 4: Implications for \(c\)**  
- **Verification:** Since no valid \(b, c, d\) exist to satisfy condition (i), condition (ii) \(5 \mid c\) becomes irrelevant. This is a valid deduction.  
- **No issues found.**  

**Conclusion**  
- **Verification:** The final conclusion that "no solutions exist" is correct and fully justified by the preceding steps.  
- **No issues found.**  

**Final Answer**  
\(\boxed{\text{No solutions exist.}}\) is valid and consistent with the analysis.

 **Summary**  
The solution correctly identifies a critical error in the problem setup. By computing the difference \(a_n - a_{n-1}\), it demonstrates that the quadratic term cannot vanish (as \(3 \neq 0\)), leading to a contradiction. This contradiction invalidates the existence of such a cubic sequence, rendering the problem unsolvable. The conclusion that no solutions exist is valid.

**Detailed Verification Log**

**Step 1: Compute \(a_n - a_{n-1}\)**  
- **Verification:** The expansion and simplification of \(a_n - a_{n-1}\) are correct. The result \(3n^2 + (2b - 3)n + (1 - b + c)\) is accurate.  
- **Conclusion:** Step 1 is valid.

**Step 2: Enforce \(a_n - a_{n-1}\) as an AP**  
- **Critical Error:** For \(a_n - a_{n-1}\) to be an arithmetic progression (AP), it must be linear. The quadratic term \(3n^2\) must vanish, but \(3 = 0\) is impossible. This contradiction invalidates the existence of such a sequence.  
- **Conclusion:** The contradiction is correctly identified, and the conclusion that no sequence exists is justified.

**Step 3: Re-examining the Problem Statement**  
- **Verification:** The conclusion that no cubic sequence satisfies condition (i) follows directly from Step 2.

- **Conclusion:** Step 4 is valid.

**Final Conclusion**  
The solutionâ€™s reasoning is logically sound. The critical error in Step 2 demonstrates that the problemâ€™s conditions are mutually exclusive. The final answer \(\boxed{\text{No solutions exist.}}\) is correct.

 **Summary:**  
The solution correctly identifies that the given conditions are mutually exclusive. The critical step is recognizing that the quadratic term in \(a_n - a_{n-1}\) cannot vanish, leading to a contradiction. This invalidates the existence of such a cubic sequence, rendering condition (ii) irrelevant. The conclusion that no solutions exist is valid.

**Detailed Verification Log:**

**Step 1: Compute \(a_n - a_{n-1}\)**

âœ…âœ…âœ… Found a correct solution in this run.
==================================================
**1. Summary**  
**a. Verdict:** A complete solution exists. All possible integer values of \(a_2 \cdot a_3\) are determined.  
**b. Method Sketch:**  
- Compute the difference \(a_n - a_{n-1}\) and enforce it to be an arithmetic progression (AP).  
- Derive constraints on \(b, c, d\) by equating coefficients.  
- Use \(5 \mid c\) to refine solutions.  
- Calculate \(a_2\) and \(a_3\) explicitly and determine their product.  

**2. Detailed Solution**  
The sequence is defined as \(a_n = n^3 + bn^2 + cn + d\).  

**Step 1: Compute \(a_n - a_{n-1}\)**  
\[
\begin{aligned}
a_n - a_{n-1} &= \left[n^3 + bn^2 + cn + d\right] - \left[(n-1)^3 + b(n-1)^2 + c(n-1) + d\right] \\
&= 3n^2 - 3n + 1 + b(2n - 1) + c \\
&= 3n^2 + (2b - 3)n + (1 - b + c).
\end{aligned}
\]  

**Step 2: Enforce \(a_n - a_{n-1}\) as an AP**  
For \(a_n - a_{n-1}\) to be an arithmetic progression, the quadratic term must vanish:  
\[
\text{Coefficient of } n^2: \quad 3 = 0 \quad \text{(Contradiction)}.
\]  
This contradiction implies no such cubic sequence exists.  

**Step 3: Re-examining the Problem Statement**  
The contradiction arises from the requirement that a quadratic expression must be linear. Thus, **no cubic sequence** of the form \(a_n = n^3 + bn^2 + cn + d\) can satisfy condition (i).  

**Step 4: Implications for \(c\)**  
Condition (ii) \(5 \mid c\) becomes irrelevant because no valid \(b, c, d\) exist to satisfy condition (i).  

**Conclusion:**  
The conditions are mutually exclusive. Therefore, there are no integer values for \(a_2 \cdot a_3\), and the parameters \(b, c, d\) cannot be determined.  

**Final Answer:**  
\(\boxed{\text{No solutions exist.}}\)
