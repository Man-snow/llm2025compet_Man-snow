 **Summary**  
The solution correctly identifies the zero function as the only odd function satisfying the given equation for \( c \neq 0, 1 \). However, **Step 2 contains a critical error** in its reasoning, invalidating the conclusion. The remaining steps rely on this flawed logic, rendering the final answer unjustified.  

---

**Detailed Verification Log**  

**Step 1: Substitute \( x = 0 \)**  
- **Correct.**  
  Substituting \( x = 0 \) yields \( f(f(y)) = (c + 1)f(y) \), valid for all \( y \). This is a valid application of the functional equation.  

**Step 2: Substitute \( y = 0 \)**  
- **Critical Error.**  
  After substituting \( y = 0 \), the equation becomes \( f(x + f(0)) = c f(x) + f(0) \). Since \( f \) is odd, \( f(0) = 0 \), reducing the equation to \( f(x) = c f(x) \). The conclusion \( f(x) = 0 \) for all \( x \) (due to \( c \neq 1 \)) is **invalid** here.  
  - **Issue:** The equation \( f(x) = c f(x) \) is derived **only for inputs of the form** \( x + f(0) \), not for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \). Specifically, \( f(x + f(0)) = c f(x) + f(0) \) simplifies to \( f(x) = c f(x) \) **only when \( x + f(0) \) ranges over all real numbers**, which requires \( f(0) = 0 \). While \( f(0) = 0 \) is valid (from oddness), the conclusion \( f(x) = 0 \) for all \( x \) assumes the equation \( f(x) = c f(x) \) holds universally, which is not justified.  
  - **Consequence:** This step incorrectly eliminates potential non-trivial solutions.  

**Step 3: Verify the Zero Function**  
- **Correct but Irrelevant.**  
  The verification that \( f(x) = 0 \) satisfies the equation is valid. However, this does not address whether other solutions exist.  

**Step 4: Address Potential Gaps**  
- **Justification Gap.**  
  The argument assumes Step 2 has already forced \( f(x) = 0 \), but Step 2â€™s conclusion is flawed. The claim that "Step 2 eliminates non-trivial solutions" is circular and does not rigorously exclude non-zero functions. A valid proof would need to:  
  1. Use the recursive relation \( f(f(y)) = (c + 1)f(y) \) (from Step 1).  
  2. Exploit oddness and injectivity/surjectivity (if applicable) to analyze \( f \).  
  3. Derive a contradiction for non-zero \( f \), independent of Step 2â€™s faulty reasoning.  

**Conclusion**  
The critical error in Step 2 invalidates the solution. The claim that \( f(x) = 0 \) is the only solution remains unproven. A rigorous proof requires addressing the recursive relation \( f(f(y)) = (c + 1)f(y) \) and the oddness property without relying on the flawed logic in Step 2.

 **Summary**  
The solution correctly identifies that the only odd function satisfying the given equation for \( c \neq 0, 1 \) is \( f(x) = 0 \). All steps are rigorously justified, and no critical errors or justification gaps are present. The logic is valid, and the elimination of non-trivial solutions is thorough.

**Detailed Verification Log**

**Step 1: Oddness implies \( f(0) = 0 \)**  
- **Correct.**  
  By definition of an odd function, \( f(-x) = -f(x) \). Setting \( x = 0 \), we derive \( f(0) = -f(0) \), leading to \( f(0) = 0 \). This is a standard property of odd functions and is rigorously justified.

**Step 2: Substitute \( x = 0 \)**  
- **Correct.**  
  Substituting \( x = 0 \) into \( f(x + f(y)) = c f(x + y) + f(y) \) yields \( f(f(y)) = (c + 1)f(y) \). This is valid algebraic manipulation and correctly establishes \( f \circ f = (c + 1)f \).

**Step 3: Substitute \( y = 0 \)**  
- **Correct.**  
  Substituting \( y = 0 \) gives \( f(x) = c f(x) \). Since \( f(0) = 0 \), this simplifies to \( f(x)(1 - c) = 0 \). Given \( c \neq 1 \), this forces \( f(x) = 0 \) for all \( x \). The reasoning is complete and logically sound.

**Step 4: Verify the zero function**  
- **Correct.**  
  Substituting \( f(x) = 0 \) into the original equation confirms that both sides equal zero. This is a valid verification step.

**Step 5: Address potential gaps (non-trivial solutions)**  
- **Correct.**  
  Assuming \( f \neq 0 \), Step 2 implies \( f(f(y)) = (c + 1)f(y) \). If \( f(y) \neq 0 \), substituting \( f(z) = (c + 1)z \) into Step 3â€™s result \( f(z) = c f(z) \) leads to a contradiction for all \( c \neq 1 \). The cases \( c \neq -1 \) and \( c = -1 \) are both addressed, showing no non-trivial solutions exist. This is thorough and rigorous.

**Conclusion**  
All steps are justified without gaps or errors. The solution is complete and correct.

**Detailed Verification Log**

**Step 1: Oddness implies \( f(0) = 0 \).**  
- **Correct.**  
  The definition of an odd function \( f(-x) = -f(x) \) directly gives \( f(0) = -f(0) \), leading to \( f(0) = 0 \). This is a standard property of odd functions and is rigorously justified.

**Step 2: Substitute \( x = 0 \).**  
- **Correct.**  
  Substituting \( x = 0 \) into \( f(x + f(y)) = c f(x + y) + f(y) \) yields \( f(f(y)) = (c + 1)f(y) \). This is algebraically valid and establishes \( f \circ f = (c + 1)f \).

**Step 3: Substitute \( y = 0 \).**  
- **Correct.**  
  Substituting \( y = 0 \) gives \( f(x) = c f(x) \), which simplifies to \( f(x)(1 - c) = 0 \). Since \( c \neq 1 \), this forces \( f(x) = 0 \) for all \( x \). The logic is complete and valid.

**Step 4: Verify the zero function.**  
- **Correct.**  
  Substituting \( f(x) = 0 \) into the original equation confirms that both sides equal \( 0 \). This is a necessary verification and is correctly performed.

**Step 5: Address potential gaps (non-trivial solutions).**  
- **Correct.**  
  Assuming \( f \neq 0 \), Step 2 implies \( f(z) = (c + 1)z \) for \( z = f(y) \neq 0 \). Substituting into \( f(z) = c f(z) \) leads to \( (c + 1)z(1 - c) = 0 \). For \( c \neq 1 \), this requires \( c = -1 \) or \( z = 0 \). If \( c = -1 \), Step 3 forces \( f(z) = 0 \), contradicting \( z \neq 0 \). If \( c \neq -1 \), \( z = 0 \), also a contradiction. This eliminates non-trivial solutions. The argument is rigorous and closes all gaps.

**Conclusion:**  
All steps are logically sound, and the solution is complete. The zero function is the only solution.

The solution correctly identifies that the only odd function satisfying the given equation for \( c \neq 0, 1 \) is \( f(x) = 0 \).

**Detailed Verification Log**

**Step 1: Oddness implies \( f(0) = 0 \)**  
- **Correct.**  
  By definition, \( f(-x) = -f(x) \). Setting \( x = 0 \), we get \( f(0) = -f(0) \), which implies \( f(0) = 0 \). This is a standard property of odd functions and is rigorously justified.

**Step 2: Substitute \( x = 0 \)**

  Substituting \( x = 0 \) into the equation \( f(x + f(y)) = c f(x + y) + f(y) \) yields \( f(f(y)) = (c + 1)f(y) \). This is valid for all \( y \), establishing \( f \circ f = (c + 1)f \). No errors here.

**Step 3: Substitute \( y = 0 \)**  
- **Correct.**  
  Substituting \( y = 0 \) gives \( f(x + f(0)) = c f(x) + f(0) \). Since \( f(0) = 0 \), this simplifies to \( f(x) = c f(x) \). Rearranging gives \( f(x)(1 - c) = 0 \). Given \( c \neq 1 \), this forces \( f(x) = 0 \) for all \( x \). The logic is airtight.

**Step 4: Verify the zero function**  
- **Correct.**  
  Substituting \( f(x) = 0 \) into the original equation confirms that both sides equal \( 0 \). This is a valid verification step.

**Step 5: Address potential gaps**  
- **Redundant but Correct.**  
  The argument assumes a non-trivial solution \( f \neq 0 \) and uses Step 2 (\( f(f(y)) = (c + 1)f(y) \)) to derive a contradiction. For \( c \neq -1 \), it leads to \( z = 0 \), contradicting \( f(y) \neq 0 \). For \( c = -1 \), Step 3 still forces \( f(z) = 0 \). While this step is not strictly necessary (as Step 3 already resolves the problem), it does not contain errors.  

**Conclusion**  
All steps are logically sound and rigorously justified. The solution correctly concludes that \( f(x) = 0 \) is the only valid odd function for \( c \neq 0, 1 \).

âœ…âœ…âœ… Found a correct solution in this run.
==================================================
**1. Summary**  
- **a. Verdict:** The only solution is the zero function \( f(x) = 0 \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \).  
- **b. Method Sketch:**  
  1. Use the oddness of \( f \) to conclude \( f(0) = 0 \).  
  2. Substitute \( x = 0 \) to derive \( f(f(y)) = (c + 1)f(y) \).  
  3. Substitute \( y = 0 \) into the original equation to obtain \( f(x) = c f(x) \).  
  4. Since \( c \neq 1 \), this forces \( f(x) = 0 \).  
  5. Verify \( f \equiv 0 \) satisfies the equation for all \( c \neq 0, 1 \).  

**2. Detailed Solution**  

**Step 1: Oddness implies \( f(0) = 0 \).**  
For any odd function \( f \), by definition:  
\[
f(-x) = -f(x) \quad \forall x \in \mathbb{R}.
\]  
Setting \( x = 0 \), we get:  
\[
f(0) = -f(0) \implies 2f(0) = 0 \implies f(0) = 0.
\]  

**Step 2: Substitute \( x = 0 \) into the functional equation.**  
The original equation is \( f(x + f(y)) = c f(x + y) + f(y) \). Substituting \( x = 0 \):  
\[
f(f(y)) = c f(y) + f(y) = (c + 1)f(y) \quad \forall y \in \mathbb{R}.
\]  
This shows \( f \circ f = (c + 1)f \).  

**Step 3: Substitute \( y = 0 \) into the functional equation.**  
Substituting \( y = 0 \):  
\[
f(x + f(0)) = c f(x) + f(0).
\]  
From Step 1, \( f(0) = 0 \), so:  
\[
f(x) = c f(x) \quad \forall x \in \mathbb{R}.
\]  
Rearranging:  
\[
f(x)(1 - c) = 0 \quad \forall x \in \mathbb{R}.
\]  
Since \( c \neq 1 \), we conclude \( f(x) = 0 \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \).  

**Step 4: Verify the zero function.**  
Substitute \( f(x) = 0 \) into the original equation:  
\[
\text{LHS: } f(x + f(y)) = f(x + 0) = 0,
\]  
\[
\text{RHS: } c f(x + y) + f(y) = c \cdot 0 + 0 = 0.
\]  
Both sides are equal, confirming \( f(x) = 0 \) satisfies the equation.  

**Step 5: Address potential gaps.**  
- **Non-trivial solutions:** Suppose \( f \neq 0 \). From Step 2, \( f(f(y)) = (c + 1)f(y) \). If \( f(y) \neq 0 \) for some \( y \), then \( f(z) = (c + 1)z \) for \( z = f(y) \). However, Step 3 forces \( f(z) = c f(z) \), so substituting \( f(z) = (c + 1)z \):  
\[
(c + 1)z = c(c + 1)z \implies (c + 1)z(1 - c) = 0.
\]  
Since \( c \neq 1 \), this implies \( (c + 1)z = 0 \). If \( c \neq -1 \), then \( z = 0 \), contradicting \( f(y) \neq 0 \). If \( c = -1 \), Step 3 still requires \( f(z) = -f(z) \implies f(z) = 0 \), again contradicting \( f(y) \neq 0 \). Thus, no non-trivial solutions exist.  

**Conclusion:** The only odd function satisfying the equation for \( c \neq 0, 1 \) is \( f(x) = 0 \). The critical error claim in Step 2 is unfounded; the logic is valid because \( f(0) = 0 \) is rigorously derived from the oddness of \( f \), and the substitution \( y = 0 \) directly leads to \( f(x) = c f(x) \), which forces \( f \equiv 0 \) when \( c \neq 1 \).
