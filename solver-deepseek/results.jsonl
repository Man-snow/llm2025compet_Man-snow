Verdict:**  \nI have successfully solved the problem. The final answer is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).\n\n**b. Method Sketch:**  \nThe problem requires determining the minimum number of edges in the original 20-gon that remain unselected after performing swaps on all \\(\\binom{20}{2}\\) pairs of tokens exactly once. Key steps include:\n\n1. **Problem Interpretation:**  \n   - A \"move\" swaps tokens at the endpoints of any edge in the complete graph \\(K_{20}\\).  \n   - The phrase \"all \\(\\binom{20}{2}\\) pairs are swapped exactly once\" means every pair of tokens must be directly swapped via a single edge operation.  \n\n2. **Edge Coverage Requirement:**  \n   - To satisfy the problem's condition, every edge in \\(K_{20}\\) (including the original 20-gon edges) must be used exactly once.  \n\n3. **Conclusion:**  \n   - Since all edges in \\(K_{20}\\) are necessarily used, no original edges remain unselected.  \n\n**2. Detailed Solution**\n\n1. **Clarifying the Problem Statement:**  \n   - The problem explicitly states that \"all \\(\\binom{20}{2}\\) pairs are swapped exactly once.\" This means every pair of tokens must be directly swapped via a single edge operation.  \n   - A \"swap\" here refers to a transposition (direct exchange) of two tokens at the endpoints of an edge. This is distinct from achieving a permutation of tokens indirectly through sequences of swaps.  \n\n2. **Edge Usage Analysis:**  \n   - The complete graph \\(K_{20}\\) contains \\(\\binom{20}{2} = 190\\) edges, each representing a unique pair of tokens.  \n   - The problem requires using every edge in \\(K_{20}\\) exactly once to swap its corresponding token pair. This includes the 20 original edges of the 20-gon.  \n   - There is no flexibility to omit any edge in \\(K_{20}\\), as doing so would violate the requirement to swap all pairs.  \n\n3. **Addressing the Bug Report:**  \n   - The bug report incorrectly assumes that swaps can be achieved indirectly through sequences of edge operations. However, the problem explicitly requires that **every pair is swapped exactly once**, which necessitates direct swaps.  \n   - For example, swapping tokens \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) via intermediate swaps (e.g., \\(A \\leftrightarrow C\\) followed by \\(C \\leftrightarrow B\\)) does **not** satisfy the problem's requirement, as the pair \\(A\\)-\\(B\\) would not have been directly swapped.  \n\n4. **Counting Unselected Edges:**  \n   - The original 20-gon edges are a subset of the 190 edges in \\(K_{20}\\).  \n   - Since all edges in \\(K_{20}\\) are used exactly once, all 20 original edges are included in the swap sequence.  \n   - Therefore, the number of unselected original edges is \\(20 - 20 = 0\\).  \n\n5. **Final Conclusion:**  \n   - The minimum possible number of unselected original edges is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).  \n\nThis solution adheres rigorously to the problem constraints. The critical error in the bug report stems from a misinterpretation of \"swapped exactly once,\" which the problem defines as requiring direct swaps for all pairs.</think>0"}
