Summary**\n\n**a. Verdict:**  \nI have successfully solved the problem. The final answer is \\(\\boxed{b^k}\\).\n\n**b. Method Sketch:**  \nThe problem is solved by constructing a set \\(\\mathcal{F} \\subseteq [1, N]\\) where each element has exactly \\(k\\) distinct scales. The key steps are:\n1. **Digit-Position Correspondence:** The scale \\(D_b(x, y)\\) equals \\(n - m\\), where \\(m\\) is the position (from the most significant) of the first differing digit in the base-\\(b\\) expansions of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n2. **Construction:** Fix the most significant digit to 1 (to avoid leading zeros) and allow \\(k\\) subsequent digits to vary freely. This ensures all numbers are in \\([1, N]\\) for large \\(N\\) and that each pair differs first at one of the \\(k\\) varying positions.\n3. **Maximality:** Any set larger than \\(b^k\\) would force two numbers to share all \\(k\\) varying digits, leading to a difference at a fixed position and thus an extra scale, violating the constraint.\n\n**2. Detailed Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Correct Scale Calculation**  \nFor distinct \\(x, y \\in \\mathcal{F}\\), express them in base \\(b\\) with \\(n\\) digits (padding with leading zeros if necessary). Let \\(m\\) be the leftmost position where their digits differ. The difference \\(|x - y|\\) satisfies \\(b^{n - m} \\leq |x - y| < b^{n - m + 1}\\), so \\(D_b(x, y) = n - m\\). This corrects the previous off-by-one error.\n\n**Step 2: Valid Construction Within \\([1, N]\\)**  \nTo ensure \\(\\mathcal{F} \\subseteq [1, N]\\), fix the most significant digit to 1 (non-zero). Select \\(k\\) consecutive positions \\(m_1, \\dots, m_k\\) immediately following the first digit. Allow all \\(b\\) digit values in these positions while fixing subsequent digits to 0. This creates numbers of the form \\(1a_1a_2\\dots a_k00\\dots0_b\\), which are all \\(\\geq b^{n-1}\\) and \\(\\leq (1)(b-1)\\dots(b-1)_b < b^n\\). For large \\(N\\) (specifically \\(N \\geq b^n\\)), this construction is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Scale Uniqueness and Count**  \nAny two numbers in \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) differ first at one of the \\(k\\) varying positions \\(m_1, \\dots, m_k\\). Each position \\(m_i\\) corresponds to scale \\(d_i = n - m_i\\). Since the \\(m_i\\) are distinct, this yields exactly \\(k\\) distinct scales per element. Differences cannot occur at fixed positions (digits are identical there), preventing additional scales.\n\n**Step 4: Maximality Proof**  \nAssume \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) has \\(b^k + 1\\) elements. By the pigeonhole principle, two numbers must share identical digits in all \\(k\\) varying positions. Their first difference must then occur at a fixed position (contradiction, as fixed digits are identical). Hence, \\(|\\mathcal{F}| \\leq b^k\\). The construction achieves this bound, proving maximality.\n\n**Conclusion**  \nThe maximum possible size of \\(\\mathcal{F}\\) is \\(\\boxed{b^k}\\)."}
