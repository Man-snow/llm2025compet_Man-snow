Consider any non-crossing pairing of the vertices.  \n\n**Lemma 1 (Parity Constraint):**  \nAny non-crossing arc \\( \\overrightarrow{V_iV_j} \\) splits \\( P \\) into regions. The number of vertices between \\( V_i \\) and \\( V_j \\) (i.e., \\( j - i - 1 \\)) must be even.  \n*Proof:*  \nThe total number of vertices is \\( 2n \\). If an arc connects \\( V_i \\) and \\( V_j \\), the remaining \\( 2n - 2 \\) vertices must be partitioned into non-crossing pairs. This requires all regions formed by the arc to contain even numbers of vertices. Specifically, the region between \\( V_i \\) and \\( V_j \\) has \\( j - i - 1 \\) vertices, which must be even.  \n\n**Subcase 1: Adjacent pairs exist.**  \nSuppose \\( \\overrightarrow{V_iV_{i+1}} \\) is paired. The next arc must connect vertices in the remaining \\( 2n - 2 \\) vertices. By Lemma 1, the region after \\( V_{i+1} \\) must contain an even number of vertices. The smallest possible pairing is \\( \\overrightarrow{V_{i+2}V_{i+3}} \\). The four points \\( V_i, V_{i+1}, V_{i+2}, V_{i+3} \\) form a convex quadrilateral in clockwise order, violating condition 3.  \n\n**Subcase 2: No adjacent pairs.**  \nAll arcs span at least one vertex. Let \\( \\overrightarrow{V_iV_j} \\) be the outermost arc (maximizing clockwise distance). By Lemma 1, the region between \\( V_i \\) and \\( V_j \\) contains \\( k = j - i - 1 \\) vertices, where \\( k \\) is even.  \n\n- **If \\( k \\geq 2 \\):** Pairing the \\( k \\) vertices within \\( \\overrightarrow{V_iV_j} \\) requires nested arcs (e.g., \\( \\overrightarrow{V_{i+1}V_{i+2}} \\) nested inside \\( \\overrightarrow{V_iV_j} \\)), violating condition 2.  \n- **If \\( k = 0 \\):** Contradicts the \"no adjacent pairs\" assumption.  \n\n**General Contradiction:**  \n- Adjacent pairs force convex quadrilaterals (violating condition 3).  \n- Non-adjacent pairs either nest arcs (violating condition 2) or require regions with odd vertex counts (impossible by Lemma 1).  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo non-crossing pairing of a \\( 2n \\)-gon (\\( n \\geq 2 \\)) can satisfy all three conditions.
