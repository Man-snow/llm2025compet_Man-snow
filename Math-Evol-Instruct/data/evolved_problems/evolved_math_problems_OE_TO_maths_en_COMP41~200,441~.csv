- Fixed values: 20 distinct positive integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{20}$.
- Congruence condition: For each $k=1,2,\ldots,20$, $N \equiv a_k \pmod{k}$.
- Moves: Sergey queries a set $S \subseteq \{1,2,\ldots,20\}$, and receives the set $\{a_k : k \in S\}$ without indices.
- Objective: Number of moves for Sergey to guarantee determining $N$.
- Theme: Modular arithmetic reconstruction from incomplete information.

Step 2
#Plan#:
- Increase the number of fixed values from 20 to 30 to handle more variables.
- Reduce the upper bound of $N$ from 5000 to 500 to tighten the constraint and increase sensitivity to moduli.
- Add a query size restriction: Sergey can only ask for subsets of size at most 4 to limit information per move.
- Introduce non-consecutive moduli for complexity: Use $m_i = i + 4$ for $i=1$ to $30$ (i.e., moduli from 5 to 34) to avoid small moduli issues and ensure distinct residues.

3. Introduce aspect ratio constraint: require the rectangle to have aspect ratio between $1/r$ and $r$ for a given $r > 1$, adding a parameter that affects $\mu$.  
4. Ensure logical connections: Higher point density raises the threshold for isolation; no collinearity simplifies area calculations but tightens configurations; aspect ratio restricts rectangle shapes, deepening geometric dependency.

Consequently, if $k$ is odd we have $1=\\sum_{i=0}^{(k-1) / 2}\\left(t_{2 i+2}-t_{2 i}\\right)<\\lambda\\left(1+\\frac{k-1}{2}\\right)<1$; if $k$ is even, we have $1<1+t_{k}-t_{k-1}=$ $\\sum_{i=0}^{k / 2-1}\\left(t_{2 i+2}-t_{2 i}\\right)+\\left(t_{k+1}-t_{k-1}\\right)<\\lambda\\left(1+\\frac{k}{2}\\right)<1$. A contradiction in either case.\n\n\n\nProof of Lemma 2. Let $I_{0}$, respectively $I_{1}$, be the set of all indices $i$ in the range $2, \\ldots, k-1$ such that $m_{i}$ is even, respectively odd. Clearly, $I_{0}$ and $I_{1}$ form a partition of that range. Since $m_{i} \\geq 2$ if $i$ is in $I_{0}$, and $m_{i} \\geq 1$ if $i$ is in $I_{1}$ (recall that the $m_{i}$ are positive integers),\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}=\\sum_{i \\in I_{0}} m_{i}+\\sum_{i \\in I_{1}} m_{i} \\geq 2\\left|I_{0}\\right|+\\left|I_{1}\\right|=2(k-2)-\\left|I_{1}\\right|, \\quad \\text { or } \\quad\\left|I_{1}\\right| \\geq 2(k-2)-\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}\n\n$$\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\n\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{1}}{2}\\right\\rfloor+\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{i}}{2}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{k}}{2}\\right\\rfloor & \\leq m_{1}+\\left(\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} \\frac{m_{i}}{2}-\\frac{\\left|I_{1}\\right|}{2}\\right)+m_{k} \\\\\n\n& \\leq m_{1}+\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}-(k-2)+\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}\\right)+m_{k} \\\\\n\n& =\\sum_{i=1}^{k} m_{i}-k+2 .\n\n\\end{aligned}\n\n$$']"

1.  **Polynomial:** Monic, integer coefficients, fixed maximum degree `n`.
2.  **Degree Constraint:** Degree must be at most `n`.
3.  **Bound `k`:** Positive integer `k` ≤ `n`. Fixed for the problem.
4.  **Points:** Requirement for `k+1` distinct integer points `x1, ..., xk+1`.
5.  **Condition:** The sum equality `∑ᵢ=1..k P(xi) = P(xk+1)` must hold.
6.  **Quantifier:** ""For every monic polynomial..."".
7.  **Objective:** Find all positive integers `n` satisfying the condition.

**Theme:** Ensuring a specific linear dependence among polynomial evaluations exists for all polynomials of a certain type up to a given degree.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Expand the Polynomial Set:** Instead of applying the condition to every single monic polynomial, require it to hold for every possible *pair* `(P, F)` where `P` is as before (monic, deg≤`n`, int coeffs) and `F` is a new distinct monic polynomial (deg≤`m`, int coeffs) with `m` being another variable related to `n`. This adds a layer of complexity by introducing dependencies between different polynomials.
2.  **Modify the Condition:** Replace the simple sum equality with a congruence modulo an expression involving `F`. Specifically require `∑ᵢ=₁ᵏ P(x_i) ≡ P(x_{k+1}) mod F(a_j)` for each index `j` of the points `a_j`. This introduces multiple simultaneous modular constraints tied to the new polynomial `F` and the evaluation points themselves.
3.  **Constraints on Points:** Require the `k+1` distinct integers to be `s` consecutive integers, where `s` is another variable depending on `n`, `F`, or `k`. This adds a specific structural constraint (consecutiveness) linking the points and potentially the degree/polynomials.
4.  **Modify the Bound `k`:** Instead of `k` being simply ≤ `n`, define `k` as a function of properties of `F` and `n`, like `k = |F(m) - F(0)| + b` (where `b` is a constant), making its value polynomial-dependent and more complex.
5.  **Maintain Theme:** Ensure the core theme remains: finding `n` such that the (now significantly more complex) condition holds for all relevant polynomials `P` *in conjunction with* each relevant `F`, using points constrained by the properties of `F`.

**#Elements Identified#**:  
- **Variables**: \(n > 1\) (integer), \(X\) (\(n\)-element set), \(k\) (number of subsets in a subcollection), and the collection of subsets \(A_1, \dots, A_k\).  
- **Constraints**:  
  - Subsets are distinct, proper (\(A_i \neq X\)), and non-empty.  
  - ""Tight"" defined by:  
    - \(\bigcup A_i \subsetneq X\) (proper union),  
    - No element of \(X\) lies in exactly one \(A_i\).  
  - Goal: Maximize the size of a collection with **no non-empty tight subcollection** (including the whole collection).  
- **Theme**: Extremal set theory with combinatorial constraints.  

### Step 2  
**#Plan#**:  
1. **Introduce real-world constraints and dependencies**:  
   - Assign weights to elements of \(X\), summing to \(W\), and require the weightsum of a tight subcollection's union to be at most \(\lfloor W/2 \rfloor\). This adds computational complexity.  
2. **Concretize and amplify conditions**:  
   - Replace ""no non-empty subcollection"" with ""no subcollection of size \(t\)"" (where \(t \geq 2\) is a new parameter). This scales complexity and links to Ramsey theory.  
   - Enforce pairwise intersections: Require every two subsets in a ""tight"" subcollection to intersect, adding dependency analysis.  
3. **Ensure logical coherence**:  
   - Maintain all original constraints (proper subsets, distinctness) while integrating new variables (\(w_i\), \(t\), \(W\)) with unambiguous definitions.

To show that no subcollection of the $B_{k}$ is tight, consider a subcollection $\\mathcal{C}$ whose union $U$ is a proper subset of $X$, let $m$ be an element in $X \\backslash U$, and notice that $\\mathcal{C}$ is a subcollection of $\\left\\{B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{m-1}, B_{m+n-1}, \\ldots, B_{2 n-2}\\right\\}$, since the other $B$ 's are precisely those containing $m$.

Since no subcollection of $\\mathcal{B}$ is tight, $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ is not tight, and since the union of $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ does not contain $x$, some $x^{\\prime}$ in $X$ is covered by a single member of $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$. In other words, there is a single set in $\\mathcal{B}$ covering $x^{\\prime}$ but not $x$. In this case, draw an arrow from $x$ to $x^{\\prime}$.

 'Proceed again by induction on $n$ to show that the cardinality of a collection of proper non-empty subsets of $X$, no subcollection of which is tight, does not exceed $2 n-2$.\n\n\n\nConsider any collection $\\mathcal{B}$ of proper non-empty subsets of $X$ with no tight subcollection (we call such collection good). Assume that there exist $M, N \\in \\mathcal{B}$ such that $M \\cup N$ is distinct from $M, N$, and $X$. In this case, we will show how to modify $\\mathcal{B}$ so that it remains good, contains the same number of sets, but the total number of elements in the sets of $\\mathcal{B}$ increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider a maximal (relative to set-theoretic inclusion) subcollection $\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\mathcal{B}$ such that the set $C=\\bigcup_{A \\in \\mathcal{C}} A$ is distinct from $X$ and from all members of $\\mathcal{C}$. Notice here that the union of any subcollection $\\mathcal{D} \\subset \\mathcal{B}$ cannot coincide with any $K \\in \\mathcal{B} \\backslash \\mathcal{D}$, otherwise $\\{K\\} \\cup \\mathcal{D}$ would be tight. Surely, $\\mathcal{C}$ exists (since $\\{M, N\\}$ is an example of a collection satisfying the requirements on $\\mathcal{C}$, except for maximality); moreover, $C \\notin \\mathcal{B}$ by the above remark.\n\n\n\nSince $C \\neq X$, there exists an $L \\in \\mathcal{C}$ and $x \\in L$ such that $L$ is the unique set in $\\mathcal{C}$ containing $x$. Now replace in $\\mathcal{B}$ the set $L$ by $C$ in order to obtain a new collection $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ (then $\\left|\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}\\right|=|\\mathcal{B}|$ ). We claim that $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ is good.\n\n\n\nAssume, to the contrary, that $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ contained a tight subcollection $\\mathcal{T}$; clearly, $C \\in \\mathcal{T}$, otherwise $\\mathcal{B}$ is not good. If $\\mathcal{T} \\subseteq \\mathcal{C} \\cup\\{C\\}$, then $C$ is the unique set in $\\mathcal{T}$ containing $x$ which is impossible. Therefore, there exists $P \\in \\mathcal{T} \\backslash(\\mathcal{C} \\cup\\{C\\})$. By maximality of $\\mathcal{C}$, the collection $\\mathcal{C} \\cup\\{P\\}$ does not satisfy the requirements imposed on $\\mathcal{C}$; since $P \\cup C \\neq X$, this may happen only if $C \\cup P=P$, i.e., if $C \\subset P$. But then $\\mathcal{G}=(\\mathcal{T} \\backslash\\{C\\}) \\cup \\mathcal{C}$ is a tight subcollection in $\\mathcal{B}$ : all elements of $C$ are covered by $\\mathcal{G}$ at least twice (by $P$ and an element of $\\mathcal{C}$ ), and all the rest elements are covered by $\\mathcal{G}$ the same number of times as by $\\mathcal{T}$. A contradiction. Thus $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ is good.\n\n\n\nSuch modifications may be performed finitely many times, since the total number of elements of sets in $\\mathcal{B}$ increases. Thus, at some moment we arrive at a good collection $\\mathcal{B}$ for which the procedure no longer applies. This means that for every $M, N \\in \\mathcal{B}$, either $M \\cup N=X$ or one of them is contained in the other.\n\n\n\nNow let $M$ be a minimal (with respect to inclusion) set in $\\mathcal{B}$. Then each set in $\\mathcal{B}$ either contains $M$ or forms $X$ in union with $M$ (i.e., contains $X \\backslash M$ ). Now one may easily see that the two collections\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\mathcal{B}_{+}=\\{A \\backslash M: A \\in \\mathcal{B}, M \\subset A, A \\neq M\\}, \\quad \\mathcal{B}_{-}=\\{A \\cap M: A \\in \\mathcal{B}, X \\backslash M \\subset A, A \\neq X \\backslash M\\}\n\n$$\n\n\n\nare good as collections of subsets of $X \\backslash M$ and $M$, respectively; thus, by the induction hypothesis, we have $\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{+}\\right|+\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{-}\\right| \\leq 2 n-4$.\n\n\n\nFinally, each set $A \\in \\mathcal{B}$ either produces a set in one of the two new collections, or coincides with $M$ or $X \\backslash M$. Thus $|\\mathcal{B}| \\leq\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{+}\\right|+\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{-}\\right|+2 \\leq 2 n-2$, as required.'
 'We provide yet another proof of the estimate $|\\mathcal{B}| \\leq 2 n-2$. Consider any collection $\\mathcal{B}$ of proper non-empty subsets of $X$ with no tight subcollection (we call such collection good). Arguing indirectly, we assume that there exists a good collection $\\mathcal{B}$ with $|\\mathcal{B}| \\geq 2 n-1$, and choose one such for the minimal possible value of $n$. Clearly, $n>2$.\n\n\n\nFirstly, we perform a different modification of $\\mathcal{B}$. Choose any $x \\in X$, and consider the subcollection $\\mathcal{B}_{x}=\\{B: B \\in \\mathcal{B}, x \\notin B\\}$. By our assumption, $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ is not tight. As the union of sets in $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ is distinct from $X$, either this collection is empty, or there exists an element $y \\in X$ contained in a unique member $A_{x}$ of $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$. In the former case, we add the set $B_{x}=X \\backslash\\{x\\}$ to $\\mathcal{B}$, and in the latter we replace $A_{x}$ by $B_{x}$, to form a new collection $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$. (Notice that if $B_{x} \\in \\mathcal{B}$, then $B_{x} \\in \\mathcal{B}_{x}$ and $y \\in B_{x}$, so $B_{x}=A_{x}$.)\n\n\n\nWe claim that the collection $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ is also good. Indeed, if $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ has a tight subcollection $\\mathcal{T}$, then $B_{x}$ should lie in $\\mathcal{T}$. Then, as the union of the sets in $\\mathcal{T}$ is distinct from $X$, we should have $\\mathcal{T} \\subseteq \\mathcal{B}_{x} \\cup\\left\\{B_{x}\\right\\}$. But in this case an element $y$ is contained in a unique member of $\\mathcal{T}$, namely $B_{x}$, so $\\mathcal{T}$ is not tight - a contradiction.\n\n\n\nPerform this procedure for every $x \\in X$, to get a good collection $\\mathcal{B}$ containing the sets $B_{x}=X \\backslash\\{x\\}$ for all $x \\in X$. Consider now an element $x \\in X$ such that $\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{x}\\right|$ is maximal. As we have mentioned before, there exists an element $y \\in X$ belonging to a unique member (namely, $B_{x}$ ) of $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$. Thus, $\\mathcal{B}_{x} \\backslash\\left\\{B_{x}\\right\\} \\subset \\mathcal{B}_{y}$; also, $B_{y} \\in \\mathcal{B}_{y} \\backslash \\mathcal{B}_{x}$. Thus we get $\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{y}\\right| \\geq\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{x}\\right|$, which by the maximality assumption yields the equality, which in turn means that $\\mathcal{B}_{y}=\\left(\\mathcal{B}_{x} \\backslash\\left\\{B_{x}\\right\\}\\right) \\cup\\left\\{B_{y}\\right\\}$.\n\n\n\nTherefore, each set in $\\mathcal{B} \\backslash\\left\\{B_{x}, B_{y}\\right\\}$ contains either both $x$ and $y$, or none of them. Collapsing $\\{x, y\\}$ to singleton $x^{*}$, we get a new collection of $|\\mathcal{B}|-2$ subsets of $(X \\backslash\\{x, y\\}) \\cup\\left\\{x^{*}\\right\\}$ containing no tight subcollection. This contradicts minimality of $n$.']"

We will animate the points $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ linearly in a variable $t$; then $g(t)=f\\left(A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}\\right)$ will have degree at most $\\operatorname{deg} f$ (assuming it is not zero). The claim above then establishes that any root of $g$ must be a multiple root, so if we can show that there are at least $n$ roots, we will have shown $\\operatorname{deg} g \\geq 2 n$, and so $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$.\n\n\n\nGeometrically, our goal is to exhibit $2 n$ linearly moving points so that they form a regular $2 n$-gon a total of $n$ times, but not always form one.\n\n\n\nWe will do this as follows. Draw $n$ mirrors through the origin, as lines making angles of $\\frac{\\pi}{n}$ with each other. Then, any point $P$ has a total of $2 n$ reflections in the mirrors, as shown below for $n=5$. (Some of these reflections may overlap.)\n\n\n\nDraw the $n$ angle bisectors of adjacent mirrors. Observe that the reflections of $P$ form a regular $2 n$ gon if and only if $P$ lies on one of the bisectors.\n\n\n\nWe will animate $P$ on any line $\\ell$ which intersects all $n$ bisectors (but does not pass through the origin), and let $P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{2 n}$ be its reflections. Clearly, these are also all linearly animated, and because of the reasons above, they will form a regular $2 n$-gon exactly $n$ times, when $\\ell$ meets each bisector. So this establishes $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$ for the reasons described previously.\n\n\n\nNow we pass to constructing a polynomial $f$ of degree $2 n$ having the desired property. First of all, we will instead find a polynomial $g$ which has this property, but only when points with sum zero are input. This still solves the problem, because then we can choose\n\n\n\n$$\nf\\left(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}\\right)=g\\left(A_{1}-\\bar{A}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}-\\bar{A}\\right)\n$$\n\n\n\nwhere $\\bar{A}$ is the centroid of $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$. This has the upshot that we can now always assume $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$, which will simplify the ensuing discussion.\n\n\n\n<img_3624>\n\n\n\nWe will now construct a suitable $g$ as a sum of squares. This means that, if we write $g=g_{1}^{2}+g_{2}^{2}+$ $\\cdots+g_{m}^{2}$, then $g=0$ if and only if $g_{1}=\\cdots=g_{m}=0$, and that if their degrees are $d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{m}$, then $g$ has degree at most $2 \\max \\left(d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{m}\\right)$.\n\n\n\nThus, it is sufficient to exhibit several polynomials, all of degree at most $n$, such that $2 n$ points with zero sum are the vertices of a regular $2 n$-gon if and only if the polynomials are all zero at those points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we will impose the constraints that all $\\left|A_{i}\\right|^{2}=x_{i}^{2}+y_{i}^{2}$ are equal. This uses multiple degree 2 constraints.\n\n\n\nNow, we may assume that the points $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ all lie on a circle with centre 0 , and $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$. If this circle has radius 0 , then all $A_{i}$ coincide, and we may ignore this case.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, the circle has positive radius. We will use the following lemma.\n\n\n\nLemma. Suppose that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are complex numbers of the same non-zero magnitude, and suppose that $a_{1}^{k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{k}=0, k=1, \\ldots, n$. Then $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ form a regular $2 n$-gon centred at the origin. (Conversely, this is easily seen to be sufficient.)\n\n\n\nProof. Since all the hypotheses are homogenous, we may assume (mostly for convenience) that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ lie on the unit circle. By Newton's sums, the $k$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are all zero for $k$ in the range $1, \\ldots, n$.\n\n\n\nTaking conjugates yields $a_{1}^{-k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{-k}=0$, $k=1, \\ldots, n$. Thus, we can repeat the above logic to obtain that the $k$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}^{-1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}^{-1}$ are also all zero for $k=1, \\ldots, n$. However, these are simply the $(2 n-k)$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ (divided by $a_{1} \\cdots a_{2 n}$ ), so the first $2 n-1$ symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are all zero. This implies that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ form a regular $2 n$-gon centred at the origin.\n\n\n\nWe will encode all of these constraints into our polynomial. More explicitly, write $a_{r}=x_{r}+y_{r} i$; then the constraint $a_{1}^{k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{k}=0$ can be expressed as $p_{k}+q_{k} i=0$, where $p_{k}$ and $q_{k}$ are real polynomials in the coordinates. To incorporate this, simply impose the constraints $p_{k}=0$ and $q_{k}=0$; these are conditions of degree $k \\leq n$, so their squares are all of degree at most $2 n$.\n\n\n\nTo recap, taking the sum of squares of all of these constraints gives a polynomial $f$ of degree at most $2 n$ which works whenever $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$. Finally, the centroid-shifting trick gives a polynomial which works in general, as wanted.""]"

#Elements Identified#:
- **n**: a positive integer.
- **Points**: fixed, distinct on a circle; total \(2n\) points.
- **Action**: split into \(n\) pairs; each pair joined by an oriented arrow.
- **Conditions (good configuration)**:
  1. **Non-crossing**: no two arrows cross.
  2. **Forbidden convex quadrangle**: no arrows \(\overrightarrow{AB}\) and \(\overrightarrow{CD}\) such that \(A, B, C, D\) form a convex quadrangle oriented clockwise.
- **Goal**: count the number of good configurations.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. **Modify the geometric setting**: Change the circle to the vertices of a starlike convex polygon. This increases complexity by introducing variable angular separations and irregularities in point placement, which complicates non-crossing checks and convexity assessments.
2. **Add an orientation constraint for arrows**: Require that all arrows must point in a clockwise orientation around the polygon. This adds a global directional constraint that interacts with convex quadrangles and adjacent point positions.
3. **Introduce a non-nesting condition**: Forbid nested arrows (i.e., no arrow \(\overrightarrow{AB}\) and \(\overrightarrow{CD}\) where \(C\) and \(D\) lie entirely between \(A\) and \(B\) on the shorter arc between them). This adds local geometric constraints and intertwines with the non-crossing condition.
4. **Ensure logical coherence**: The changes should maintain core concepts while adding complexity.

Let $\\ell$, respectively $r$, be the left, respectively right, cell of $D$ and notice that the cell below $\\ell$, respectively $r$, is the right, respectively left, cell of a domino $D_{1}$, respectively $D_{2}$, in the arrangement.\n\n\n\nIf $\\ell$ is covered by a domino $D_{\\ell}$ in the arrangement, since $D$ is bad and no two dominoes in the arrangement form a square, it follows that $D_{\\ell}$ is vertical. If $r$ were also covered by a domino $D_{r}$ in the arrangement, then $D_{r}$ would also be vertical, and would therefore form a square with $D_{\\ell}-$ a contradiction. Hence $r$ is not covered, and there is room for $D_{\\ell}$ to be placed so as to cover $D$, to obtain a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes. The case where $r$ is covered is dealt with similarly.\n\n\n\nFinally, if neither cell of $D$ is covered, addition of an extra domino to cover $D$ and, if necessary, removal of the domino above $D$ to avoid formation of a square, yields a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has at least as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes. (Figure 5 illustrates the two cases.)'
 ""We present an alternative proof of the bound.\n\n\n\nLabel the rows upwards $0,1, \\ldots, m-1$, and the columns from the left to the right by $0,1, \\ldots, 2 n-1$; label each cell by the pair of its column's and row's numbers, so that $(1,0)$ is the second left cell in the bottom row. Colour the cells chess-like so that $(0,0)$ is white. For $0 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, we say that the $i$ th white diagonal is the set of cells of the form $(2 i+k, k)$, where $k$ ranges over all appropriate indices. Similarly, the ith black diagonal is the set of cells of the form $(2 i+1-k, k)$. (Notice that the white cells in the upper-left corner and the black cells in the upper-right corner are not covered by these diagonals.)\n\n\n\nClaim. Assume that $K$ lowest cells of some white diagonal are all covered by dominoes. Then all these $K$ dominoes face right or up from the diagonal. (In other words, the black cell of any such\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndomino is to the right or to the top of its white cell.) Similarly, if $K$ lowest cells of some black diagonal are covered by dominoes, then all these dominoes face left or up from the diagonal.\n\n\n\nProof. By symmetry, it suffices to prove the first statement. Assume that $K$ lowest cells of the $i$ th white diagonal is completely covered. We prove by induction on $k<K$ that the required claim holds for the domino covering $(2 i+k, k)$. The base case $k=0$ holds due to the problem condition. To establish the step, one observes that if $(2 i+k, k)$ is covered by a domino facing up of right, while $(2 i+k+1, k+1)$ is covered by a domino facing down or left, then these two dominoes form a square.\n\n\n\nWe turn to the solution. We will prove that there are at least $d=\\lfloor m / 2\\rfloor$ empty white cells. Since each domino covers exactly one white cell, the required bound follows.\n\n\n\nIf each of the first $d$ white diagonals contains an empty cell, the result is clear. Otherwise, let $i<d$ be the least index of a completely covered white diagonal. We say that the dominoes covering our diagonal are distinguished. After removing the distinguished dominoes, the board splits into two parts; the left part $L$ contains $i$ empty white cells on the previous diagonals. So, it suffices to prove that the right part $R$ contains at least $d-i$ empty white cells.\n\n\n\nLet $j$ be the number of distinguished dominoes facing up. Then at least $j-i$ of these dominoes cover some cells of (distinct) black diagonals (the relation $m \\leq n$ is used). Each such domino faces down from the corresponding black diagonal - so, by the Claim, each such black diagonal contains an empty cell in $R$. Thus, $R$ contains at least $j-i$ empty black cells.\n\n\n\nNow, let $w$ be the number of white cells in $R$. Then the number of black cells in $R$ is $w-d+j$, and at least $i-j$ of those are empty. Thus, the number of dominoes in $R$ is at most $(w-d+j)-(j-i)=w-(d-i)$, so $R$ contains at least $d-i$ empty white cells, as we wanted to show.""]"

*   **Solution Path:** Requires applying the undefined condition from part (a) to find restrictions on \(b, c, d\), then computing the product.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Explicit Constraint:** Replace the implicit reference ""the condition in part (a)"" with a specific, moderately complex condition. Define that the sequence *after translation* (\(a_n - a_{n-1}\) for \(n \geq 1\)) forms an arithmetic progression. However, explicitly require the cubic relation to hold for *all* integers \(n\).
2.  **Parameter Constraint:** Introduce a divisibility/multiplicity constraint on the linear coefficient \(c\). Specify that \(c\) must be divisible by a specific prime number (e.g., 5) and require finding possible values modulo that prime.
3.  **Result Complexity:** Instead of directly computing \(a_{2015} \cdot a_{2016}\) after finding parameters, require determining the *possible values* of the product *based* on the allowed combinations of \(b, c, d\) under the new constraints, implying solving a system first.
4.  **Scale Down:** Replace large indices 2015, 2016 with smaller, consecutive indices like \(a_2 \cdot a_3\) to reduce unnecessary large calculations without losing mathematical essence or the concept of consecutive terms.
5.  **Ensure Coherence:** All additions are interdependent. The sequence definition and domain are fixed. The explicit translation condition constrains all parameters. The prime constraint on \(c\) adds a layer of modular arithmetic. Solving for possible products based on parameter constraints derived from both explicit conditions requires deeper logical inference.

We will show that $p=0$ or $q=0$. Consider the line $y=(q-p) x+p$ passing through $(0, p)$ and $(1, q)$; the latter are two points the line under consideration and the cubic $y^{2}=x^{3}+b x^{2}+c x+d$ share.

Then there is a small triangle in each pair. Without loss of generality, assume that triangles $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ and $D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}$ are small.

This contradicts the Lemma, applied for triangle $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ inside $L K B$.\n\nCase 2. Ray $C_{1} D_{1}$ does not intersect $A B$. Then choose a ""sufficiently far"" point $K$ on ray $B A$ such that $\\left[K A_{1} C_{1}\\right]>\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]$, and that ray $K C_{1}$ intersects line $B C$ at some point $L$ (see Figure 5). Since ray $C_{1} D_{1}$ does not intersect line $A B$, the points $A$ and $D_{1}$ are on different sides of $K L$; then $A$ and $D$ are also on different sides, and $C$ is on the same side as $A$ and $B$.

- **Function properties**: The function \(f\) is surjective and maps \(\mathbb{N}\) to \(\mathbb{N}\).  
- **Variables**: \(m\) and \(n\) (elements of \(\mathbb{N}\)), and prime \(p\).  
- **Conditions**: For all \(m, n \in \mathbb{N}\) and all primes \(p\), divisibility by \(p\) holds: \(p \mid f(m+n)\) if and only if \(p \mid (f(m) + f(n))\).  
- **Theme**: The problem involves functional equations with a divisibility equivalence condition tied to prime numbers.  

#### Step 2  
**#Plan#**:  
1. **Change function property constraint**: Replace ""surjective"" with ""bijective"" to add injectivity as an additional requirement, reducing the solution space and increasing analytical depth.  
2. **Expand the number of variables**: Introduce a third variable \(k \in \mathbb{N}\) to extend the condition to sums of three elements, requiring that for every \(m, n, k \in \mathbb{N}\) and every prime \(p\), the divisibility equivalence must hold for \(f(m+n+k)\) and the sum \(f(m) + f(n) + f(k)\). This adds complexity by forcing consistency across more variables and relations.  
3. **Modify divisibility equivalence**: Instead of merely requiring equivalence modulo \(p\), strengthen it to require equivalence modulo \(p^2\). Specifically, for all \(m, n \in \mathbb{N}\) and all primes \(p\), \(f(m+n) \equiv f(m) + f(n) \pmod{p^2}\). This introduces higher-order divisibility constraints, making the condition stricter.  
- **Ensure coherence**: All modifications are logically interconnected. Bijectivity ensures the function is fully invertible, complementing the extended condition with three variables. The modulo \(p^2\) condition for two variables refines and tightens the original divisibility equivalence, providing a layered challenge.

We have $p \\mid f(x+(2 x d-x))=f(2 x d)$; moreover, since $d \\mid 2 x d+(y-x)=y+(2 x d-x)$, we get $p \\mid f(y+(2 x d-x))$. Then by the problem condition $p|f(x)+f(2 x d-x), p| f(y)+f(2 x d-x)$, and hence $f(x) \\equiv-f(2 x d-x) \\equiv f(y)$ $(\\bmod p)$.\n\nOn the other hand, assume that $f(x) \\equiv f(y)(\\bmod p)$. Again we have $p \\mid f(x)+f(2 x d-x)$ which by our assumption implies that $p \\mid f(x)+f(2 x d-x)+(f(y)-f(x))=f(y)+f(2 x d-x)$. Hence by the problem condition $p \\mid f(y+(2 x d-x))$.

If $n=1$ then, by the Lemma, $p \\nmid f(1)$ for any prime $p$, so $f(1)=1$, and the base is established. Suppose that $n>1$ and denote $k=f(n)$.

- **Conditions**: Meeting rules (opposite-direction ants turn 90° clockwise, perpendicular or >2 ants don't turn), movement speed constant at 1, ants fall off at edges.  
- **Participants**: Multiple ants placed at midpoints.  
- **Actions**: Movement initiation at time 0, directional changes upon specific collisions, falling off edges.  
- **Processes**: Ant interactions drive directional changes, affecting when they exit the grid.  
- **Theme**: Deterministic movement dynamics on a grid seeking worst-case exit time.  
- **Manipulation Targets**: Grid dimensionality (e.g., rectangular), direction rules (e.g., non-clockwise turns), ant heterogeneity (e.g., variable properties), environmental constraints (e.g., obstacles), or behavior dependencies (e.g., turn delays).  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
- **Modify Grid Dimensionality**: Change from square (m × m) to rectangular (m × n), introducing asymmetry and two variables, complicating edge distances and meeting probabilities.  
- **Add Turn Variability**: Replace fixed 90° clockwise turn with a counterclockwise turn if a newly introduced ""turn resistance"" factor r (for each ant, 0 ≤ r ≤ 1) exceeds 0.5, requiring tracking per-ant state; this links to initial positions.  
- **Introduce Obstacles**: Place immovable obstacles at unit squares, blocking paths; ants within distance d (d ≤ m/4) change direction to avoid them instantly, adding spatial dependencies and rerouting.  
- **Integrate Dependencies**: Turn resistance r is determined by r = (x + y)/max(m,n) where (x,y) is initial position, binding grid variables to ant properties. Obstacles and r affect meeting dynamics—e.g., ants may not turn if blocked. Ensure all elements interlock: grid size impacts r and obstacle avoidance, increasing combinatorial reasoning.  

Step 3  
#Rewritten Instruction#:  
Let $m$ and $n$ be positive integers and consider a rectangular grid of $m$ by $n$ unit squares. Some squares contain immovable obstacles, and at time 0, ants (at midpoints of non-obstacle squares) start moving parallel to an edge with speed 1. Each ant has a turn resistance $r = \frac{x + y}{\max(m,n)}$ for its initial position $(x,y)$. When two ants moving in opposite directions meet, both turn $90^\circ$ clockwise if $r \leq 0.5$ or counterclockwise if $r > 0.5$, then continue. If a meeting involves perpendicular directions or more than two ants, no turn occurs. Within distance $d = \lfloor \min(m,n)/4 \rfloor$ of an obstacle, an ant instantly turns $90^\circ$ clockwise to avoid it. Ants fall off at grid edges. Considering all starting positions, obstacles, and directions, determine the latest possible moment the last ant falls off or prove it may not exist.

For all initial setups, find the latest moment the last ant falls off or prove it may not exist.",success,28.26,"['For $m=1$ the answer is clearly correct, so assume $m>1$. In the sequel, the word collision will be used to denote meeting of exactly two ants, moving in opposite directions.\n\nIf at the beginning we place an ant on the southwest corner square facing east and an ant on the southeast corner square facing west, then they will meet in the middle of the bottom row at time $\\frac{m-1}{2}$. After the collision, the ant that moves to the north will stay on the board for another $m-\\frac{1}{2}$ time units and thus we have established an example in which the last ant falls off at time $\\frac{m-1}{2}+m-\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{3 m}{2}-1$. So, we are left to prove that this is the latest possible moment.\n\nConsider any collision of two ants $a$ and $a^{\\prime}$. Let us change the rule for this collision, and enforce these two ants to turn anticlockwise. Then the succeeding behavior of all the ants does not change; the only difference is that $a$ and $a^{\\prime}$ swap their positions. These arguments may be applied to any collision separately, so we may assume that at any collision, either both ants rotate clockwise or both of them rotate anticlockwise by our own choice.\n\nFor instance, we may assume that there are only two types of ants, depending on their initial direction: NE-ants, which move only north or east, and $S W$-ants, moving only south and west. Then we immediately obtain that all ants will have fallen off the board after $2 m-1$ time units. However, we can get a better bound by considering the last moment at which a given ant collides with another ant.\n\nChoose a coordinate system such that the corners of the checkerboard are $(0,0),(m, 0),(m, m)$ and $(0, m)$. At time $t$, there will be no NE-ants in the region $\\{(x, y): x+y<t+1\\}$ and no SW-ants in the region $\\{(x, y): x+y>2 m-t-1\\}$. So if two ants collide at $(x, y)$ at time $t$, we have\n\n$$\nt+1 \\leq x+y \\leq 2 m-t-1\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\n\n\nAnalogously, we may change the rules so that each ant would move either alternatingly north and west, or alternatingly south and east. By doing so, we find that apart from (11) we also have $|x-y| \\leq m-t-1$ for each collision at point $(x, y)$ and time $t$.\n\nTo visualize this, put\n\n$$\nB(t)=\\left\\{(x, y) \\in[0, m]^{2}: t+1 \\leq x+y \\leq 2 m-t-1 \\text { and }|x-y| \\leq m-t-1\\right\\}\n$$\n\nAn ant can thus only collide with another ant at time $t$ if it happens to be in the region $B(t)$. The following figure displays $B(t)$ for $t=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $t=\\frac{7}{2}$ in the case $m=6$ :\n\n<img_3463>\n\nNow suppose that an NE-ant has its last collision at time $t$ and that it does so at the point $(x, y)$ (if the ant does not collide at all, it will fall off the board within $m-\\frac{1}{2}<\\frac{3 m}{2}-1$ time units, so this case can be ignored). Then we have $(x, y) \\in B(t)$ and thus $x+y \\geq t+1$ and $x-y \\geq-(m-t-1)$. So we get\n\n$$\nx \\geq \\frac{(t+1)-(m-t-1)}{2}=t+1-\\frac{m}{2}\n$$\n\nBy symmetry we also have $y \\geq t+1-\\frac{m}{2}$, and hence $\\min \\{x, y\\} \\geq t+1-\\frac{m}{2}$. After this collision, the ant will move directly to an edge, which will take at $\\operatorname{most} m-\\min \\{x, y\\}$ units of time.

We begin with an example showing that there can exist 3986729 cells carrying the same positive number.\n\n<img_3188>\n\nTo describe it, we number the columns from the left to the right and the rows from the bottom to the top by $1,2, \\ldots, 2011$. We will denote each napkin by the coordinates of its lowerleft cell. There are four kinds of napkins: first, we take all napkins $(52 i+36,52 j+1)$ with $0 \\leq j \\leq i \\leq m-2$; second, we use all napkins $(52 i+1,52 j+36)$ with $0 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq m-2$; third, we use all napkins $(52 i+36,52 i+36)$ with $0 \\leq i \\leq m-2$; and finally the napkin $(1,1)$. Different groups of napkins are shown by different types of hatchings in the picture.\n\nNow except for those squares that carry two or more different hatchings, all squares have the number 1 written into them. The number of these exceptional cells is easily computed to be $\\left(52^{2}-35^{2}\\right) m-17^{2}=57392$.\n\nWe are left to prove that 3986729 is an upper bound for the number of cells containing the same number. Consider any configuration of napkins and any positive integer $M$. Suppose there are $g$ cells with a number different from $M$. Then it suffices to show $g \\geq 57392$. Throughout the solution, a line will mean either a row or a column.\n\nConsider any line $\\ell$. Let $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{52 m-17}$ be the numbers written into its consecutive cells. For $i=1,2, \\ldots, 52$, let $s_{i}=\\sum_{t \\equiv i(\\bmod 52)} a_{t}$. Note that $s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{35}$ have $m$ terms each, while $s_{36}, \\ldots, s_{52}$ have $m-1$ terms each. Every napkin intersecting $\\ell$ contributes exactly 1 to each $s_{i}$;\n\n\n\nhence the number $s$ of all those napkins satisfies $s_{1}=\\cdots=s_{52}=s$. Call the line $\\ell$ rich if $s>(m-1) M$ and poor otherwise.\n\nSuppose now that $\\ell$ is rich. Then in each of the sums $s_{36}, \\ldots, s_{52}$ there exists a term greater than $M$; consider all these terms and call the corresponding cells the rich bad cells for this line. So, each rich line contains at least 17 cells that are bad for this line.\n\nIf, on the other hand, $\\ell$ is poor, then certainly $s<m M$ so in each of the sums $s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{35}$ there exists a term less than $M$; consider all these terms and call the corresponding cells the poor bad cells for this line. So, each poor line contains at least 35 cells that are bad for this line.\n\nLet us call all indices congruent to $1,2, \\ldots$, or 35 modulo 52 small, and all other indices, i.e. those congruent to $36,37, \\ldots$, or 52 modulo 52 , big. Recall that we have numbered the columns from the left to the right and the rows from the bottom to the top using the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, 52 m-17$; we say that a line is big or small depending on whether its index is big or small. By definition, all rich bad cells for the rows belong to the big columns, while the poor ones belong to the small columns, and vice versa.\n\nIn each line, we put a strawberry on each cell that is bad for this line. In addition, for each small rich line we put an extra strawberry on each of its (rich) bad cells. A cell gets the strawberries from its row and its column independently.\n\nNotice now that a cell with a strawberry on it contains a number different from $M$. If this cell gets a strawberry by the extra rule, then it contains a number greater than $M$. Moreover, it is either in a small row and in a big column, or vice versa. Suppose that it is in a small row, then it is not bad for its column. So it has not more than two strawberries in this case. On the other hand, if the extra rule is not applied to some cell, then it also has not more than two strawberries. So, the total number $N$ of strawberries is at most $2 g$.\n\nWe shall now estimate $N$ in a different way. For each of the $2 \\cdot 35 \\mathrm{~m}$ small lines, we have introduced at least 34 strawberries if it is rich and at least 35 strawberries if it is poor, so at least 34 strawberries in any case. Similarly, for each of the $2 \\cdot 17(m-1)$ big lines, we put at least $\\min (17,35)=17$ strawberries. Summing over all lines we obtain\n\n$$\n2 g \\geq N \\geq 2(35 m \\cdot 34+17(m-1) \\cdot 17)=2(1479 m-289)=2 \\cdot 57392\n$$\n\nas desired.'
 'We present a different proof of the estimate which is the hard part of the problem. Let $S=35, H=17, m=39$; so the table size is $2011=S m+H(m-1)$, and the napkin size is $52=S+H$. Fix any positive integer $M$ and call a cell vicious if it contains a number distinct\n\n\n\nfrom $M$. We will prove that there are at least $H^{2}(m-1)+2 S H m$ vicious cells.\n\nFirstly, we introduce some terminology. As in the previous solution, we number rows and columns and we use the same notions of small and big indices and lines; so, an index is small if it is congruent to one of the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, S$ modulo $(S+H)$. The numbers $1,2, \\ldots, S+H$ will be known as residues. For two residues $i$ and $j$, we say that a cell is of type $(i, j)$ if the index of its row is congruent to $i$ and the index of its column to $j$ modulo $(S+H)$. The number of vicious cells of this type is denoted by $v_{i j}$.\n\nLet $s, s^{\\prime}$ be two variables ranging over small residues and let $h, h^{\\prime}$ be two variables ranging over big residues. A cell is said to be of class $A, B, C$, or $D$ if its type is of shape $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right),(s, h),(h, s)$, or $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, respectively. The numbers of vicious cells belonging to these classes are denoted in this order by $a, b, c$, and $d$. Observe that each cell belongs to exactly one class.\n\nClaim 1. We have\n\n$$\nm \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b+c}{2 S H}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nProof. Consider an arbitrary small row $r$. Denote the numbers of vicious cells on $r$ belonging to the classes $A$ and $B$ by $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, respectively. As in the previous solution, we obtain that $\\alpha \\geq S$ or $\\beta \\geq H$. So in each case we have $\\frac{\\alpha}{S}+\\frac{\\beta}{H} \\geq 1$.\n\nPerforming this argument separately for each small row and adding up all the obtained inequalities, we get $\\frac{a}{S}+\\frac{b}{H} \\geq m S$. Interchanging rows and columns we similarly get $\\frac{a}{S}+\\frac{c}{H} \\geq m S$. Summing these inequalities and dividing by $2 S$ we get what we have claimed.\n\nClaim 2. Fix two small residue $s, s^{\\prime}$ and two big residues $h, h^{\\prime}$. Then $2 m-1 \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+v_{s h^{\\prime}}+v_{h h^{\\prime}}$. Proof. Each napkin covers exactly one cell of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$. Removing all napkins covering a vicious cell of this type, we get another collection of napkins, which covers each cell of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$ either 0 or $M$ times depending on whether the cell is vicious or not. Hence $\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M$ napkins are left and throughout the proof of Claim 2 we will consider only these remaining napkins. Now, using a red pen, write in each cell the number of napkins covering it. Notice that a cell containing a red number greater than $M$ is surely vicious.\n\nWe call two cells neighbors if they can be simultaneously covered by some napkin. So, each cell of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ has not more than four neighbors of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$, while each cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ has not more than two neighbors of each of the types $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$. Therefore, each red number at a cell of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $4 M$, while each red number at a cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $2 M$.\n\nLet $x, y$, and $z$ be the numbers of cells of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ whose red number belongs to $(M, 2 M]$, $(2 M, 3 M]$, and $(3 M, 4 M]$, respectively. All these cells are vicious, hence $x+y+z \\leq v_{h h^{\\prime}}$. The red numbers appearing in cells of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ clearly sum up to $\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M$. Bounding each of these numbers by a multiple of $M$ we get\n\n$$\n\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M \\leq\\left((m-1)^{2}-(x+y+z)\\right) M+2 x M+3 y M+4 z M\n$$\n\n\n\ni.e.\n\n$$\n2 m-1 \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+x+2 y+3 z \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+v_{h h^{\\prime}}+y+2 z\n$$\n\nSo, to prove the claim it suffices to prove that $y+2 z \\leq v_{s h^{\\prime}}$.\n\nFor a cell $\\delta$ of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ and a cell $\\beta$ of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ we say that $\\delta$ forces $\\beta$ if there are more than $M$ napkins covering both of them. Since each red number in a cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $2 M$, it cannot be forced by more than one cell.\n\nOn the other hand, if a red number in a $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$-cell belongs to $(2 M, 3 M]$, then it forces at least one of its neighbors of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ (since the sum of red numbers in their cells is greater than $2 M)$. Analogously, an $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$-cell with the red number in $(3 M, 4 M]$ forces both its neighbors of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, since their red numbers do not exceed $2 M$. Therefore there are at least $y+2 z$ forced cells and clearly all of them are vicious, as desired.\n\nClaim 3. We have\n\n$$\n2 m-1 \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b+c}{2 S H}+\\frac{d}{H^{2}}\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nProof. Averaging the previous result over all $S^{2} H^{2}$ possibilities for the quadruple $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}, h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, we get $2 m-1 \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b}{S H}+\\frac{d}{H^{2}}$. Due to the symmetry between rows and columns, the same estimate holds with $b$ replaced by $c$. Averaging these two inequalities we arrive at our claim.\n\nNow let us multiply (2) by $H^{2}$, multiply (II) by $\\left(2 S H-H^{2}\\right)$ and add them; we get\n\n$H^{2}(2 m-1)+\\left(2 S H-H^{2}\\right) m \\leq a \\cdot \\frac{H^{2}+2 S H-H^{2}}{S^{2}}+(b+c) \\frac{H^{2}+2 S H-H^{2}}{2 S H}+d=a \\cdot \\frac{2 H}{S}+b+c+d$.\n\nThe left-hand side is exactly $H^{2}(m-1)+2 S H m$, while the right-hand side does not exceed $a+b+c+d$ since $2 H \\leq S$. Hence we come to the desired inequality.']"

We distinguish two cases.\n\nCase 1: $X \\cap M_{1} \\neq \\varnothing$.\n\nA cube from $X \\cap M_{1}$ should appear in all three boxes $X, Y$, and $Z$, so it should lie in $X \\cap Y \\cap Z$.

Indeed, $X \\cap M_{2}$ contains at most $2 n-1$ cubes from $X \\cap Y$ or $X \\cap Z$. Any other cube $a$ in $X \\cap M_{2}$ corresponds to some $a^{\\prime} \\in Y \\cap Z$ (possibly with $a^{\\prime} \\in X$ ), so there are at most $n$ of them. All this results in $\\left|X \\cap M_{2}\\right| \\leqslant(2 n-1)+n=3 n-1$, which is even better than we need (by the assumptions of our case).\n\nSumming up the inequalities from the Claim over all $x$-boxes $X$, we obtain\n\n$$\n4 n_{1}+n_{2} \\leqslant n(3 n+1) .\n$$\n\nObviously, we also have $n_{1}+n_{2}+n_{3}=n^{3}$.\n\nNow we are prepared to estimate $C$.

The proof is by induction on $n$. If $n=1$, we must paint the cube with at most 1 color.\n\nNow, pick a $n \\times n \\times n$ strange cube $A$, where $n \\geqslant 2$. If $A$ is completely invisible, $D=0$ and we are done. Otherwise, pick a non-empty set of colors $\\mathcal{S}$ which corresponds to, say, the boxes $X, Y$ and $Z$ of different orientations.\n\nNow find all cubes in $A$ whose colors are in $\\mathcal{S}$ and make them invisible. Since $X, Y$ and $Z$ are now completely invisible, we can throw them away and focus on the remaining $(n-1) \\times(n-1) \\times(n-1)$ cube $B$. The sets of colors in all the groups for $B$ are the same as the sets for $A$, removing exactly the colors in $\\mathcal{S}$, and no others! Therefore, every nonempty set that appears in one group for $B$ still shows up in all possible orientations (it is possible that an empty set of colors in $B$ only matched $X, Y$ or $Z$ before these were thrown away, but remember we do not require empty sets to match anyway). In summary, $B$ is also strange.\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, we may assume that $B$ has at most $\\frac{(n-1) n(2 n-1)}{6}$ colors. Since there were at most $n^{2}$ different colors in $\\mathcal{S}$, we have that $A$ has at most $\\frac{(n-1) n(2 n-1)}{6}+n^{2}=$ $\\frac{n(n+1)(2 n+1)}{6}$ colors.\n\nFinally, the construction in the previous solution shows a painting scheme (with no invisible cubes) that reaches this maximum, so we are done.']"

2. **Modify loneliness condition:** Replace the simple ""half of |N|"" threshold with a dynamic threshold $\lfloor |N| \cdot \frac{n}{n+1} \rfloor$, which depends on $n$ and varies per point since |N| is position-dependent, introducing fractional adjustments and rounding.

We now define a $\\mathcal{U}$-curve to be the broken line $p_{0} p_{1} \\ldots p_{d}$ such that $p_{0} \\in \\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{V}}, p_{d} \\in \\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{H}}$, and $\\vec{p}_{i-1} \\vec{p}_{i}=\\vec{u}_{i}$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, m$ (see the Figure below to the left).\n\n<img_3839>\n\nConstruction of $\\mathcal{U}$-curve\n\n<img_4021>\n\n<img_3612>\n\nConstruction of $\\mathcal{D}$\n\n\n\nNow, let $\\mathcal{K}_{n}=\\{(i, j): 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n,-n \\leqslant j \\leqslant-1\\}$. Consider all the rays emerging at $O$ and passing through a point from $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$; number them as $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{m}$ in increasing order according to slope. Let $A_{i}$ be the farthest from $O$ lattice point in $r_{i} \\cap \\mathcal{K}_{n}$, set $k_{i}=\\left|r_{i} \\cap \\mathcal{K}_{n}\\right|$, let $\\vec{v}_{i}=\\overrightarrow{O A_{i}}$, and finally denote $\\mathcal{V}=\\left\\{\\vec{v}_{i}: 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant m\\right\\}$; see the Figure above to the right. We will concentrate on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve $d_{0} d_{1} \\ldots d_{m}$; let $\\mathcal{D}$ be the set of all lattice points $p$ such that $p \\geqslant p^{\\prime}$ for some (not necessarily lattice) point $p^{\\prime}$ on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve. In fact, we will show that $\\mathcal{D}=\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nClearly, the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve is symmetric in the line $y=x$. Denote by $D$ the convex hull of $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\n3. We prove that the set $\\mathcal{D}$ contains all stable sets. Let $\\mathcal{S} \\subset \\mathcal{Q}$ be a stable set (recall that it is assumed to be up-right closed and to have a finite complement in $\\mathcal{Q}$ ). Denote by $S$ its convex hull; clearly, the vertices of $S$ are lattice points. The boundary of $S$ consists of two rays (horizontal and vertical ones) along with some $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$-curve for some set of lattice vectors $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$.\n\nClaim 1. For every $\\vec{v}_{i} \\in \\mathcal{V}$, there is a $\\vec{v}_{i}^{*} \\in \\mathcal{V}_{*}$ co-directed with $\\vec{v}$ with $\\left|\\vec{v}_{i}^{*}\\right| \\geqslant|\\vec{v}|$.\n\nProof. Let $\\ell$ be the supporting line of $S$ parallel to $\\vec{v}_{i}$ (i.e., $\\ell$ contains some point of $S$, and the set $S$ lies on one side of $\\ell$ ). Take any point $b \\in \\ell \\cap \\mathcal{S}$ and consider $N(b)$. The line $\\ell$ splits the set $N(b) \\backslash \\ell$ into two congruent parts, one having an empty intersection with $\\mathcal{S}$. Hence, in order for $b$ not to be lonely, at least half of the set $\\ell \\cap N(b)$ (which contains $2 k_{i}$ points) should lie in $S$. Thus, the boundary of $S$ contains a segment $\\ell \\cap S$ with at least $k_{i}+1$ lattice points (including $b$ ) on it; this segment corresponds to the required vector $\\vec{v}_{i}^{*} \\in \\mathcal{V}_{*}$.\n\n<img_3156>\n\nProof of Claim 1\n\n<img_3490>\n\nProof of Claim 2\n\nClaim 2. Each stable set $\\mathcal{S} \\subseteq \\mathcal{Q}$ lies in $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\nProof. To show this, it suffices to prove that the $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$-curve lies in $D$, i.e., that all its vertices do so. Let $p^{\\prime}$ be an arbitrary vertex of the $\\mathcal{V}_{*}$-curve; $p^{\\prime}$ partitions this curve into two parts, $\\mathcal{X}$ (being down-right of $p$ ) and $\\mathcal{Y}$ (being up-left of $p$ ). The set $\\mathcal{V}$ is split now into two parts: $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$ consisting of those $\\vec{v}_{i} \\in \\mathcal{V}$ for which $\\vec{v}_{i}^{*}$ corresponds to a segment in $\\mathcal{X}$, and a similar part $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Notice that the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve consists of several segments corresponding to $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$, followed by those corresponding to $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Hence there is a vertex $p$ of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve separating $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{X}}$ from $\\mathcal{V}_{\\mathcal{Y}}$. Claim 1 now yields that $p^{\\prime} \\geqslant p$, so $p^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{D}$, as required.\n\nClaim 2 implies that the final set $\\mathcal{F}$ is contained in $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\n4. $\\mathcal{D}$ is stable, and its comfortable points are known. Recall the definitions of $r_{i}$; let $r_{i}^{\\prime}$ be the ray complementary to $r_{i}$. By our definitions, the set $N(O)$ contains no points between the rays $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$, as well as between $r_{i}^{\\prime}$ and $r_{i+1}^{\\prime}$.\n\nClaim 3. In the set $\\mathcal{D}$, all lattice points of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve are comfortable.\n\nProof. Let $p$ be any lattice point of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve, belonging to some segment $d_{i} d_{i+1}$. Draw the line $\\ell$ containing this segment. Then $\\ell \\cap \\mathcal{D}$ contains exactly $k_{i}+1$ lattice points, all of which lie in $N(p)$ except for $p$. Thus, exactly half of the points in $N(p) \\cap \\ell$ lie in $\\mathcal{D}$. It remains to show that all points of $N(p)$ above $\\ell$ lie in $\\mathcal{D}$ (recall that all the points below $\\ell$ lack this property).\n\n\n\nNotice that each vector in $\\mathcal{V}$ has one coordinate greater than $n / 2$; thus the neighborhood of $p$ contains parts of at most two segments of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve succeeding $d_{i} d_{i+1}$, as well as at most two of those preceding it.\n\nThe angles formed by these consecutive segments are obtained from those formed by $r_{j}$ and $r_{j-1}^{\\prime}$ (with $i-1 \\leqslant j \\leqslant i+2$ ) by shifts; see the Figure below. All the points in $N(p)$ above $\\ell$ which could lie outside $\\mathcal{D}$ lie in shifted angles between $r_{j}, r_{j+1}$ or $r_{j}^{\\prime}, r_{j-1}^{\\prime}$. But those angles, restricted to $N(p)$, have no lattice points due to the above remark. The claim is proved.\n<img_3487>\n\nProof of Claim 3\n\nClaim 4. All the points of $\\mathcal{D}$ which are not on the boundary of $D$ are crowded.\n\nProof. Let $p \\in \\mathcal{D}$ be such a point. If it is to the up-right of some point $p^{\\prime}$ on the curve, then the claim is easy: the shift of $N\\left(p^{\\prime}\\right) \\cap \\mathcal{D}$ by $\\overrightarrow{p^{\\prime} p}$ is still in $\\mathcal{D}$, and $N(p)$ contains at least one more point of $\\mathcal{D}$ - either below or to the left of $p$. So, we may assume that $p$ lies in a right triangle constructed on some hypothenuse $d_{i} d_{i+1}$. Notice here that $d_{i}, d_{i+1} \\in N(p)$.\n\nDraw a line $\\ell \\| d_{i} d_{i+1}$ through $p$, and draw a vertical line $h$ through $d_{i}$; see Figure below. Let $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ be the parts of $\\mathcal{D}$ lying to the left and to the right of $h$, respectively (points of $\\mathcal{D} \\cap h$ lie in both parts).\n\n<img_3424>\n\nNotice that the vectors $\\overrightarrow{d_{i} p}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i+1} d_{i+2}}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i} d_{i+1}}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i-1} d_{i}}$, and $\\overrightarrow{p d_{i+1}}$ are arranged in non-increasing order by slope. This means that $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ shifted by $\\overrightarrow{d_{i} p}$ still lies in $\\mathcal{D}$, as well as $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ shifted by $\\overrightarrow{d_{i+1} p}$. As we have seen in the proof of Claim 3, these two shifts cover all points of $N(p)$ above $\\ell$, along with those on $\\ell$ to the left of $p$. Since $N(p)$ contains also $d_{i}$ and $d_{i+1}$, the point $p$ is crowded.\n\nThus, we have proved that $\\mathcal{D}=\\mathcal{F}$, and have shown that the lattice points on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve are exactly the comfortable points of $\\mathcal{D}$. It remains to find their number.\n\nRecall the definition of $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$ (see Figure on the first page of the solution). Each segment $d_{i} d_{i+1}$ contains $k_{i}$ lattice points different from $d_{i}$. Taken over all $i$, these points exhaust all the lattice points in the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve, except for $d_{1}$, and thus the number of lattice points on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve is $1+\\sum_{i=1}^{m} k_{i}$. On the other hand, $\\sum_{i=1}^{m} k_{i}$ is just the number of points in $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$, so it equals $n^{2}$. Hence the answer to the problem is $n^{2}+1$.']"

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Variable Circles:** Replace the fixed count (2017) with a variable `n` (number of circles, n ≥ 2). This forces analysis for general `n` and consideration of how the answer depends on it.
2.  **Varying Circle Radii:** Introduce the condition that circles have **arbitrary positive sizes**. Tangents now depend on relative sizes and distances (external vs. internal common tangents), drastically increasing geometric complexity and reasoning about valid segments.
3.  **Visibility Constraint:** Add a condition that **a tangent segment can only be drawn if it lies entirely within the unblocked visible regions defined by the current set of segments and circles**. This creates a dependency on the *order* of drawing and forces consideration of ""line-of-sight"" occlusion, making the process highly non-monotonic in terms of available choices. This intertwines with the geometric and connectivity aspects.
4.  **Maintain Core:** Keep the core action (drawing tangents one-by-one under non-intersection constraints until no more can be drawn) and the goal (finding all possible final counts). Preserve ""mutually external"", ""no two tangent"", ""no three concurrent tangents"".

Then the only tangent segments that can be drawn are between adjacent circles $C_{i}$ and $C_{i+1}$, and exactly three segments can be drawn for each pair. So Luciano will draw exactly $3(n-1)$ segments in this case.\n\n<img_3497>\n\nFor the general case, start from a final configuration (that is, an arrangement of circles and segments in which no further segments can be drawn). The idea of the solution is to continuously resize and move the circles around the plane, one by one (in particular, making sure we never have 4 circles with a common tangent line), and show that the number of segments drawn remains constant as the picture changes. This way, we can reduce any circle/segment configuration to the particular one mentioned above, and the final number of segments must remain at $3 n-3$.\n\nSome preliminary considerations: look at all possible tangent segments joining any two circles. A segment that is tangent to a circle $A$ can do so in two possible orientations - it may come out of $A$ in clockwise or counterclockwise orientation. Two segments touching the same circle with the same orientation will never intersect each other. Each pair $(A, B)$ of circles has 4 choices of tangent segments, which can be identified by their orientations - for example, $(A+, B-)$ would be the segment which comes out of $A$ in clockwise orientation and comes out of $B$ in counterclockwise orientation. In total, we have $2 n(n-1)$ possible segments, disregarding intersections.\n\nNow we pick a circle $C$ and start to continuously move and resize it, maintaining all existing tangent segments according to their identifications, including those involving $C$. We can keep our choice of tangent segments until the configuration reaches a transition. We lose nothing if we assume that $C$ is kept at least $\\varepsilon$ units away from any other circle, where $\\varepsilon$ is a positive, fixed constant; therefore at a transition either: (1) a currently drawn tangent segment $t$ suddenly becomes obstructed; or (2) a currently absent tangent segment $t$ suddenly becomes unobstructed and available.\n\nClaim. A transition can only occur when three circles $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$ are tangent to a common line $\\ell$ containing $t$, in a way such that the three tangent segments lying on $\\ell$ (joining the three circles pairwise) are not obstructed by any other circles or tangent segments (other than $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$ ). Proof. Since (2) is effectively the reverse of (1), it suffices to prove the claim for (1). Suppose $t$ has suddenly become obstructed, and let us consider two cases.\n\n\n\nCase 1: $t$ becomes obstructed by a circle\n\n<img_3256>\n\nThen the new circle becomes the third circle tangent to $\\ell$, and no other circles or tangent segments are obstructing $t$.\n\nCase 2: $t$ becomes obstructed by another tangent segment $t^{\\prime}$ \n\nWhen two segments $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ first intersect each other, they must do so at a vertex of one of them. But if a vertex of $t^{\\prime}$ first crossed an interior point of $t$, the circle associated to this vertex was already blocking $t$ (absurd), or is about to (we already took care of this in case 1). So we only have to analyze the possibility of $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ suddenly having a common vertex. However, if that happens, this vertex must belong to a single circle (remember we are keeping different circles at least $\\varepsilon$ units apart from each other throughout the moving/resizing process), and therefore they must have different orientations with respect to that circle.\n<img_4010>\n\nThus, at the transition moment, both $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ are tangent to the same circle at a common point, that is, they must be on the same line $\\ell$ and hence we again have three circles simultaneously tangent to $\\ell$. Also no other circles or tangent segments are obstructing $t$ or $t^{\\prime}$ (otherwise, they would have disappeared before this transition).\n\nNext, we focus on the maximality of a configuration immediately before and after a transition, where three circles share a common tangent line $\\ell$. Let the three circles be $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$, ordered by their tangent points. The only possibly affected segments are the ones lying on $\\ell$, namely $t_{12}, t_{23}$ and $t_{13}$. Since $C_{2}$ is in the middle, $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ must have different orientations with respect to $C_{2}$. For $C_{1}, t_{12}$ and $t_{13}$ must have the same orientation, while for $C_{3}, t_{13}$ and $t_{23}$ must have the same orientation. The figure below summarizes the situation, showing alternative positions for $C_{1}$ (namely, $C_{1}$ and $C_{1}^{\\prime}$ ) and for $C_{3}\\left(C_{3}\\right.$ and $C_{3}^{\\prime}$ ).\n\n<img_3756>\n\n\n\nNow perturb the diagram slightly so the three circles no longer have a common tangent, while preserving the definition of $t_{12}, t_{23}$ and $t_{13}$ according to their identifications. First note that no other circles or tangent segments can obstruct any of these segments. Also recall that tangent segments joining the same circle at the same orientation will never obstruct each other.\n\nThe availability of the tangent segments can now be checked using simple diagrams.\n\nCase 1: $t_{13}$ passes through $C_{2}$\n\n<img_3220>\n\nIn this case, $t_{13}$ is not available, but both $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ are.\n\nCase 2: $t_{13}$ does not pass through $C_{2}$\n\n<img_3461>\n\nNow $t_{13}$ is available, but $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ obstruct each other, so only one can be drawn.\n\nIn any case, exactly 2 out of these 3 segments can be drawn. Thus the maximal number of segments remains constant as we move or resize the circles, and we are done.'
 ""First note that all tangent segments lying on the boundary of the convex hull of the circles are always drawn since they do not intersect anything else. Now in the final picture, aside from the $n$ circles, the blackboard is divided into regions. We can consider the picture as a plane (multi-)graph $G$ in which the circles are the vertices and the tangent segments are the edges. The idea of this solution is to find a relation between the number of edges and the number of regions in $G$; then, once we prove that $G$ is connected, we can use Euler's formula to finish the problem.\n\nThe boundary of each region consists of 1 or more (for now) simple closed curves, each made of arcs and tangent segments. The segment and the arc might meet smoothly (as in $S_{i}$, $i=1,2, \\ldots, 6$ in the figure below) or not (as in $P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, P_{4}$; call such points sharp corners of the boundary). In other words, if a person walks along the border, her direction would suddenly turn an angle of $\\pi$ at a sharp corner.\n\n\n\n<img_3559>\n\nClaim 1. The outer boundary $B_{1}$ of any internal region has at least 3 sharp corners.\n\nProof. Let a person walk one lap along $B_{1}$ in the counterclockwise orientation. As she does so, she will turn clockwise as she moves along the circle arcs, and not turn at all when moving along the lines. On the other hand, her total rotation after one lap is $2 \\pi$ in the counterclockwise direction! Where could she be turning counterclockwise? She can only do so at sharp corners, and, even then, she turns only an angle of $\\pi$ there. But two sharp corners are not enough, since at least one arc must be present - so she must have gone through at least 3 sharp corners.\n\nClaim 2. Each internal region is simply connected, that is, has only one boundary curve.\n\nProof. Suppose, by contradiction, that some region has an outer boundary $B_{1}$ and inner boundaries $B_{2}, B_{3}, \\ldots, B_{m}(m \\geqslant 2)$. Let $P_{1}$ be one of the sharp corners of $B_{1}$.\n\nNow consider a car starting at $P_{1}$ and traveling counterclockwise along $B_{1}$. It starts in reverse, i.e., it is initially facing the corner $P_{1}$. Due to the tangent conditions, the car may travel in a way so that its orientation only changes when it is moving along an arc. In particular, this means the car will sometimes travel forward. For example, if the car approaches a sharp corner when driving in reverse, it would continue travel forward after the corner, instead of making an immediate half-turn. This way, the orientation of the car only changes in a clockwise direction since the car always travels clockwise around each arc.\n\nNow imagine there is a laser pointer at the front of the car, pointing directly ahead. Initially, the laser endpoint hits $P_{1}$, but, as soon as the car hits an arc, the endpoint moves clockwise around $B_{1}$. In fact, the laser endpoint must move continuously along $B_{1}$ ! Indeed, if the endpoint ever jumped (within $B_{1}$, or from $B_{1}$ to one of the inner boundaries), at the moment of the jump the interrupted laser would be a drawable tangent segment that Luciano missed (see figure below for an example).\n\n<img_3484>\n\n\n\nNow, let $P_{2}$ and $P_{3}$ be the next two sharp corners the car goes through, after $P_{1}$ (the previous lemma assures their existence). At $P_{2}$ the car starts moving forward, and at $P_{3}$ it will start to move in reverse again. So, at $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint is at $P_{3}$ itself. So while the car moved counterclockwise between $P_{1}$ and $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint moved clockwise between $P_{1}$ and $P_{3}$. That means the laser beam itself scanned the whole region within $B_{1}$, and it should have crossed some of the inner boundaries.\n\nClaim 3. Each region has exactly 3 sharp corners.\n\nProof. Consider again the car of the previous claim, with its laser still firmly attached to its front, traveling the same way as before and going through the same consecutive sharp corners $P_{1}, P_{2}$ and $P_{3}$. As we have seen, as the car goes counterclockwise from $P_{1}$ to $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint goes clockwise from $P_{1}$ to $P_{3}$, so together they cover the whole boundary. If there were a fourth sharp corner $P_{4}$, at some moment the laser endpoint would pass through it. But, since $P_{4}$ is a sharp corner, this means the car must be on the extension of a tangent segment going through $P_{4}$. Since the car is not on that segment itself (the car never goes through $P_{4}$ ), we would have 3 circles with a common tangent line, which is not allowed.\n\n<img_3207>\n\nWe are now ready to finish the solution. Let $r$ be the number of internal regions, and $s$ be the number of tangent segments. Since each tangent segment contributes exactly 2 sharp corners to the diagram, and each region has exactly 3 sharp corners, we must have $2 s=3 r$. Since the graph corresponding to the diagram is connected, we can use Euler's formula $n-s+r=1$ and find $s=3 n-3$ and $r=2 n-2$.""]"

- Add a condition: Introduce the $\gcd$ requirement for $c$ to avoid trivial cases and link $c$ directly to the properties of $b$, increasing interdependence.  
- Reasons: The base generalization complicates termination conditions, the $c$-range modification adds dependency on $b$ and reduces arbitrariness, and the coprimality condition enforces non-trivial periods.

By rotational symmetry, the dominoes in the bottom region are horizontal, and so on. This shows that the partition exists and is unique.\n<img_3889>\n\nIt remains to show that this value of $k$ is the smallest possible. Assume that only $k<2 n$ cells are marked, and there exists a partition $P$ satisfying the requirement. It suffices to show there exists another desirable partition distinct from $P$. Let $d$ be the main diagonal of the board.\n\nConstruct the following graph with edges of two colours. Its vertices are the cells of the board. Connect two vertices with a red edge if they belong to the same domino of $P$. Connect two vertices with a blue edge if their reflections in $d$ are connected by a red edge. It is possible that two vertices are connected by edges of both colours. Clearly, each vertex has both red and blue degrees equal to 1 . Thus the graph splits into cycles where the colours of edges in each cycle alternate (a cycle may have length 2).\n\nConsider any cell $c$ lying on the diagonal $d$. Its two edges are symmetrical with respect to $d$. Thus they connect $c$ to different cells. This shows $c$ belongs to a cycle $C(c)$ of length at least 4. Consider a part of this cycle $c_{0}, c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{m}$ where $c_{0}=c$ and $m$ is the least positive integer such that $c_{m}$ lies on $d$. Clearly, $c_{m}$ is distinct from $c$. From the construction, the path symmetrical to this with respect to $d$ also lies in the graph, and so these paths together form $C(c)$. Hence, $C(c)$ contains exactly two cells from $d$. Then all $2 n$ cells in $d$ belong to $n$ cycles $C_{1}, C_{2}, \\ldots, C_{n}$, each has length at least 4.\n\nBy the Pigeonhole Principle, there exists a cycle $C_{i}$ containing at most one of the $k$ marked cells. We modify $P$ as follows. We remove all dominoes containing the vertices of $C_{i}$, which\n\n\n\ncorrespond to the red edges of $C_{i}$. Then we put the dominoes corresponding to the blue edges of $C_{i}$. Since $C_{i}$ has at least 4 vertices, the resultant partition $P^{\\prime}$ is different from $P$. Clearly, no domino in $P^{\\prime}$ contains two marked cells as $C_{i}$ contains at most one marked cell. This shows the partition is not unique and hence $k$ cannot be less than $2 n$.']"

#Elements Identified#:
- Variables: n (integer ≥2), k (number of cable cars per company).
- Entities: Two cable car companies (A and B) operating cable cars.
- Constraints: Cable cars are strictly ordered by start and end points; for i<j, start j > start i and end j > end i.
- Positioning: Checkpoints are linear and ordered from 1 to n² bottom to top.
- Reachability: Two points are linked if reachable via one or more cable cars of one company without foot movement.
- Objective: Find the smallest k such that there are always two points linked by both companies.
- Theme: Cable car networks on a mountain slope with ordered checkpoints.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. Increase the number of companies to a general integer c ≥ 2 to force the pair to be linked by all companies, adding a dimension.
2. Add a minimum elevation gain: Each cable car must have at least r positions between start and end (F - S ≥ r), with r a given integer, 1 ≤ r ≤ n², to constrain individual cable car spans and make connectivity less uniform.
3. Relax the ordering constraint: Only starting points are strictly ordered for the cable cars; finishing points are not necessarily ordered with respect to the indices, increasing uncertainty in the system. This modifies the original strict ordering of both start and end points to a partial structure.
4. Ensure all plan components are integrated: The variables (n, c, r) are inputs, the min gain depends on r, and the disordered finishing points interact with the min gain to affect reachability paths, requiring more complex combinatorial analysis for the guarantee.

#Elements Identified#:
- Initial state: Blackboard starts with 2020 identical numbers (all 1s).
- Actions per round: Player A selects any two numbers to erase; Player B chooses to write either the sum or the absolute difference of these numbers.
- Termination conditions: Game ends if (1) one number exceeds the sum of all others or (2) all numbers are zero.
- Objective: Cookies given to A equal the count of numbers at termination; A maximizes this, B minimizes it.
- Key theme: Strategic manipulation of the board state through sequential operations to influence count and termination.

Step 2
#Plan#:
- Modify initial state: Replace uniform numbers with a diverse multiset (1000 ones, 500 twos, 520 zeros) to introduce variability in values and increase strategic depth in early rounds.
- Expand B's actions: Add a third option (min{x,y}) for B to write, creating more decision paths and complicating state transitions.
- Add termination condition: Introduce a new clause (all numbers identical and positive) to terminate, which interacts with the diverse start and min operation for added strategic complexity.
- Ensure coherence: Changes interlink—diverse values affect min and termination; all-identical condition depends on B’s choices; min operation influences value homogeneity and count. Maintain clear objectives and deterministic play.

We prove that, in fact, if a board initially contains an even number $n>1$ of ones, then $A$ can guarantee to obtain $S_{2}(n)$, but not more, cookies. The binary representation of 2020 is $2020=\\overline{11111100100}_{2}$, so $S_{2}(2020)=7$, and the answer follows.\n\nA strategy for A. At any round, while possible, A chooses two equal nonzero numbers on the board. Clearly, while $A$ can make such choice, the game does not terminate. On the other hand, $A$ can follow this strategy unless the game has already terminated. Indeed, if $A$ always chooses two equal numbers, then each number appearing on the board is either 0 or a power of 2 with non-negative integer exponent, this can be easily proved using induction on the number of rounds. At the moment when $A$ is unable to follow the strategy all nonzero numbers on the board are distinct powers of 2 . If the board contains at least one such power, then the largest of those powers is greater than the sum of the others. Otherwise there are only zeros on the blackboard, in both cases the game terminates.\n\nFor every number on the board, define its range to be the number of ones it is obtained from. We can prove by induction on the number of rounds that for any nonzero number $k$ written by $B$ its range is $k$, and for any zero written by $B$ its range is a power of 2 . Thus at the end of each round all the ranges are powers of two, and their sum is $n$. Since $S_{2}(a+b) \\leqslant S_{2}(a)+S_{2}(b)$ for any positive integers $a$ and $b$, the number $n$ cannot be represented as a sum of less than $S_{2}(n)$ powers of 2 . Thus at the end of each round the board contains at least $S_{2}(n)$ numbers, while $A$ follows the above strategy. So $A$ can guarantee at least $S_{2}(n)$ cookies for himself.\n\nA strategy for $B$. Denote $s=S_{2}(n)$.\n\nLet $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k}$ be the numbers on the board at some moment of the game after $B$ 's turn or at the beginning of the game. Say that a collection of $k \\operatorname{signs} \\varepsilon_{1}, \\ldots, \\varepsilon_{k} \\in\\{+1,-1\\}$ is balanced if\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\varepsilon_{i} x_{i}=0\n$$\n\nWe say that a situation on the board is good if $2^{s+1}$ does not divide the number of balanced collections. An appropriate strategy for $B$ can be explained as follows: Perform a move so that the situation remains good, while it is possible. We intend to show that in this case $B$ will not lose more than $S_{2}(n)$ cookies. For this purpose, we prove several lemmas.\n\nFor a positive integer $k$, denote by $\\nu_{2}(k)$ the exponent of the largest power of 2 that divides $k$. Recall that, by Legendre's formula, $\\nu_{2}(n !)=n-S_{2}(n)$ for every positive integer $n$.\n\n\n\nLemma 1. The initial situation is good.\n\nProof. In the initial configuration, the number of balanced collections is equal to $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n \\\\ n / 2\\end{array}\\right)$. We have\n\n$$\n\\nu_{2}\\left(\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nn \\\\\nn / 2\n\\end{array}\\right)\\right)=\\nu_{2}(n !)-2 \\nu_{2}((n / 2) !)=\\left(n-S_{2}(n)\\right)-2\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-S_{2}(n / 2)\\right)=S_{2}(n)=s\n$$\n\nHence $2^{s+1}$ does not divide the number of balanced collections, as desired.\n\nLemma 2. B may play so that after each round the situation remains good.\n\nProof. Assume that the situation $\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k}\\right)$ before a round is good, and that $A$ erases two numbers, $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of all balanced collections, $N_{+}$be the number of those having $\\varepsilon_{p}=\\varepsilon_{q}$, and $N_{-}$be the number of other balanced collections. Then $N=N_{+}+N_{-}$. Now, if $B$ replaces $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$ by $x_{p}+x_{q}$, then the number of balanced collections will become $N_{+}$. If $B$ replaces $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$ by $\\left|x_{p}-x_{q}\\right|$, then this number will become $N_{-}$. Since $2^{s+1}$ does not divide $N$, it does not divide one of the summands $N_{+}$and $N_{-}$, hence $B$ can reach a good situation after the round.\n\nLemma 3. Assume that the game terminates at a good situation. Then the board contains at most $s$ numbers.\n\nProof. Suppose, one of the numbers is greater than the sum of the other numbers. Then the number of balanced collections is 0 and hence divisible by $2^{s+1}$. Therefore, the situation is not good.\n\nThen we have only zeros on the blackboard at the moment when the game terminates. If there are $k$ of them, then the number of balanced collections is $2^{k}$. Since the situation is good, we have $k \\leqslant s$.\n\nBy Lemmas 1 and 2, $B$ may act in such way that they keep the situation good. By Lemma 3, when the game terminates, the board contains at most $s$ numbers. This is what we aimed to prove.""]"

 'Harry has built a Turing machine to flip the coins for him. The machine is initially positioned at the $k^{\\text {th }}$ coin, where there are $k$ heads (and the position before the first coin is considered to be the $0^{\\text {th }}$ coin). The machine then moves according to the following rules, stopping when it reaches the position before the first coin: if the coin at its current position is $H$, it flips the coin and moves to the previous coin, while if the coin at its current position is $T$, it flips the coin and moves to the next position.\n\nConsider the maximal sequences of consecutive moves in the same direction. Suppose the machine has $a$ consecutive moves to the next coin, before a move to the previous coin. After those $a$ moves, the $a$ coins flipped in those moves are all heads, as is the coin the machine is now at, so at least the next $a+1$ moves will all be moves to the previous coin. Similarly, $a$ consecutive moves to the previous coin are followed by at least $a+1$ consecutive moves to\n\n\n\nthe next coin. There cannot be more than $n$ consecutive moves in the same direction, so this proves that the process terminates (with a move from the first coin to the position before the first coin).\n\nThus we have a (possibly empty) sequence $a_{1}<\\cdots<a_{t} \\leqslant n$ giving the lengths of maximal sequences of consecutive moves in the same direction, where the final $a_{t}$ moves must be moves to the previous coin, ending before the first coin. We claim there is a bijection between initial configurations of the coins and such sequences. This gives\n\n$$\nE(n)=\\frac{1}{2}(1+2+\\cdots+n)=\\frac{n(n+1)}{4}\n$$\n\nas required, since each $i$ with $1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n$ will appear in half of the sequences, and will contribute $i$ to the number of moves when it does.\n\nTo see the bijection, consider following the sequence of moves backwards, starting with the machine just before the first coin and all coins showing tails. This certainly determines a unique configuration of coins that could possibly correspond to the given sequence. Furthermore, every coin flipped as part of the $a_{j}$ consecutive moves is also flipped as part of all subsequent sequences of $a_{k}$ consecutive moves, for all $k>j$, meaning that, as we follow the moves backwards, each coin is always in the correct state when flipped to result in a move in the required direction. (Alternatively, since there are $2^{n}$ possible configurations of coins and $2^{n}$ possible such ascending sequences, the fact that the sequence of moves determines at most one configuration of coins, and thus that there is an injection from configurations of coins to such ascending sequences, is sufficient for it to be a bijection, without needing to show that coins are in the right state as we move backwards.)'

1915,"On a flat plane in Camelot, King Arthur builds a labyrinth $\mathfrak{L}$ consisting of $n$ walls, each of which is an infinite straight line. No two walls are parallel, and no three walls have a common point. Merlin then paints one side of each wall entirely red and the other side entirely blue.

At the intersection of two walls there are four corners: two diagonally opposite corners where a red side and a blue side meet, one corner where two red sides meet, and one corner where two blue sides meet. At each such intersection, there is a two-way door connecting the two diagonally opposite corners at which sides of different colours meet.

After Merlin paints the walls, Morgana then places some knights in the labyrinth. The knights can walk through doors, but cannot walk through walls.

#Elements Identified#:
- **Structure:** $n$ infinite straight walls, no parallels, no triple points.  
- **Painting:** Merlin paints one side per wall red/blue arbitrarily.  
- **Doors:** Diagonal different-color corners at intersections are doors.  
- **Movement:** Knights traverse doors but not walls.  
- **Problem Scope:** Find $k(\mathfrak{L})$ - the max guaranteed number of knights that *cannot* meet, minimized over Merlin's colorings, for a given wall arrangement ($\mathfrak{L}$).  
- **Output Goal:** Characterize all possible values of $k(\mathfrak{L})$ for all wall labyrinths with $n$ walls.  

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Geometric Complexity:** Replace infinite straight walls with bounded convex polygonal walls intersecting transversely. This creates intersections of higher degree (not just 4) and complex corridors/junctions.  
2.  **Dynamic Connectivity:** Modify the door mechanism. Knights traverse only along an edge (finite wall segment between intersections) that adjoins a region where both its adjacent colored sides satisfy a specific, coloring-dependent rule (e.g., both sides red) rather than simply using ""doors"". Movement depends *locally* on the colors of the two walls defining the edge.  
3.  **Environment State:** Introduce heights/levels ($h: \text{Regions} \to \mathbb{Z}$) such that knights can move from region $A$ to region $B$ only if $|h(A) - h(B)| \leq 1$ *and* the edge traversal condition is met. This adds a controllable, graph-independent constraint.  
4.  **Problem Scope Adaptation:** The core question (max guaranteed unreachable knights) remains the *same*. However, the characterization of $k(\mathfrak{L})$ must now consider the *worst-case* height assignment for the given polygonal wall arrangement $\mathfrak{L}$, *after* Merlin's coloring. Morgana chooses knight placements *and* the height function strategically to maximize the unreachable set, countering Merlin.

The claim is true for $n=0$ as, when there are no walls, the plane forms a single region. When placing the $n^{\\text {th }}$ wall, it intersects each of the $n-1$ other walls exactly once and hence splits each of $n$ of the regions formed by those other walls into two regions. By the induction hypothesis, this yields $\\left(\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1\\right)+n=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1$ regions, proving the claim.\n\nNow let $G$ be the graph with vertices given by the $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1$ regions, and with two regions connected by an edge if there is a door between them.\n\nWe now show that no matter how Merlin paints the $n$ walls, Morgana can place at least $n+1$ knights. No matter how the walls are painted, there are exactly $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)$ intersection points, each of which corresponds to a single edge in $G$. Consider adding the edges of $G$ sequentially and note that each edge reduces the number of connected components by at most one. Therefore the number of connected components of $\\mathrm{G}$ is at least $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1-\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)=n+1$. If Morgana places a knight in regions corresponding to different connected components of $G$, then no two knights can ever meet.\n\nNow we give a construction showing that, no matter what shape the labyrinth is, Merlin can colour it such that there are exactly $n+1$ connected components, allowing Morgana to place at most $n+1$ knights.\n\nFirst, we choose a coordinate system on the labyrinth so that none of the walls run due north-south, or due east-west. We then have Merlin paint the west face of each wall red, and the east face of each wall blue. We label the regions according to how many walls the region is on the east side of: the labels are integers between 0 and $n$.\n\nWe claim that, for each $i$, the regions labelled $i$ are connected by doors. First, we note that for each $i$ with $0 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n$ there is a unique region labelled $i$ which is unbounded to the north.\n\nNow, consider a knight placed in some region with label $i$, and ask them to walk north (moving east or west by following the walls on the northern sides of regions, as needed). This knight will never get stuck: each region is convex, and so, if it is bounded to the north, it has a single northernmost vertex with a door northwards to another region with label $i$.\n\nEventually it will reach a region which is unbounded to the north, which will be the unique such region with label $i$. Hence every region with label $i$ is connected to this particular region, and so all regions with label $i$ are connected to each other.\n\nAs a result, there are exactly $n+1$ connected components, and Morgana can place at most $n+1$ knights.'
 'We give another description of a strategy for Merlin to paint the walls so that Morgana can place no more than $n+1$ knights.\n\nMerlin starts by building a labyrinth of $n$ walls of his own design. He places walls in turn with increasing positive gradients, placing each so far to the right that all intersection points of previously-placed lines lie to the left of it. He paints each in such a way that blue is on the left and red is on the right.\n\nFor example, here is a possible sequence of four such lines $\\ell_{1}, \\ell_{2}, \\ell_{3}, \\ell_{4}$ :\n\n<img_3427>\n\nWe say that a region is ""on the right"" if it has $x$-coordinate unbounded above (note that if we only have one wall, then both regions are on the right). We claim inductively that, after placing $n$ lines, there are $n+1$ connected components in the resulting labyrinth, each of which contains exactly one region on the right. This is certainly true after placing 0 lines, as then there is only one region (and hence one connected component) and it is on the right.\n\nWhen placing the $n^{\\text {th }}$ line, it then cuts every one of the $n-1$ previously placed lines, and since it is to the right of all intersection points, the regions it cuts are exactly the $n$ regions on the right.\n\n<img_3985>\n\nThe addition of this line leaves all previous connected components with exactly one region on the right, and creates a new connected component containing exactly one region, and that region is also on the right. As a result, by induction, this particular labyrinth will have $n+1$ connected components.\n\nHaving built this labyrinth, Merlin then moves the walls one-by-one (by a sequence of continuous translations and rotations of lines) into the proper position of the given labyrinth, in such a way that no two lines ever become parallel.\n\n\n\nThe only time the configuration is changed is when one wall is moved through an intersection point of two others:\n<img_3360>\n\nNote that all moves really do switch between two configurations like this: all sets of three lines have this colour configuration initially, and the rules on rotations mean they are preserved (in particular, we cannot create three lines creating a triangle with three red edges inwards, or three blue edges inwards).\n\nHowever, as can be seen, such a move preserves the number of connected components, so in the painting this provides for Arthur\'s actual labyrinth, Morgana can still only place at most $n+1$ knights.']"

In the first round, Alice takes $n$ pebbles and distributes them into the 60 boxes as she wishes. Each subsequent round consists of two steps:

(a) Bob chooses an integer $k$ with $1 \leqslant k \leqslant 59$ and splits the boxes into the two groups $B_{1}, \ldots, B_{k}$ and $B_{k+1}, \ldots, B_{60}$.

(b) Alice picks one of these two groups, adds one pebble to each box in that group, and removes one pebble from each box in the other group.

- Bob's action of choosing a split point \(k\).  
- Alice's action of adding/removing one pebble per box in groups.  
- Bob's win condition (any box having zero pebbles).  
- Initial distribution of pebbles by Alice.  
- Theme: Preventing depletion via combinatorial optimization.  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
1. **Variable boxes**: Replace the fixed 60 boxes with an arbitrary even integer \(m \geq 2\) of boxes, requiring analysis for general \(m\).  
2. **Enhanced splitting mechanism**: Instead of a single split, Bob assigns a vector-dependent action: Bob chooses an integer weight \(w \geq 1\) in addition to \(k\), and the groups are modified asymmetrically with \(\pm w\) adjustments.  
3. **Structural generalization**: Change Bob's split to include a contiguous *subsequence* (not necessarily prefix-suffix splitting).  
4. **Win condition refinement**: Bob wins if the minimum pebble count is non-positive, universally broadening the win condition.  
*Justification*: Variables are interconnected—\(m\) scales complexity, weights introduce dynamic variance, subsequence choosing demands advanced game-tree analysis, and the win condition refines strategy constraints.

If there exist a positive integer $k$ such that there are at least $2 k$ boxes that have at most $k$ pebbles each then Bob can force a win.\n\nProof. We ignore the other boxes. First, Bob makes a $k$-move (splits the $2 k$ boxes into two groups of $k$ boxes each). Without loss of generality, Alice picks the left group. Then Bob makes a $(k+1)$-move, ... a $(2 k-1)$-move.

For each of Bob's $N-1$ possible choices, consider the subset of rounds in which he makes that choice. In that subset of rounds, Alice alternates between picking the left group and picking the right group; the first time Bob makes that choice, Alice picks the group containing the $K^{\\text {th }}$ box. Thus, at any time during the game, the number of pebbles in each box depends only on which choices Bob has made an odd number of times.

Let $K=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor$. For Bob's strategy, we consider a configuration $X$ with at most $M-1$ pebbles, and we make use of Observation A. Consider two configurations with $M$ pebbles: $V_{K}$ and $V_{N+1-K}$ (if $n$ is odd, they are the same configuration; if $n$ is even, one is the reverse of the other). The configuration $X$ has fewer pebbles than $V_{K}$ in at least one box, and fewer pebbles than $V_{N+1-K}$ in at least one box.\n\nSuppose first that, with respect to one of those configurations (without loss of generality $V_{K}$ ), $X$ has fewer pebbles in one of the boxes in the half where they have $1,2, \\ldots,\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rceil$ pebbles (the right half in $V_{K}$ if $N$ is even; if $N$ is odd, we can take it to be the right half, without loss of generality, as the configuration is symmetric). Note that the number cannot be fewer in the box with 1 pebble in $V_{K}$, because then it would have 0 pebbles. Bob then does a $K$-move. If Alice picks the right group, the total number of pebbles goes down and we restart Bob's strategy with a smaller number of pebbles. If Alice picks the left group, Bob follows with a $(K+1)$-move, a $(K+2)$-move, and so on; by Observation A we may assume Alice always picks the left group. But whichever box in the right half had fewer pebbles in $X$ than in $V_{K}$ ends up with 0 pebbles at some point in this sequence of moves.\n\nOtherwise, $N$ is even, and for both of those configurations, there are fewer pebbles in $X$ only on the $2,3, \\ldots, \\frac{N}{2}+1$ side.

If each \(x \in \mathcal{F}\) has exactly \(k\) distinct scales, what is the maximum possible size of \(\mathcal{F}\) in terms of \(b\), \(k\), and the choice of \(N\)?","Step 1
#Elements Identified#:
- **Variables and functions**: Real numbers \(x\), \(y\); integer \(d\); set \(\mathcal{F}\) of reals; the function \(D(x, y)\) defined based on \(|x - y|\) using powers of 2 to determine the scale; positive integer \(k\) bounding the number of distinct scales per point.
- **Conditions**: For any \(x, y \in \mathcal{F}\) with \(x \neq y\), \(D(x, y)\) is uniquely defined by \(2^d \leq |x - y| < 2^{d+1}\); each \(x\) has at most \(k\) distinct scale values \(D(x, y)\) for \(y \neq y\) in \(\mathcal{F}\).
- **Participants and processes**: The set \(\mathcal{F}\) and its points; for each point \(x\), scales are derived from pairwise distances to other points, then constrained by \(k\).
- **Theme**: Combinatorial optimization over metric differences, with an entropy-like constraint per point from dyadic distance intervals; the goal is to maximize set size under scale diversification limits.

Step 2
#Plan#:
- **Generalize the scale base**: Replace the dyadic base 2 with an arbitrary integer base \(b > 1\), so \(D(x, y)\) adapts to \(b^d \leq |x - y| < b^{d+1}\). This transforms the scale parameterization, adding a variable \(b\) that interacts with \(k\) during set construction.
- **Concretize constraints**: Instead of at most \(k\) distinct scales, require exactly \(k\) distinct scales per point to force tightness in the scale distribution, increasing proof complexity by eliminating trivial additions.
- **Add real-world structure**: Assume \(\mathcal{F}\) is a finite subset of integers within a bounded interval \([1, N]\), introducing a third parameter \(N\) that must be chosen or optimized alongside set size optimization, creating dependencies between scale resolution, set density, and interval limits.
- **Ensure coherence**: Bases \(b\) and \(N\) are now with clear criteria (e.g., \(b > 1\) integer, \(N\) upper bound); scales must satisfy integer consistency from dyadic theme; modified elements are interconnected as \(b\) affects scale graininess, \(k\) controls per-point dyadic variety, and \(N\) restricts exploration space.

Substituting $x=0$ and $y=f(0)$ into (1) we learn that the number $z=-f(f(0))$ satisfies $f(z)=-1$.

By applying (3) with $y=x$ and (2) in this order, we obtain\n\n$$\nf(x+1)-f(x)=f(x-f(x))+1=f(f(x-1-f(x)))+1 .\n$$\n\nSince (3) shows $f(x-1-f(x))=f(x)-f(x)-1=-1$, this simplifies to\n\n$$\nf(x+1)=f(x)+A\n$$\n\nwhere $A=f(-1)+1$ is some absolute constant.\n\nNow a standard induction in both directions reveals that $f$ is indeed linear and that in fact we have $f(x)=A x+B$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where $B=f(0)$. Substituting this into (2) we obtain that\n\n$$\nA x+(A+B)=A^{2} x+(A B+B)\n$$\n\nholds for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$; applying this to $x=0$ and $x=1$ we infer $A+B=A B+B$ and $A^{2}=A$. The second equation leads to $A=0$ or $A=1$. In case $A=1$, the first equation gives $B=1$, meaning that $f$ has to be the successor function. If $A=0$, then $f$ is constant and (1) shows that its constant value has to be -1 . Thereby the solution is complete.'
 'We commence by deriving (2) and (3) as in the first solution. Now provided that $f$ is injective, (2) tells us that $f$ is the successor function. Thus we may assume from now on that $f$ is not injective, i.e., that there are two integers $a>b$ with $f(a)=f(b)$. A straightforward induction using (2) in the induction step reveals that we have $f(a+n)=f(b+n)$ for all nonnegative integers $n$. Consequently, the sequence $\\gamma_{n}=f(b+n)$ is periodic and thus in particular bounded, which means that the numbers\n\n$$\n\\varphi=\\min _{n \\geqslant 0} \\gamma_{n} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\psi=\\max _{n \\geqslant 0} \\gamma_{n}\n$$\n\nexist.\n\nLet us pick any integer $y$ with $f(y)=\\varphi$ and then an integer $x \\geqslant a$ with $f(x-f(y))=\\varphi$.

Due to (3) and the result from the previous paragraph we get\n\n$$\nf(y)=f(x+1)-f(x-f(y))-1=(-1)-(-1)-1=-1 .\n$$\n\nThereby the problem is solved.'
 'Set $d=f(0)$. By plugging $x=f(y)$ into (1) we obtain\n\n$$\nf^{3}(y)=f(y)+d+1\n\\tag{4}\n$$\n\nfor all $y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where the left-hand side abbreviates $f(f(f(y)))$. When we replace $x$ in (1) by $f(x)$ we obtain $f(f(x)-f(y))=f^{3}(x)-f(y)-1$ and as a consequence of (4) this simplifies to\n\n$$\nf(f(x)-f(y))=f(x)-f(y)+d\n\\tag{5}\n$$\n\nNow we consider the set\n\n$$\nE=\\{f(x)-d \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}\n\\tag{6}\n$$\n\nGiven two integers $a$ and $b$ from $E$, we may pick some integers $x$ and $y$ with $f(x)=a+d$ and $f(y)=b+d$; now (5) tells us that $f(a-b)=(a-b)+d$, which means that $a-b$ itself exemplifies $a-b \\in E$.

If $E=\\{0\\}$, then $f$ is a constant function and (1) implies that the only value attained by $f$ is indeed -1 .\n\nSo let us henceforth suppose that $E$ contains some number besides zero. It is known that in this case (6) entails $E$ to be the set of all integer multiples of some positive integer $k$.

In plain English, this means that on any residue class modulo $k$ the function $f$ is linear with slope 1 .\n\nNow by (7) the set of all values attained by $f$ is such a residue class. Hence, there exists an absolute constant $c$ such that $f(f(x))=f(x)+c$ holds for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Thereby (1) simplifies to\n\n$$\nf(x-f(y))=f(x)-f(y)+c-1 .\n\\tag{9}\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, considering (1) modulo $k$ we obtain $d \\equiv-1(\\bmod k)$ because of $(7)$. So by (7) again, $f$ attains the value -1 .\n\nThus we may apply (9) to some integer $y$ with $f(y)=-1$, which gives $f(x+1)=f(x)+c$. So $f$ is a linear function with slope $c$. Hence, (8) leads to $c=1$, wherefore there is an absolute constant $d^{\\prime}$ with $f(x)=x+d^{\\prime}$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Using this for $x=0$ we obtain $d^{\\prime}=d$ and finally (4) discloses $d=1$, meaning that $f$ is indeed the successor function.']"

- The function \( f \) maps real numbers to real numbers.
- The equation structure includes compositions of \( f \) (e.g., \( f(x + f(x+y)) \)), a multiplication term \( x y \), and a linear term \( y f(x) \).
- The equation must hold unconditionally for all real values.

Step 2
#Plan#:
- Increase the number of variables: Add a third real variable \( z \) and extend the equation to hold for all \( x, y, z \in \mathbb{R} \).
- Modify the equation's structure: Replace \( f(x y) \) with \( f(x y + z) \) on the left-hand side and add \( + z \) to the right-hand side to incorporate \( z \) meaningfully and create additional complexity.
- Concretize the equation: Make the dependency on \( z \) explicit in a way that increases nesting and introduces a linear term, requiring more intricate substitution and reasoning.
- Ensure interconnectedness: The new terms \( f(x y + z) \) and \( z \) will interact with the original equation, demanding simultaneous handling of multiple cases and substitutions.
- Avoid excessive variables: Only \( z \) is added, with clear criteria (all real numbers) to maintain solvability while increasing depth.

On the other hand, $2^{\\beta}=a c-b>$ $(a-1) c \\geqslant 2 c$ implies in view of (1) that $a$ and $b$ are smaller than $2^{\\beta-1}$. All this is only possible if $\\vartheta=1$ and $a+b=2^{\\beta-1}$. Now (3) yields\n\n$$\na c-b=2(a+b),\n\\tag{6}\n$$\n\nwhence $4 b>a+3 b=a(c-1) \\geqslant a b$, which in turn yields $a=3$.\n\nSo (6) simplifies to $c=b+2$ and (2) tells us that $b(b+2)-3=(b-1)(b+3)$ is a power of 2. Consequently, the factors $b-1$ and $b+3$ are powers of 2 themselves. Since their difference is 4 , this is only possible if $b=5$ and thus $c=7$. Thereby the solution is complete.'
 'As in the beginning of the first solution, we observe that $a, b, c \\geqslant 2$. Depending on the parities of $a, b$, and $c$ we distinguish three cases.\n\nCase 1. The numbers $a, b$, and $c$ are even.\n\nLet $2^{A}, 2^{B}$, and $2^{C}$ be the largest powers of 2 dividing $a, b$, and $c$ respectively. We may assume without loss of generality that $1 \\leqslant A \\leqslant B \\leqslant C$. Now $2^{B}$ is the highest power of 2 dividing $a c-b$, whence $a c-b=2^{B} \\leqslant b$. Similarly, we deduce $b c-a=2^{A} \\leqslant a$. Adding both estimates we get $(a+b) c \\leqslant 2(a+b)$, whence $c \\leqslant 2$. So $c=2$ and thus $A=B=C=1$; moreover, we must have had equality throughout, i.e., $a=2^{A}=2$ and $b=2^{B}=2$. We have thereby found the solution $(a, b, c)=(2,2,2)$.\n\nCase 2. The numbers $a, b$, and $c$ are odd.\n\nIf any two of these numbers are equal, say $a=b$, then $a c-b=a(c-1)$ has a nontrivial odd divisor and cannot be a power of 2 . Hence $a, b$, and $c$ are distinct. So we may assume without loss of generality that $a<b<c$.\n\nLet $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ denote the nonnegative integers for which $b c-a=2^{\\alpha}$ and $a c-b=2^{\\beta}$ hold. Clearly, we have $\\alpha>\\beta$, and thus $2^{\\beta}$ divides\n\n$$\na \\cdot 2^{\\alpha}-b \\cdot 2^{\\beta}=a(b c-a)-b(a c-b)=b^{2}-a^{2}=(b+a)(b-a) .\n$$\n\nSince $a$ is odd, it is not possible that both factors $b+a$ and $b-a$ are divisible by 4 . Consequently, one of them has to be a multiple of $2^{\\beta-1}$. Hence one of the numbers $2(b+a)$ and $2(b-a)$ is divisible by $2^{\\beta}$ and in either case we have\n\n$$\na c-b=2^{\\beta} \\leqslant 2(a+b) .\n\\tag{7}\n$$\n\nThis in turn yields $(a-1) b<a c-b<4 b$ and thus $a=3$ (recall that $a$ is odd and larger than 1). Substituting this back into (7) we learn $c \\leqslant b+2$. But due to the parity $b<c$ entails that $b+2 \\leqslant c$ holds as well. So we get $c=b+2$ and from $b c-a=(b-1)(b+3)$ being a power of 2 it follows that $b=5$ and $c=7$.\n\nCase 3. Among $a, b$, and $c$ both parities occur.\n\nWithout loss of generality, we suppose that $c$ is odd and that $a \\leqslant b$. We are to show that $(a, b, c)$ is either $(2,2,3)$ or $(2,6,11)$. As at least one of $a$ and $b$ is even, the expression $a b-c$ is odd; since it is also a power of 2 , we obtain\n\n$$\na b-c=1 \\text {. }\n\\tag{8}\n$$\n\nIf $a=b$, then $c=a^{2}-1$, and from $a c-b=a\\left(a^{2}-2\\right)$ being a power of 2 it follows that both $a$ and $a^{2}-2$ are powers of 2 , whence $a=2$. This gives rise to the solution $(2,2,3)$.\n\n\n\nWe may suppose $a<b$ from now on. As usual, we let $\\alpha>\\beta$ denote the integers satisfying\n\n$$\n2^{\\alpha}=b c-a \\quad \\text { and } \\quad 2^{\\beta}=a c-b\n\\tag{9}\n$$\n\nIf $\\beta=0$ it would follow that $a c-b=a b-c=1$ and hence that $b=c=1$, which is absurd. So $\\beta$ and $\\alpha$ are positive and consequently $a$ and $b$ are even. Substituting $c=a b-1$ into (9) we obtain\n\n$$\n2^{\\alpha}  =a b^{2}-(a+b), \\tag{10}\n$$\n$$\n\\text { and } \\quad 2^{\\beta}  =a^{2} b-(a+b) .\n\\tag{11}\n$$\n\nThe addition of both equation yields $2^{\\alpha}+2^{\\beta}=(a b-2)(a+b)$. Now $a b-2$ is even but not divisible by 4 , so the highest power of 2 dividing $a+b$ is $2^{\\beta-1}$. For this reason, the equations (10) and (11) show that the highest powers of 2 dividing either of the numbers $a b^{2}$ and $a^{2} b$ is likewise $2^{\\beta-1}$. Thus there is an integer $\\tau \\geqslant 1$ together with odd integers $A, B$, and $C$ such that $a=2^{\\tau} A, b=2^{\\tau} B, a+b=2^{3 \\tau} C$, and $\\beta=1+3 \\tau$.\n\nNotice that $A+B=2^{2 \\tau} C \\geqslant 4 C$. Moreover, (11) entails $A^{2} B-C=2$. Thus $8=$ $4 A^{2} B-4 C \\geqslant 4 A^{2} B-A-B \\geqslant A^{2}(3 B-1)$. Since $A$ and $B$ are odd with $A<B$, this is only possible if $A=1$ and $B=3$. Finally, one may conclude $C=1, \\tau=1, a=2, b=6$, and $c=11$. We have thereby found the triple $(2,6,11)$. This completes the discussion of the third case, and hence the solution. There are sixteen such triples, namely $(2,2,2)$, the three permutations of $(2,2,3)$, and the six permutations of each of $(2,6,11)$ and $(3,5,7)$\n']"

#Plan#:

2. **Tighten the Core Condition:** Change the inequality $\operatorname{gcd}(...) \leqslant k$ to a strict *equality* $\operatorname{gcd}(...) = \kappa$, where $\kappa$ depends on $k$. This forces the gcd to be precisely controlled rather than just bounded.
3. **Concretize/Add Constraint on $f$:** Introduce an additional mandatory *numerical constraint* on the function values themselves, independent of the gcd condition but interacting with it. Use a ratio condition $f(p)/f(q) \geq p/q$ to prevent simple linear functions and add nonlinearity.

Note that a $k$-good function is also $(k+1)$-good for any positive integer $k$. Hence, it suffices to show that there does not exist a 1-good function and that there exists a 2-good function.\n\nWe first show that there is no 1-good function. Suppose that there exists a function $f$ such that $G_{f}(m, n)=1$ for all $m \\neq n$. Now, if there are two distinct even numbers $m$ and $n$ such that $f(m)$ and $f(n)$ are both even, then $2 \\mid G_{f}(m, n)$, a contradiction. A similar argument holds if there are two distinct odd numbers $m$ and $n$ such that $f(m)$ and $f(n)$ are both odd. Hence we can choose an even $m$ and an odd $n$ such that $f(m)$ is odd and $f(n)$ is even. This also implies that $2 \\mid G_{f}(m, n)$, a contradiction.\n\nWe now construct a 2 -good function.

First, note that $A+B=2^{g(m)+1}+2^{g(n)+1}-2$ is not divisible by 4 , so that $4 \\nmid \\operatorname{gcd}(A, B)$. Now we suppose that there is an odd prime $p$ for which $p \\mid \\operatorname{gcd}(A, B)$ and derive a contradiction.\n\nWe first claim that $2^{g(m-1)+1} \\geqslant B$. This is a rather weak bound; one way to prove it is as follows. Observe that $g(k+1)>g(k)$ and hence $2^{g(k+1)+1} \\geqslant 2^{g(k)+1}+1$ for every positive integer $k$. By repeatedly applying this inequality, we obtain $2^{g(m-1)+1} \\geqslant 2^{g(n)+1}+(m-1)-n=B$.\n\nNow, since $p \\mid B$, we have $p-1<B \\leqslant 2^{g(m-1)+1}$, so that $p-1 \\mid\\left(2^{g(m-1)+1}\\right) !=g(m)$. Hence $2^{g(m)} \\equiv 1(\\bmod p)$, which yields $A+B \\equiv 2^{g(n)+1}(\\bmod p)$. However, since $p \\mid A+B$, this implies that $p=2$, a contradiction.'

To see that each negative real number $-C$ can be $P(0)$, it suffices to check that for every $C>0$ the polynomial $P(x)=-\\left(\\frac{2 x^{2}}{C}+C\\right)$ has the property described in the statement of the problem. Due to symmetry it is enough for this purpose to prove $\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right|>2|x|$ for any two real numbers $x$ and $y$. In fact we have\n\n$$\n\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right|=y^{2}+\\frac{x^{2}}{C}+\\frac{(|x|-C)^{2}}{C}+2|x| \\geqslant \\frac{x^{2}}{C}+2|x| \\geqslant 2|x|\n$$\n\nwhere in the first estimate equality can only hold if $|x|=C$, whilst in the second one it can only hold if $x=0$. As these two conditions cannot be met at the same time, we have indeed $\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right|>2|x|$.\n\nTo show that $P(0)=1$ is possible as well, we verify that the polynomial $P(x)=x^{2}+1$ satisfies (1). Notice that for all real numbers $x$ and $y$ we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x| & \\Longleftrightarrow\\left(y^{2}-x^{2}-1\\right)^{2} \\leqslant 4 x^{2} \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow 0 \\leqslant\\left(\\left(y^{2}-(x-1)^{2}\\right)\\left((x+1)^{2}-y^{2}\\right)\\right. \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow 0 \\leqslant(y-x+1)(y+x-1)(x+1-y)(x+1+y) \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow 0 \\leqslant\\left((x+y)^{2}-1\\right)\\left(1-(x-y)^{2}\\right) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince this inequality is symmetric in $x$ and $y$, we are done.\n\nPart II. Now we show that no values other than those mentioned in the answer are possible for $P(0)$. To reach this we let $P$ denote any polynomial satisfying (1) and $P(0) \\geqslant 0$; as we shall see, this implies $P(x)=x^{2}+1$ for all real $x$, which is actually more than what we want.\n\nFirst step: We prove that $P$ is even.\n\nBy (1) we have\n\n$$\n\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x| \\Longleftrightarrow\\left|x^{2}-P(y)\\right| \\leqslant 2|y| \\Longleftrightarrow\\left|y^{2}-P(-x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x|\n$$\n\nfor all real numbers $x$ and $y$. Considering just the equivalence of the first and third statement and taking into account that $y^{2}$ may vary through $\\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}$ we infer that\n\n$$\n[P(x)-2|x|, P(x)+2|x|] \\cap \\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}=[P(-x)-2|x|, P(-x)+2|x|] \\cap \\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}\n$$\n\nholds for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We claim that there are infinitely many real numbers $x$ such that $P(x)+2|x| \\geqslant 0$. This holds in fact for any real polynomial with $P(0) \\geqslant 0$; in order to see this, we may assume that the coefficient of $P$ appearing in front of $x$ is nonnegative. In this case the desired inequality holds for all sufficiently small positive real numbers.\n\nFor such numbers $x$ satisfying $P(x)+2|x| \\geqslant 0$ we have $P(x)+2|x|=P(-x)+2|x|$ by the previous displayed formula, and hence also $P(x)=P(-x)$. Consequently the polynomial $P(x)-P(-x)$ has infinitely many zeros, wherefore it has to vanish identically. Thus $P$ is indeed even.\n\n\n\nSecond step: We prove that $P(t)>0$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nLet us assume for a moment that there exists a real number $t \\neq 0$ with $P(t)=0$. Then there is some open interval $I$ around $t$ such that $|P(y)| \\leqslant 2|y|$ holds for all $y \\in I$. Plugging $x=0$ into (1) we learn that $y^{2}=P(0)$ holds for all $y \\in I$, which is clearly absurd. We have thus shown $P(t) \\neq 0$ for all $t \\neq 0$.\n\nIn combination with $P(0) \\geqslant 0$ this informs us that our claim could only fail if $P(0)=0$. In this case there is by our first step a polynomial $Q(x)$ such that $P(x)=x^{2} Q(x)$. Applying (1) to $x=0$ and an arbitrary $y \\neq 0$ we get $|y Q(y)|>2$, which is surely false when $y$ is sufficiently small.\n\nThird step: We prove that $P$ is a quadratic polynomial.\n\nNotice that $P$ cannot be constant, for otherwise if $x=\\sqrt{P(0)}$ and $y$ is sufficiently large, the first part of (1) is false whilst the second part is true. So the degree $n$ of $P$ has to be at least 1 . By our first step $n$ has to be even as well, whence in particular $n \\geqslant 2$.\n\nNow assume that $n \\geqslant 4$. Plugging $y=\\sqrt{P(x)}$ into (1) we get $\\left|x^{2}-P(\\sqrt{P(x)})\\right| \\leqslant 2 \\sqrt{P(x)}$ and hence\n\n$$\nP(\\sqrt{P(x)}) \\leqslant x^{2}+2 \\sqrt{P(x)}\n$$\n\nfor all real $x$. Choose positive real numbers $x_{0}, a$, and $b$ such that if $x \\in\\left(x_{0}, \\infty\\right)$, then $a x^{n}<$ $P(x)<b x^{n}$; this is indeed possible, for if $d>0$ denotes the leading coefficient of $P$, then $\\lim _{x \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{P(x)}{x^{n}}=d$, whence for instance the numbers $a=\\frac{d}{2}$ and $b=2 d$ work provided that $x_{0}$ is chosen large enough.\n\nNow for all sufficiently large real numbers $x$ we have\n\n$$\na^{n / 2+1} x^{n^{2} / 2}<a P(x)^{n / 2}<P(\\sqrt{P(x)}) \\leqslant x^{2}+2 \\sqrt{P(x)}<x^{n / 2}+2 b^{1 / 2} x^{n / 2},\n$$\n\ni.e.\n\n$$\nx^{\\left(n^{2}-n\\right) / 2}<\\frac{1+2 b^{1 / 2}}{a^{n / 2+1}}\n$$\n\nwhich is surely absurd. Thus $P$ is indeed a quadratic polynomial.\n\nFourth step: We prove that $P(x)=x^{2}+1$.\n\nIn the light of our first three steps there are two real numbers $a>0$ and $b$ such that $P(x)=$ $a x^{2}+b$. Now if $x$ is large enough and $y=\\sqrt{a} x$, the left part of (1) holds and the right part reads $\\left|\\left(1-a^{2}\\right) x^{2}-b\\right| \\leqslant 2 \\sqrt{a} x$. In view of the fact that $a>0$ this is only possible if $a=1$. Finally, substituting $y=x+1$ with $x>0$ into (1) we get\n\n$$\n|2 x+1-b| \\leqslant 2 x \\Longleftrightarrow|2 x+1+b| \\leqslant 2 x+2,\n$$\n\ni.e.,\n\n$$\nb \\in[1,4 x+1] \\Longleftrightarrow b \\in[-4 x-3,1]\n$$\n\nfor all $x>0$. Choosing $x$ large enough, we can achieve that at least one of these two statements holds; then both hold, which is only possible if $b=1$, as desired.']"

We are given an infinite deck of cards, each with a unique real number. Two players draw disjoint sets \(A\) and \(B\) of \(k\) cards each, for a fixed positive integer \(k\). We must define a rule to declare a winner based solely on the relative order of the \(2k\) cards, not their numerical values. The rule must satisfy:  
1. The winner depends only on the positions in increasing order and which cards belong to each player.  
2. If sorted sequences satisfy \(a_i > b_i\) for all \(i\), then \(A\) beats \(B\).  
3. The outcome remains identical if all numerical values are negated (relative order preserved but direction reversed).  
4. For any \(n \geq 2\) and disjoint sets \(A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n\) of size \(k\), if \(A_1\) beats \(A_2\), \(A_2\) beats \(A_3\), \ldots, and \(A_{n-1}\) beats \(A_n\) pairwise, then \(A_1\) beats \(A_n\).  
How many such rules exist for a given \(k\)? Rules are different if they disagree on the winner for some disjoint sets \(A\) and \(B\) of size \(k\).",success,139.42,"['We prove a more general statement for sets of cardinality $n$ (the problem being the special case $n=100$, then the answer is $n$ ). In the following, we write $A>B$ or $B<A$ for "" $A$ beats $B$ "".\n\nPart I. Let us first define $n$ different rules that satisfy the conditions. To this end, fix an index $k \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$. We write both $A$ and $B$ in increasing order as $A=\\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right\\}$ and $B=\\left\\{b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$ and say that $A$ beats $B$ if and only if $a_{k}>b_{k}$. This rule clearly satisfies all three conditions, and the rules corresponding to different $k$ are all different. Thus there are at least $n$ different rules.\n\nPart II. Now we have to prove that there is no other way to define such a rule. Suppose that our rule satisfies the conditions, and let $k \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ be minimal with the property that\n\n$$\nA_{k}=\\{1,2, \\ldots, k, n+k+1, n+k+2, \\ldots, 2 n\\} \\prec B_{k}=\\{k+1, k+2, \\ldots, n+k\\} .\n$$\n\nClearly, such a $k$ exists, since this holds for $k=n$ by assumption. Now consider two disjoint sets $X=\\left\\{x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right\\}$ and $Y=\\left\\{y_{1}, y_{2}, \\ldots, y_{n}\\right\\}$, both in increasing order (i.e., $x_{1}<x_{2}<\\cdots<x_{n}$ and $y_{1}<y_{2}<\\cdots<y_{n}$ ). We claim that $X<Y$ if (and only if - this follows automatically) $x_{k}<y_{k}$.\n\nTo prove this statement, pick arbitrary real numbers $u_{i}, v_{i}, w_{i} \\notin X \\cup Y$ such that\n\n$$\nu_{1}<u_{2}<\\cdots<u_{k-1}<\\min \\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right), \\quad \\max \\left(x_{n}, y_{n}\\right)<v_{k+1}<v_{k+2}<\\cdots<v_{n},\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nx_{k}<v_{1}<v_{2}<\\cdots<v_{k}<w_{1}<w_{2}<\\cdots<w_{n}<u_{k}<u_{k+1}<\\cdots<u_{n}<y_{k},\n$$\n\nand set\n\n$$\nU=\\left\\{u_{1}, u_{2}, \\ldots, u_{n}\\right\\}, V=\\left\\{v_{1}, v_{2}, \\ldots, v_{n}\\right\\}, W=\\left\\{w_{1}, w_{2}, \\ldots, w_{n}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThen\n\n- $u_{i}<y_{i}$ and $x_{i}<v_{i}$ for all $i$, so $U<Y$ and $X<V$ by the second condition.\n\n\n\n- The elements of $U \\cup W$ are ordered in the same way as those of $A_{k-1} \\cup B_{k-1}$, and since $A_{k-1}>B_{k-1}$ by our choice of $k$, we also have $U>W$ (if $k=1$, this is trivial).\n- The elements of $V \\cup W$ are ordered in the same way as those of $A_{k} \\cup B_{k}$, and since $A_{k} \\prec B_{k}$ by our choice of $k$, we also have $V<W$.\n\nIt follows that\n\n$$\nX<V<W<U<Y\n$$\n\nso $X<Y$ by the third condition, which is what we wanted to prove.'
 'Another possible approach to Part II of this problem is induction on $n$. For $n=1$, there is trivially only one rule in view of the second condition.\n\nIn the following, we assume that our claim (namely, that there are no possible rules other than those given in Part I) holds for $n-1$ in place of $n$. We start with the following observation: Claim. At least one of the two relations\n\n$$\n(\\{2\\} \\cup\\{2 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\})<(\\{1\\} \\cup\\{2 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\})\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n(\\{2 i-1 \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n\\})<(\\{2 i \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n-1\\})\n$$\n\nholds.\n\nProof. Suppose that the first relation does not hold. Since our rule may only depend on the relative order, we must also have\n\n$$\n(\\{2\\} \\cup\\{3 i-2 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n-2\\})>(\\{1\\} \\cup\\{3 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n\\}) .\n$$\n\nLikewise, if the second relation does not hold, then we must also have\n\n$$\n(\\{1\\} \\cup\\{3 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n\\})>(\\{3\\} \\cup\\{3 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n-1\\}) .\n$$\n\nNow condition 3 implies that\n\n$$\n(\\{2\\} \\cup\\{3 i-2 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n-2\\})>(\\{3\\} \\cup\\{3 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n-1\\}),\n$$\n\nwhich contradicts the second condition.\n\nNow we distinguish two cases, depending on which of the two relations actually holds:\n\nFirst case: $(\\{2\\} \\cup\\{2 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\})<(\\{1\\} \\cup\\{2 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\})$.\n\nLet $A=\\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right\\}$ and $B=\\left\\{b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$ be two disjoint sets, both in increasing order. We claim that the winner can be decided only from the values of $a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}$, while $a_{1}$ and $b_{1}$ are actually irrelevant. Suppose that this was not the case, and assume without loss of generality that $a_{2}<b_{2}$. Then the relative order of $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}$ is fixed, and the position of $b_{1}$ has to decide the winner. Suppose that for some value $b_{1}=x, B$ wins, while for some other value $b_{1}=y, A$ wins.\n\nWrite $B_{x}=\\left\\{x, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$ and $B_{y}=\\left\\{y, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$, and let $\\varepsilon>0$ be smaller than half the distance between any two of the numbers in $B_{x} \\cup B_{y} \\cup A$. For any set $M$, let $M \\pm \\varepsilon$ be the set obtained by adding/subtracting $\\varepsilon$ to all elements of $M$. By our choice of $\\varepsilon$, the relative order of the elements of $\\left(B_{y}+\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup A$ is still the same as for $B_{y} \\cup A$, while the relative order of the elements of $\\left(B_{x}-\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup A$ is still the same as for $B_{x} \\cup A$. Thus $A<B_{x}-\\varepsilon$, but $A>B_{y}+\\varepsilon$. Moreover, if $y>x$, then $B_{x}-\\varepsilon \\prec B_{y}+\\varepsilon$ by condition 2, while otherwise the relative order of\n\n\n\nthe elements in $\\left(B_{x}-\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup\\left(B_{y}+\\varepsilon\\right)$ is the same as for the two sets $\\{2\\} \\cup\\{2 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\}$ and $\\{1\\} \\cup\\{2 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\}$, so that $B_{x}-\\varepsilon<B_{y}+\\varepsilon$. In either case, we obtain\n\n$$\nA \\prec B_{x}-\\varepsilon \\prec B_{y}+\\varepsilon<A,\n$$\n\nwhich contradicts condition 3 .\n\nSo we know now that the winner does not depend on $a_{1}, b_{1}$. Therefore, we can define a new rule $<^{*}$ on sets of cardinality $n-1$ by saying that $A \\prec^{*} B$ if and only if $A \\cup\\{a\\} \\prec B \\cup\\{b\\}$ for some $a, b$ (or equivalently, all $a, b$ ) such that $a<\\min A, b<\\min B$ and $A \\cup\\{a\\}$ and $B \\cup\\{b\\}$ are disjoint. The rule $<^{*}$ satisfies all conditions again, so by the induction hypothesis, there exists an index $i$ such that $A \\prec^{*} B$ if and only if the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $A$ is less than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $B$. This implies that $C<D$ if and only if the $(i+1)^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $C$ is less than the $(i+1)^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $D$, which completes our induction.\n\nSecond case: $(\\{2 i-1 \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n\\})<(\\{2 i \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n-1\\})$. Set $-A=\\{-a \\mid a \\in A\\}$ for any $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$. For any two disjoint sets $A, B \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ of cardinality $n$, we write $A \\prec^{\\circ} B$ to mean $(-B) \\prec(-A)$. It is easy to see that $\\prec^{\\circ}$ defines a rule to determine a winner that satisfies the three conditions of our problem as well as the relation of the first case. So it follows in the same way as in the first case that for some $i, A \\prec^{\\circ} B$ if and only if the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $A$ is less than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $B$, which is equivalent to the condition that the $i^{\\text {th }}$ largest element of $-A$ is greater than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ largest element of $-B$. This proves that the original rule $<$ also has the desired form.']"

Step 2
**#Plan#:**
1.  **Manipulate Set Definition (Exponent Range):** Modify the exponent range defining the set to depend on $n$ in a non-trivial way, moving beyond the simple $[0, n)$. This introduces complexity based on $n$'s properties.
2.  **Add a Constraint to Representations:** Introduce a representation requirement beyond simple summation, such as satisfying a specified congruence condition modulo a function of $n$. This adds a modular arithmetic layer.
3.  **Introduce Multiplicity Constraints:** Restrict the count of times elements can appear in the sum using a variable bound (a linear function of $n$), increasing complexity without adding uncontrolled variables.
4.  **Ensure Coherence:** The modulus and multiplicity bound are chosen as functions of $n$ (specifically $2^n$ and $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$) to maintain intrinsic connection to the set's structure and theme. All modified elements interact to make the representability problem distinctly harder.

#Elements Identified#:
- **Variables**: \( k \) is a given integer parameter controlling the number of elements in each sum.
- **Set constraints**: The set must have distinct real numbers; this can be restricted to integers or specified positivity to add constraints.
- **Sum condition**: Each element must be expressible as a sum of exactly \( k \) other distinct elements; this can be extended to require multiple distinct representations.
- **Objective**: Find the smallest \( n \) such that such a set exists, with \( n \geq k+1 \); this can depend on additional parameters.
- **Theme**: Combines combinatorial set existence with additive properties; complexity can be increased by introducing more variables, discrete constraints, or multiplicity requirements.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. Introduce a new integer parameter \( t \geq 1 \) to require that each element has at least \( t \) distinct representations as a sum of \( k \) other elements. This adds variability to the condition.
2. Constrain the set elements to be positive integers instead of real numbers, introducing discrete number-theoretic challenges and eliminating trivial real-number solutions.
3. Modify the sum condition to explicitly involve distinct subsets, ensuring the ""ways"" are unambiguously defined as different combinations of elements.
4. Maintain interdependence: The smallest \( n \) now depends on both \( k \) and \( t \), significantly increasing reasoning complexity while keeping the original theme.

Step 2
**#Plan#:**
1.  **Introduce Parameterization:** Replace the constant `2` with a positive real parameter `K`. This increases generality and requires handling a variable constant.
2.  **Add Functional Constraint:** Impose the involutive property `f(f(y)) = y`, deeply binding `y` to the function behavior and introducing symmetry/non-linearity.
3.  **Concretize Uniqueness via Minimization:** Replace the uniqueness constraint with the stronger condition that `y` minimizes the expression `x f(z) + z f(x)` over all `z > 0`. This inherently implies uniqueness (of the minimizer for each `x`) and significantly increases analytical depth.

If $(x, y)$ is good, then $x=y$.\n\nProof. Assume that there exist positive real numbers $x \\neq y$ such that $(x, y)$ is good. The uniqueness assumption says that $y$ is the unique positive real number such that $(x, y)$ is good. In particular, $(x, x)$ is not a good pair.

Fix a value of $x$ and note that for $y>x$ we must have $x f(x)+y f(x)>x f(y)+y f(x)>2$ (using that $f$ is decreasing for the first step), hence $f(x)>\\frac{2}{x+y}$.

 'As in the first solution, we note that $f(x)=1 / x$ is a solution, and we set out to prove that it is the only one. We write $g(x)$ for the unique positive real number such that $(x, g(x))$ is a good pair. In this solution, we prove Lemma 2 without assuming Lemma 1.\n\nLemma 2. The function $f$ is decreasing.\n\nProof. Consider $x<y$. It holds that $y f(g(y))+g(y) f(y) \\leqslant 2$. Moreover, because $y$ is the only positive real number such that $(g(y), y)$ is a good pair and $x \\neq y$, we have $x f(g(y))+g(y) f(x)>$ 2.

Because $g(y)$ and $f(g(y))$ are both positive while $x-y$ is negative, it follows that $f(y)<f(x)$, showing that $f$ is decreasing.\n\nWe now prove Lemma 1 using Lemma 2. Suppose that $x \\neq y$ but $x f(y)+y f(x) \\leqslant 2$. As in the first solution, we get $x f(x)+x f(x)>2$ and $y f(y)+y f(y)>2$, which implies $x f(x)+y f(y)>2$. Now\n\n$$\nx f(x)+y f(y)>2 \\geqslant x f(y)+y f(x)\n$$\n\nimplies $(x-y)(f(x)-f(y))>0$, which contradicts the fact that $f$ is decreasing.

The lumberjack may therefore cut those trees, ensuring no tree on a non-coloured square has positive height after his turn. Hence there cannot ever be more majestic trees than coloured squares, which is $5 N^{2}$.\n\nNext, we prove the gardener may ensure there are $5 N^{2}$ majestic trees. In fact, we prove this statement in a modified game which is more difficult for the gardener: on the lumberjack's turn in the modified game, he may decrement the height of all trees on the board except those the gardener did not just grow, in addition to four of the trees the gardener just grew. Clearly, a sequence of moves for the gardener which ensures that there are $K$ majestic trees in the modified game also ensures this in the original game.\n\n\n\nLet $M=\\left(\\begin{array}{l}9 \\\\ 5\\end{array}\\right)$; we say that a $m a p$ is one of the $M$ possible ways to mark 5 squares on a $3 \\times 3$ board.

Also note that if the gardener chooses a $3 \\times 3$ subboard $M l$ times, the lumberjack will have to choose some map at least $l$ times, so there will be at least 5 trees which each have height $\\geqslant l$.\n\nThe strategy for the gardener will be to divide the board into $N^{2}$ disjoint $3 \\times 3$ subboards, number them $0, \\ldots, N^{2}-1$ in some order. Then, for $b=N^{2}-1, \\ldots, 0$ in order, he plays $10^{6} M(M+1)^{b}$ times on subboard number $b$. Hence, on subboard number $b$, the moves on that subboard will first ensure 5 of its trees grows by at least $10^{6}(M+1)^{b}$, and then each move after that will decrease their heights by 1 . (As the trees on subboard $b$ had height 0 before the gardener started playing there, no move made on subboards $\\geqslant b$ decreased their heights.) As the gardener makes $10^{6} M(M+1)^{b-1}+\\ldots=10^{6}\\left((M+1)^{b}-1\\right)$ moves after he finishes playing on subboard $b$, this means that on subboard $b$, there will be 5 trees of height at least $10^{6}(M+1)^{b}-10^{6}\\left((M+1)^{b}-1\\right)=10^{6}$, hence each of the subboard has 5 majestic trees, which was what we wanted.""]"

#Elements Identified#:
*   **Board:** $n \times n$ grid.
*   **Values:** Distinct integers $1$ to $n^2$, assigned by Alice.
*   **Adjacency:** Defined as sharing a common side (4-directional).
*   **Good Path:**
    *   Starts only at cells where *all* adjacent cells have larger numbers.
    *   Each subsequent cell is adjacent to the previous.
    *   Numbers on the path are strictly increasing.
*   **Goal:** Minimize the *total count* of all such valid good paths (any length $\geq 1$) for Alice's assignment.
*   **Theme:** Path counting constrained by neighbor comparisons and order, minimized over assignments.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Increase Constraints on Path Formation:** Replace simple adjacency (4-way) with 8-way adjacency (queen-move adjacency, including diagonals). This drastically increases potential connections and interactions.
2.  **Introduce Additional Agents/Constraints:** Introduce a second player, Bob, who *also* fills an identical board independently. They are opponents; each seeks to minimize their own path count. For Bob's board to be valid, Alice's assignment must be used.
3.  **Add Mutual Constraint & Concretize Goal:** Introduce parameters $k$ (min length for Alice) and $l$ (min length for Bob), making the path count target specific long paths. Add a high-stakes mutual constraint: Alice's *longest possible* good path must be *strictly shorter* than Bob's *shortest possible good path* (after both assignments are fixed). The goal shifts to designing both assignments to satisfy this constraint while minimizing Alice's count of good paths *of length at least $k$*.
4.  **Enhance Complexity:** These elements are linked: 8-way adjacency makes path behaviors much more complex and tightly couples cells, existence of valid long paths for both players with a strict ordering of their extrema is a strong global constraint, and minimizing Alice's count under her path length threshold $k$ (while satisfying the strict extrema difference across both boards) requires intricate interplay between the two assignments. The concrete variables $k, l$ ($k, l \leq n^2$) replace the vague ""arbitrary length"".

Step 3
#Rewritten Instruction#:
Alice and Bob each fill a separate $n \times n$ board (its cells marked by queen-adjacent neighbors) with numbers $1$ to $n^2$, using each once. Alice must assign her numbers to Bob's cells. Alice counts paths starting on cells with all larger neighbors. Bob's paths start similarly. Any path moves to an adjacent cell with a larger number. Alice minimizes her good paths (length $\geq k$) counting, constrained by Bob having any valid assignment where her assignment fits his cells. For such assignments, Alice's longest good path must be shorter than Bob's shortest good path of length $\geq l$. Find minimal count Alice achieves.

Find this minimal number, as a function of $n, k, l$.",success,21.87,"['We will call any field that is only adjacent to fields with larger numbers a well. Other fields will be called non-wells. Let us make a second $n \\times n$ board $B$ where in each field we will write the number of good sequences which end on the corresponding field in the original board $A$. We will thus look for the minimal possible value of the sum of all entries in $B$.\n\nWe note that any well has just one good path ending in it, consisting of just the well, and that any other field has the number of good paths ending in it equal to the sum of this quantity for all the adjacent fields with smaller values, since a good path can only come into the field from a field of lower value. Therefore, if we fill in the fields in $B$ in increasing order with respect to their values in $A$, it follows that each field not adjacent to any already filled field will receive a 1, while each field adjacent to already filled fields will receive the sum of the numbers already written on these adjacent fields.\n\nWe note that there is at least one well in $A$, that corresponding with the field with the entry 1 in $A$. Hence, the sum of values of fields in $B$ corresponding to wells in $A$ is at least 1 . We will now try to minimize the sum of the non-well entries, i.e. of the entries in $B$ corresponding to the non-wells in $A$. We note that we can ascribe to each pair of adjacent fields the value of the lower assigned number and that the sum of non-well entries will then equal to the sum of the ascribed numbers. Since the lower number is still at least 1, the sum of non-well entries will at least equal the number of pairs of adjacent fields, which is $2 n(n-1)$. Hence, the total minimum sum of entries in $B$ is at least $2 n(n-1)+1=2 n^{2}-2 n+1$. The necessary conditions for the minimum to be achieved is for there to be only one well and for no two entries in $B$ larger than 1 to be adjacent to each other.\n\nWe will now prove that the lower limit of $2 n^{2}-2 n+1$ entries can be achieved. This amounts to finding a way of marking a certain set of squares, those that have a value of 1 in $B$, such that no two unmarked squares are adjacent and that the marked squares form a connected tree with respect to adjacency.\n\nFor $n=1$ and $n=2$ the markings are respectively the lone field and the L-trimino. Now, for $n>2$, let $s=2$ for $n \\equiv 0,2 \\bmod 3$ and $s=1$ for $n \\equiv 1 \\bmod 3$. We will take indices $k$ and $l$ to be arbitrary non-negative integers. For $n \\geqslant 3$ we will construct a path of marked squares in the first two columns consisting of all squares of the form $(1, i)$ where $i$ is not of the form $6 k+s$ and $(2, j)$ where $j$ is of the form $6 k+s-1,6 k+s$ or $6+s+1$. Obviously, this path is connected. Now, let us consider the fields $(2,6 k+s)$ and $(1,6 k+s+3)$. For each considered field $(i, j)$ we will mark all squares of the form $(l, j)$ for $l>i$ and $(i+2 k, j \\pm 1)$. One can easily see that no set of marked fields will produce a cycle, that the only fields of the unmarked form $(1,6 k+s),(2+2 l+1,6 k+s \\pm 1)$ and $(2+2 l, 6 k+s+3 \\pm 1)$ and that no two are adjacent, since\n\n\n\nthe consecutive considered fields are in columns of opposite parity.

(Since needles are closed under scalar multiples and quotients, this is well-defined.)\n\nClaim. Grades are closed upwards.\n\nProof. Consider positive rationals $k_{1} / l_{1}<k_{2} / l_{2}$ with $k_{1} / l_{1}$ a grade. Then:\n\n- $\\left(k_{1}, l_{1}\\right)$ is a needle\n- so $\\left(k_{1} l_{2}, l_{1} l_{2}\\right)$ is a needle,\n- so $\\left(k_{2} l_{1}, l_{1} l_{2}\\right)$ is a needle (as $k_{2} l_{1}-k_{1} l_{2}>0$ and $(1,0)$ is a needle).\n\nThus $\\left(k_{2}, l_{2}\\right)$ is a needle, as wanted.\n\nClaim. A grade exists.\n\nProof. If no positive integer $n$ is a grade, then $f(1,0)>f(0, n)$ for all $n$ which is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, there is an $n$ such that $f(0,1)<f(n, 0)$, thus $1 / n$ is not a grade for some large $n$. That means that small positive rational values are not grades, then there is a switch, and after that all values are grades. Call the place of that switch $\\alpha$. Here $\\alpha$ is the infimum of the grades.\n\nClaim (Key property). If $x_{1}+y_{1} \\alpha>x_{2}+y_{2} \\alpha$ then $f\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)>f\\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\\right)$.\n\nProof.

This gives $f\\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\\right)<f\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$.\n\nFrom those observations we get the following claim.\n\nClaim. The function $f$ orders pairs $(x, y)$ based on the value of $x+y \\alpha$. If $\\alpha$ is rational, tiebreaking is done by larger $x$ - or $y$-coordinate (depending on whether $\\alpha$ is a grade).\n\n\n\nWe can imagine this the following way: take a line with slope $-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}$ under the first quadrant of the plane. And we start to move this line upward (but it stays parallel to the original line). First it hits $(0,0)$, so $f(0,0)=0$. And each time the line hits a point $p, f(p)$ is the number of points hit before. If $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, it is possible that the line hits multiple points.

This introduces complexity through a nested sum dependent on the range defined by the prime pair. Note that for true twin primes (`q=p+2`), there are *no primes* between `p` and `q`, so this sum would be 0. To avoid triviality and ensure the product is non-zero and divisible only when `n` is sufficiently large relative to the pairs considered, use `1 + ∑_{r prime, p < r < q} r`, which equals `1` whenever no primes exist between `p` and `q`.
3.  **Add a Modular Constraint on `n`:** Introduce an **additional arithmetic constraint** on `n`, specifically requiring `n ≡ 3 mod 4`, which interacts subtly with the properties of sums of primes and factorials.
4.  **Ensure Coherence:** These modifications work together logically:
    *   The core remains factorial (`n!`) divisibility (`|`) of a product over prime pairs near `n`.
    *   The product now consists of terms `(p + q) * (1 + ∑_{p < r < q} r)` specifically for *twin prime pairs* `(p, q)`.
    *   The added modular condition, `n ≡ 3 mod 4`, necessitates checking divisibility only for a specific residue class of `n`.

Potential areas for complexity: Expand domain to include non-positive rationals, generalize exponents or involve additional variables, add functional constraints like surjectivity, or introduce real-world dependencies (here, amplified mathematical complexity through multiple variables and broader domains).  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
1. Expand domain to include all rational numbers (including zero and negatives) but maintain codomain as positive rationals. This introduces boundary cases (e.g., $x=0$ or $y=0$), negative inputs affecting squares, and requires consistent behavior.  
2. Introduce a third variable $z$ into the functional equation to create interdependence, increasing the number of cases and symmetry considerations. Specifically, modify the equation to $f\left( x^{2} f(y)^{2} z^{2} \right) = f(x)^{2} f(y) f(z)^{2}$ for all $x,y,z$, adding complexity due to the additional degrees of freedom.  
3. Add constraint that $f$ is surjective onto $\mathbb{Q}_{>0}$. This ensures non-trivial solutions, excludes constant functions (e.g., if constant, surjectivity fails), and demands reasoning about range.  
All elements interconnect: The expanded domain impacts equation evaluation at critical points (e.g., zero), the multi-variable equation necessitates investigating symmetry or substitution strategies, and surjectivity provides a tool for deducing function forms.

In the sequel, we assume that $k<n-1$.\n\nNow the first inequality in (1) rewrites as $n S(n, k) \\geqslant k S(n, n)=k(S(n, k)+S(n-k, n-k))$, or, cancelling the terms occurring on both parts, as\n\n$$\n(n-k) S(n, k) \\geqslant k S(n-k, n-k) \\Longleftrightarrow S(n, k) \\geqslant k \\cdot \\frac{S(n-k, n-k)}{n-k}\n$$\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, we have $S(n-k, n-k) /(n-k)=m_{n-k}$. By Claim 3, we get $a_{n-i} \\geqslant m_{n-k}$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, k$. Summing these $k$ inequalities we obtain\n\n$$\nS(n, k) \\geqslant k m_{n-k}=k \\cdot \\frac{S(n-k, n-k)}{n-k}\n$$\n\nas required.\n\nThe second inequality in (1) is proved similarly. Indeed, this inequality is equivalent to\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n(n-1) S(n, k) \\leqslant k S(n, n-1) & \\Longleftrightarrow(n-k-1) S(n, k) \\leqslant k S(n-k, n-k-1) \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow S(n, k) \\leqslant k \\cdot \\frac{S(n-k, n-k-1)}{n-k-1}=k M_{n-k} ;\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nthe last inequality follows again from Claim 3, as each term in $S(n, k)$ is at most $M_{n-k}$.\n\nNow we can prove the required estimate for $a_{2018}-a_{2017}$. Set $N=2017$. By Claim 4 ,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{N+1}-a_{N} \\leqslant M_{N+1}-a_{N}=\\frac{S(N+1, N)}{N}-a_{N} & =\\frac{a_{N}+S(N, N-1)}{N}-a_{N} \\\\\n& =\\frac{S(N, N-1)}{N}-\\frac{N-1}{N} \\cdot a_{N} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, the same Claim yields\n\n$$\na_{N} \\geqslant m_{N}=\\frac{S(N, N)}{N}=\\frac{S(N, N-1)}{N}\n$$\n\nNoticing that each term in $S(N, N-1)$ is at most 1 , so $S(N, N-1) \\leqslant N-1$, we finally obtain\n\n$$\na_{N+1}-a_{N} \\leqslant \\frac{S(N, N-1)}{N}-\\frac{N-1}{N} \\cdot \\frac{S(N, N-1)}{N}=\\frac{S(N, N-1)}{N^{2}} \\leqslant \\frac{N-1}{N^{2}} .\n$$']"

**#Elements Identified#:**
- **Board**: Fixed $20 \times 20$ chessboard, initially empty.
- **Players**: Horst (places black knights) and Queenie (places white queens).
- **Turn Structure**: Sequential, alternating moves starting with Horst.
- **Horst's Constraint**: Places a knight on an empty square without attacking existing knights.
- **Queenie's Action**: Places a queen on any empty square without restrictions.
- **Termination Condition**: Game ends when a player cannot make a move.
- **Objective**: Find maximal $K$ such that Horst guarantees at least $K$ knights against any Queenie strategy.
- **Key Theme**: Adversarial placement under independence constraints for knights, with queens as blockers.

Step 2    
**#Plan#:**
1. **Increase Dimensionality**: Generalize the $20 \times 20$ chessboard to an $n \times n$ board where $n \geq 4$ is even (to introduce parameterization and parity considerations).
2. **Add Constraints to Horst's Moves**: Require knights to avoid squares attacked by *existing queens* (beyond knight independence), increasing placement complexity due to queen threats.
3. **Impose Obligations on Queenie**: Force Queenie’s queen placement to attack at least one knight if possible (making Queenie proactively aggressive), with a fallback to free placement only when impossible.
4. **Refine Objective**: Express the goal as a function $K(n)$, requiring asymptotic or parameter-dependent analysis instead of a fixed number.
5. **Ensure Coherence**: Maintain core mechanics (alternating turns, independence for knights) while logically linking new constraints (queen threats affect knight placements, aggressive queen moves alter board dynamics).

Notice that in a $4 \\times 4$ board the squares can be grouped into 4 cycles of length 4 , as shown in Figure 1.

 ""Consider any tournament schedule. Label players $P_{1}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{2 k}$ in order of their arrival, and label them again $Q_{2 k}, Q_{2 k-1}, \\ldots, Q_{1}$ in order of their departure, to define a permutation $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{2 k}$ of $1,2, \\ldots, 2 k$ by $P_{i}=Q_{a_{i}}$.\n\nWe first describe an optimal tournament for any given permutation $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{2 k}$ of the indices $1,2, \\ldots, 2 k$. Next, we find an optimal permutation and an optimal tournament.\n\nOptimisation for a fixed $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 k}$. We say that the cost of the match between $P_{i}$ and $P_{j}$ is the number of players present at the tournament when this match is played. Clearly, the Committee pays for each day the cost of the match of that day. Hence, we are to minimise the total cost of all matches.\n\nNotice that $Q_{2 k}$ 's departure does not precede $P_{2 k}$ 's arrival. Hence, the number of players at the tournament monotonically increases (non-strictly) until it reaches $2 k$, and then monotonically decreases (non-strictly). So, the best time to schedule the match between $P_{i}$ and $P_{j}$ is either when $P_{\\max (i, j)}$ arrives, or when $Q_{\\max \\left(a_{i}, a_{j}\\right)}$ departs, in which case the cost is $\\min \\left(\\max (i, j), \\max \\left(a_{i}, a_{j}\\right)\\right)$.\n\nConversely, assuming that $i>j$, if this match is scheduled between the arrivals of $P_{i}$ and $P_{i+1}$, then its cost will be exactly $i=\\max (i, j)$. Similarly, one can make it cost $\\max \\left(a_{i}, a_{j}\\right)$.

1. Change the circle to an ellipse: Replace $\omega$ with an ellipse of semi-major axis $\lambda$ and semi-minor axis 1 (with $\lambda \geq 1$ fixed). This generalizes the problem, requiring analysis of asymmetric geometry.  
2. Add a convexity constraint: Mandate that every vertex of each triangle lies on the ellipse, and each triangle is strictly convex to avoid degeneracy. This ensures all triangles are ""well-behaved"" and increases geometric complexity.  
3. Introduce $\lambda$ as a parameter: Include $\lambda$ in the problem statement, making $t$ depend on $\lambda$. The solution must now address how $t$ varies with $\lambda$.

From an $A$-cell the rook has to move to a $B$-cell or a $C$-cell. In the first case, the order of the colors of the cells visited is given by $A, B, D, C, A, B, D, C, A, \\ldots$, in the second case it is $A, C, D, B, A, C, D, B, A, \\ldots$ Since the route is closed it must contain the same number of cells of each color.

Color the $A$-cells in black and white in a chessboard manner, i.e. color any two $A$-cells at distance 2 in different color. Since the number of $A$-cells is odd the rook cannot always alternate between visiting black and white $A$-cells along its route. Hence there are two $A$-cells of the same color which are four rook-steps apart that are visited directly one after the other. Let these two $A$-cells have row and column numbers $(a, b)$ and $(a+2, b+2)$ respectively.\n\n<img_3906>\n\nThere is up to reflection only one way the rook can take from $(a, b)$ to $(a+2, b+2)$. Let this way be $(a, b) \\rightarrow(a, b+1) \\rightarrow(a+1, b+1) \\rightarrow(a+1, b+2) \\rightarrow(a+2, b+2)$. Also let without loss of generality the color of the cell $(a, b+1)$ be $B$ (otherwise change the roles of columns and rows).\n\nNow consider the $A$-cell $(a, b+2)$. The only way the rook can pass through it is via $(a-1, b+2) \\rightarrow$ $(a, b+2) \\rightarrow(a, b+3)$ in this order, since according to our assumption after every $A$-cell the rook passes through a $B$-cell.

This is due to the following fact:\n\nThe path from $(a, b)$ to $(a, b+3)$ together with the line segment joining these two cells form a closed loop that has one of the cells $(a-1, b+2)$ and $(a+2, b+2)$ in its inside and the other one on the outside.

Since $K$ and $I$ lie on the angle bisector of $\\angle A C D$, the segments $I D$ and $I F$ are symmetric with respect to the line $I C$. Hence there is a point $S$ on $I F$ where the incircle of triangle $A D C$ touches the segment $I F$. Then segments $K P, K Q, K R$ and $K S$ all have the same length and are perpendicular to $A D, D C, C A$ and $I F$, respectively. So - regardless of the value of $\\angle B E K$ - the quadrilateral $K R F S$ is a square and $\\angle S F K=\\angle K F C=45^{\\circ}$.\n\nConsider the case $\\angle B A C=60^{\\circ}$ (see Figure 1). Then triangle $A B C$ is equilateral. Furthermore we have $F=E$, hence $\\angle B E K=\\angle I F K=\\angle S E K=45^{\\circ}$. So $60^{\\circ}$ is a possible value for $\\angle B A C$.\n\nNow consider the case $\\angle B A C=90^{\\circ}$ (see Figure 2). Then $\\angle C B A=\\angle A C B=45^{\\circ}$. Furthermore, $\\angle K I E=\\frac{1}{2} \\angle C B A+\\frac{1}{2} \\angle A C B=45^{\\circ}, \\angle A E B=180^{\\circ}-90^{\\circ}-22.5^{\\circ}=67.5^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle E I A=\\angle B I D=180^{\\circ}-90^{\\circ}-22.5^{\\circ}=67.5^{\\circ}$. Hence triangle $I E A$ is isosceles and a reflection of the bisector of $\\angle I A E$ takes $I$ to $E$ and $K$ to itself. So triangle $I K E$ is symmetric with respect to this axis, i.e. $\\angle K I E=\\angle I E K=\\angle B E K=45^{\\circ}$. So $90^{\\circ}$ is a possible value for $\\angle B A C$, too.\n\nIf, on the other hand, $\\angle B E K=45^{\\circ}$ then $\\angle B E K=\\angle I E K=\\angle I F K=45^{\\circ}$. Then\n\n- either $F=E$, which makes the angle bisector $B I$ be an altitude, i.e., which makes triangle $A B C$ isosceles with base $A C$ and hence equilateral and so $\\angle B A C=60^{\\circ}$,\n- or $E$ lies between $F$ and $C$, which makes the points $K, E, F$ and $I$ concyclic, so $45^{\\circ}=$ $\\angle K F C=\\angle K F E=\\angle K I E=\\angle C B I+\\angle I C B=2 \\cdot \\angle I C B=90^{\\circ}-\\frac{1}{2} \\angle B A C$, and so $\\angle B A C=90^{\\circ}$,\n\n\n\n- or $F$ lies between $E$ and $C$, then again, $K, E, F$ and $I$ are concyclic, so $45^{\\circ}=\\angle K F C=$ $180^{\\circ}-\\angle K F E=\\angle K I E$, which yields the same result $\\angle B A C=90^{\\circ}$. (However, for $\\angle B A C=90^{\\circ} E$ lies, in fact, between $F$ and $C$, see Figure 2.

Since $K$ is the incenter of triangle $A D C$, we have $\\angle C D K=\\angle K D A=45^{\\circ}$; furthermore $\\angle D I C=45^{\\circ}+\\frac{\\alpha}{4}$.

Replace the single-variable recurrence with a coupled system involving two sequences \(a_k\) and \(b_k\), increasing complexity and reasoning steps. The new recurrence should maintain a rational form involving squares and constants.
2.  **Add Constraints on Boundaries:** Impose significant constraints on both the start *and* the end of the sequence, removing the implicit freedom of \(a_1\), \(a_2\), and \(a_n\), requiring them to satisfy specific prime conditions.
3.  **Add Global Constraint:** Introduce a requirement that the sequence must be *minimal* in a specific way (e.g., smallest possible largest term) among sequences of that length satisfying the other conditions, adding an extremal component.

Similarly we must have $a_{4}$ odd as well. But then $a_{3}^{2}+1$ is a product of two even numbers $\\left(a_{2}+1\\right)\\left(a_{4}+1\\right)$ and thus is divisible by 4 , which is a contradiction as for odd $a_{3}$ we have $a_{3}^{2}+1 \\equiv 2 \\bmod 4$.\n\nHence $a_{2}$ is even. Furthermore $a_{3}+1$ divides the odd number $a_{2}^{2}+1$ and so $a_{3}$ is even. Similarly, $a_{4}$ and $a_{5}$ are even as well.\n\nNow set $x=a_{2}$ and $y=a_{3}$.

We will prove that there is no pair of positive even numbers $(x, y)$ satisfying these two conditions, thus yielding a contradiction to the assumption.\n\nAssume there exists a pair $\\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\\right)$ of positive even numbers satisfying the two conditions $\\left(x_{0}+1\\right) \\mid\\left(y_{0}^{2}+1\\right)$ and $\\left(y_{0}+1\\right) \\mid\\left(x_{0}^{2}+1\\right)$.\n\nThen one has $\\left(x_{0}+1\\right) \\mid\\left(y_{0}^{2}+1+x_{0}^{2}-1\\right)$, i.e., $\\left(x_{0}+1\\right) \\mid\\left(x_{0}^{2}+y_{0}^{2}\\right)$, and similarly $\\left(y_{0}+1\\right) \\mid\\left(x_{0}^{2}+y_{0}^{2}\\right)$.

So there are at least $n$ pairs of disjoint intervals among $\\left(I_{1}, I_{2}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(I_{n-1}, I_{n}\\right),\\left(I_{n}, I_{1}\\right) ;\\left(J_{1}, J_{2}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(J_{n-1}, J_{n}\\right),\\left(J_{n}, J_{1}\\right)$.\n\nNext, every two nonadjacent boxes intersect, hence their projections on both axes intersect, too. Then the claim below shows that at most 3 pairs among $\\left(I_{1}, I_{2}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(I_{n-1}, I_{n}\\right),\\left(I_{n}, I_{1}\\right)$ are disjoint, and the same holds for $\\left(J_{1}, J_{2}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(J_{n-1}, J_{n}\\right),\\left(J_{n}, J_{1}\\right)$. Consequently $n \\leq 3+3=6$, as stated. Thus we are left with the claim and its justification.\n\nClaim. Let $\\Delta_{1}, \\Delta_{2}, \\ldots, \\Delta_{n}$ be intervals on a straight line such that every two nonadjacent intervals intersect. Then $\\Delta_{k}$ and $\\Delta_{k+1}$ are disjoint for at most three values of $k=1, \\ldots, n$.\n\nProof. Denote $\\Delta_{k}=\\left[a_{k}, b_{k}\\right], 1 \\leq k \\leq n$. Let $\\alpha=\\max \\left(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right)$ be the rightmost among the left endpoints of $\\Delta_{1}, \\ldots, \\Delta_{n}$, and let $\\beta=\\min \\left(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right)$ be the leftmost among their right endpoints. Assume that $\\alpha=a_{2}$ without loss of generality.\n\nIf $\\alpha \\leq \\beta$ then $a_{i} \\leq \\alpha \\leq \\beta \\leq b_{i}$ for all $i$. Every $\\Delta_{i}$ contains $\\alpha$, and thus no disjoint pair $\\left(\\Delta_{i}, \\Delta_{i+1}\\right)$ exists.\n\n\n\nIf $\\beta<\\alpha$ then $\\beta=b_{i}$ for some $i$ such that $a_{i}<b_{i}=\\beta<\\alpha=a_{2}<b_{2}$, hence $\\Delta_{2}$ and $\\Delta_{i}$ are disjoint. Now $\\Delta_{2}$ intersects all remaining intervals except possibly $\\Delta_{1}$ and $\\Delta_{3}$, so $\\Delta_{2}$ and $\\Delta_{i}$ can be disjoint only if $i=1$ or $i=3$. Suppose by symmetry that $i=3$; then $\\beta=b_{3}$. Since each of the intervals $\\Delta_{4}, \\ldots, \\Delta_{n}$ intersects $\\Delta_{2}$, we have $a_{i} \\leq \\alpha \\leq b_{i}$ for $i=4, \\ldots, n$. Therefore $\\alpha \\in \\Delta_{4} \\cap \\ldots \\cap \\Delta_{n}$, in particular $\\Delta_{4} \\cap \\ldots \\cap \\Delta_{n} \\neq \\emptyset$. Similarly, $\\Delta_{5}, \\ldots, \\Delta_{n}, \\Delta_{1}$ all intersect $\\Delta_{3}$, so that $\\Delta_{5} \\cap \\ldots \\cap \\Delta_{n} \\cap \\Delta_{1} \\neq \\emptyset$ as $\\beta \\in \\Delta_{5} \\cap \\ldots \\cap \\Delta_{n} \\cap \\Delta_{1}$. This leaves $\\left(\\Delta_{1}, \\Delta_{2}\\right),\\left(\\Delta_{2}, \\Delta_{3}\\right)$ and $\\left(\\Delta_{3}, \\Delta_{4}\\right)$ as the only candidates for disjoint interval pairs, as desired.']"

- The set S of points with integer coordinates in the plane.
- The relation of k-friends: two distinct points A, B in S are k-friends if there exists C in S such that the area of triangle ABC equals k.
- The k-clique: a subset T of S where every two distinct points are k-friends.
- The objective: find the minimal k such that a k-clique has size greater than 200.
- Key actions: defining k-friendship via area with external point C, and clique requiring pairwise friends.

Step 2
#Plan#:
- Restrict S to a sparser lattice: redefine S as points whose coordinates are both even integers to increase difficulty by reducing point density and constraining possible areas.
- Alter the k-clique definition: require that for every pair of points in T, the corresponding point C (from the k-friend condition) must lie within T, ensuring internal dependency and increasing density needs.
- Add a geometric constraint: impose that no three points in T are collinear to prevent zero-area triangles and force non-degenerate configurations, adding proof complexity.
- Justification: the modifications interconnect to enhance difficulty; sparser S limits candidate points, internal C requires dense subsets, and no collinearity avoids trivialities, together demanding deeper geometric reasoning.

By definition, $B=(u, v)$ satisfies this condition if and only if there is a point $C=(x, y) \\in S$ such that $\\frac{1}{2}|u y-v x|=k$. (This is a well-known formula expressing the area of triangle $A B C$ when $A$ is the origin.)\n\nTo say that there exist integers $x, y$ for which $|u y-v x|=2 k$, is equivalent to saying that the greatest common divisor of $u$ and $v$ is also a divisor of $2 k$. Summing up, a point $B=(u, v) \\in S$ is a $k$-friend of $(0,0)$ if and only if $\\operatorname{gcd}(u, v)$ divides $2 k$.\n\nTranslation by a vector with integer coordinates does not affect $k$-friendship; if two points are $k$-friends, so are their translates. It follows that two points $A, B \\in S, A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$, are $k$-friends if and only if the point $(u-s, v-t)$ is a $k$-friend of $(0,0)$; i.e., if $\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t) \\mid 2 k$.\n\nLet $n$ be a positive integer which does not divide $2 k$. We claim that a $k$-clique cannot have more than $n^{2}$ elements.\n\nIndeed, all points $(x, y) \\in S$ can be divided into $n^{2}$ classes determined by the remainders that $x$ and $y$ leave in division by $n$. If a set $T$ has more than $n^{2}$ elements, some two points $A, B \\in T, A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$, necessarily fall into the same class. This means that $n \\mid u-s$ and $n \\mid v-t$. Hence $n \\mid d$ where $d=\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t)$. And since $n$ does not divide $2 k$, also $d$ does not divide $2 k$. Thus $A$ and $B$ are not $k$-friends and the set $T$ is not a $k$-clique.\n\nNow let $M(k)$ be the least positive integer which does not divide $2 k$. Write $M(k)=m$ for the moment and consider the set $T$ of all points $(x, y)$ with $0 \\leq x, y<m$. There are $m^{2}$ of them. If $A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$ are two distinct points in $T$ then both differences $|u-s|,|v-t|$ are integers less than $m$ and at least one of them is positive. By the definition of $m$, every positive integer less than $m$ divides $2 k$. Therefore $u-s$ (if nonzero) divides $2 k$, and the same is true of $v-t$. So $2 k$ is divisible by $\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t)$, meaning that $A, B$ are $k$-friends. Thus $T$ is a $k$-clique.\n\nIt follows that the maximum size of a $k$-clique is $M(k)^{2}$, with $M(k)$ defined as above. We are looking for the minimum $k$ such that $M(k)^{2}>200$.\n\nBy the definition of $M(k), 2 k$ is divisible by the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, M(k)-1$, but not by $M(k)$ itself. If $M(k)^{2}>200$ then $M(k) \\geq 15$. Trying to hit $M(k)=15$ we get a contradiction immediately ( $2 k$ would have to be divisible by 3 and 5 , but not by 15 ).\n\nSo let us try $M(k)=16$. Then $2 k$ is divisible by the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, 15$, hence also by their least common multiple $L$, but not by 16 . And since $L$ is not a multiple of 16 , we infer that $k=L / 2$ is the least $k$ with $M(k)=16$.\n\nFinally, observe that if $M(k) \\geq 17$ then $2 k$ must be divisible by the least common multiple of $1,2, \\ldots, 16$, which is equal to $2 L$. Then $2 k \\geq 2 L$, yielding $k>L / 2$.\n\nIn conclusion, the least $k$ with the required property is equal to $L / 2=180180$.']"

So there are $N$ admissible processes, among which $M$ are restricted.\n\nIn every admissible process, restricted or not, each one of the lamps $1, \\ldots, n$ goes from off to on, so it is switched an odd number of times; and each one of the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ goes from off to off, so it is switched an even number of times.\n\nNotice that $M>0$; i.e., restricted admissible processes do exist (it suffices to switch each one of the lamps $1, \\ldots, n$ just once and then choose one of them and switch it $k-n$ times, which by hypothesis is an even number).\n\nConsider any restricted admissible process $\\mathbf{p}$. Take any lamp $\\ell, 1 \\leq \\ell \\leq n$, and suppose that it was switched $k_{\\ell}$ times. As noticed, $k_{\\ell}$ must be odd.

In any of these combinations, each one of the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ gets switched an even number of times and each one of the lamps $1, \\ldots, n$ remains switched an odd number of times, so the final state is the same as that resulting from the original process $\\mathbf{p}$.\n\nThis shows that every restricted admissible process $\\mathbf{p}$ can be modified in $2^{k-n}$ ways, giving rise to $2^{k-n}$ distinct admissible processes (with all lamps allowed).\n\nNow we show that every admissible process $\\mathbf{q}$ can be achieved in that way.

So the performed replacements have affected each lamp with a label $\\ell \\leq n$ also an even number of times; hence in the overall effect the final state of each lamp has remained the same. This means that the resulting process $\\mathbf{p}$ is admissible - and clearly restricted, as the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ are not involved in it any more.\n\nIf we now take process $\\mathbf{p}$ and reverse all these replacements, then we obtain process $\\mathbf{q}$. These reversed replacements are nothing else than the modifications described in the foregoing paragraphs.\n\nThus there is a one-to- $\\left(2^{k-n}\\right)$ correspondence between the $M$ restricted admissible processes and the total of $N$ admissible processes.

3. Add a geometric constraint to the triple: require that the cell at the position (row of $C_3$, column of $C_1$) must be red to establish a rectangle dependency and increase reasoning difficulty.  
4. Specify cell distinctness: explicitly state that all cells in the triple are distinct to resolve ambiguity.

For $n=2012$ this gives $N_{\\min }=4022$.\n\na) If $N=2 n-2$ player $A$ can achieve her goal. Let her start the game with a regular distribution: $n-2$ boxes with 2 coins and 2 boxes with 1 coin. Call the boxes of the two kinds red and white respectively. We claim that on her first move $A$ can achieve a regular distribution again, regardless of $B$ 's first move $M$. She acts according as the following situation $S$ occurs after $M$ or not: The initial distribution contains a red box $R$ with 2 white neighbors, and $R$ receives no coins from them on move $M$.\n\nSuppose that $S$ does not occur. Exactly one of the coins $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ in a given red box $X$ is involved in $M$, say $c_{1}$. If $M$ passes $c_{1}$ to the right neighbor of $X$, let $A$ pass $c_{2}$ to its left neighbor, and vice versa. By doing so with all red boxes $A$ performs a legal move $M^{\\prime}$. Thus $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$ combined move the 2 coins of every red box in opposite directions. Hence after $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$ are complete each neighbor of a red box $X$ contains exactly 1 coin that was initially in $X$. So each box with a red neighbor is non-empty after $M^{\\prime}$. If initially there is a box $X$ with 2 white neighbors ( $X$ is red and unique) then $X$ receives a coin from at least one of them on move $M$ since $S$ does not occur. Such a coin is not involved in $M^{\\prime}$, so $X$ is also non-empty after $M^{\\prime}$. Furthermore each box $Y$ has given away its initial content after $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$. A red neighbor of $Y$ adds 1 coin to it; a white neighbor adds at most 1 coin because it is not involved in $M^{\\prime}$. Hence each box contains 1 or 2 coins after $M^{\\prime}$. Because $N=2 n-2$, such a distribution is regular.\n\nNow let $S$ occur after move $M$. Then $A$ leaves untouched the exceptional red box $R$. With all remaining red boxes she proceeds like in the previous case, thus making a legal move $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Box $R$ receives no coins from its neighbors on either move, so there is 1 coin in it after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Like above $M$ and $M^{\\prime \\prime}$ combined pass exactly 1 coin from every red box different from $R$ to each of its neighbors. Every box except $R$ has a red neighbor different from $R$, hence all boxes are non-empty after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Next, each box $Y$ except $R$ loses its initial content after $M$ and $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. A red neighbor of $Y$ adds at most 1 coin to it; a white neighbor also adds at most 1 coin as it does not participate in $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Thus each box has 1 or 2 coins after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$, and the obtained distribution is regular.\n\nPlayer $A$ can apply the described strategy indefinitely, so $N=2 n-2$ enables her to succeed.\n\nb) For $N \\leq 2 n-3$ player $B$ can achieve an empty box after some move of $A$. Let $\\alpha$ be a set of $\\ell$ consecutive boxes containing a total of $N(\\alpha)$ coins. We call $\\alpha$ an $\\operatorname{arc}$ if $\\ell \\leq n-2$ and $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$. Note that $\\ell \\geq 2$ by the last condition. Moreover if both extremes of $\\alpha$ are non-empty boxes then $N(\\alpha) \\geq 2$, so that $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$ implies $\\ell \\geq 3$. Observe also that if an extreme $X$ of $\\alpha$ has more than 1 coin then ignoring $X$ yields a shorter arc. It follows that every arc contains an arc whose extremes have at most 1 coin each.\n\nGiven a clockwise labeling $1,2, \\ldots, n$ of the boxes, suppose that boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ form an arc $\\alpha$, with $\\ell \\leq n-2$ and $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$. Suppose also that all $n \\geq 7$ boxes are non-empty. Then $B$ can move so that an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$ will appear after any response of $A$.\n\n\n\nOne may assume exactly 1 coin in boxes 1 and $\\ell$ by a previous remark. Let $B$ pass 1 coin in counterclockwise direction from box 1 and box $n$, and in clockwise direction from each remaining box. This leaves $N(\\alpha)-2$ coins in the boxes of $\\alpha$. In addition, due to $3 \\leq \\ell \\leq n-2$, box $\\ell$ has exactly 1 coin $c$, the one received from box $\\ell-1$.\n\nLet player $A$ 's next move $M$ pass $k \\leq 2$ coins to boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ from the remaining ones. Only boxes 1 and $\\ell$ can receive such coins, at most 1 each. If $k<2$ then after move $M$ boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ form an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$. If $k=2$ then $M$ adds a coin to box $\\ell$. Also $M$ does not move coin $c$ from $\\ell$ because $c$ is involved in the previous move of $B$. In summary boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ contain $N(\\alpha)$ coins like before, so they form an arc. However there are 2 coins now in the extreme $\\ell$ of the arc. Ignore $\\ell$ to obtain a shorter arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$.\n\nConsider any initial distribution without empty boxes. Since $N \\leq 2 n-3$, there are at least 3 boxes in it with exactly 1 coin. It follows from $n \\geq 7$ that some 2 of them are the extremes of an arc $\\alpha$. Hence $B$ can make the move described above, which leads to an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$ after $A^{\\prime}$ 's response. If all boxes in the new distribution are non-empty he can repeat the same, and so on. Because $N(\\alpha)$ cannot decrease indefinitely, an empty box will occur after some move of $A$.""]"

Hence $y+z=503 k$ is even too, meaning that $k$ is even. Thus $k=2$ or $k=4$. Clearly (1) has no integer solutions for $k=4$. If $k=2$ then (1) takes the form $(y+z)^{2}-5 y z=4$.

Consider $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ given by $f(n)=n$ for all $n \\equiv 1$ or 2 modulo 3 , and $f(n)=2 n$ for $n \\equiv 0$ modulo 3 . Moreover, give a positive integer $n$ the $i$-th color if $n \\equiv i(3)$.\n\nBy construction we have $f(1+2)=6 \\neq 3=f(1)+f(2)$ and hence $f$ has property (ii).\n\nNow let $n, m$ be positive integers with the same color $i$. If $i=0$, then $n+m$ has color 0 , so $f(n+m)=$ $2(n+m)=2 n+2 m=f(n)+f(m)$. If $i=1$, then $n+m$ has color 2 , so $f(n+m)=n+m=f(n)+f(m)$. Finally, if $i=2$, then $n+m$ has color 1 , so $f(n+m)=n+m=f(n)+f(m)$. Therefore $f$ also satisfies condition (i).\n\nNext we show that there is no such function and coloring for $k=2$.\n\nConsider any coloring of $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with 2 colors and any function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ satisfying conditions (i) and (ii). Then there exist positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that $f(m+n) \\neq f(m)+f(n)$. Choose $m$ and $n$ such that their sum is minimal among all such $m, n$ and define $a=m+n$. Then in particular for every $b<a$ we have $f(b)=b f(1)$ and $f(a) \\neq a f(1)$.\n\nIf $a$ is even, then condition (i) for $m=n=\\frac{a}{2}$ implies $f(a)=f\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)+f\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)=f(1) a$, a contradiction. Hence $a$ is odd. We will prove two lemmas.\n\nLemma 1. Any odd integer $b<a$ has a different color than $a$.\n\nProof. Suppose that $b<a$ is an odd integer, and that $a$ and $b$ have the same color. Then on the one hand, $f(a+b)=f(a)+b f(1)$. On the other hand, we also have $f(a+b)=f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)+f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)=(a+b) f(1)$, as $\\frac{a+b}{2}$ is a positive integer smaller than $a$. Hence $f(a)=f(a+b)-b f(1)=(a+b) f(1)-b f(1)=a f(1)$, which is again a contradiction. Therefore all odd integers smaller than $a$ have a color different from that of $a$.\n\nLemma 2. Any even integer $b<a$ has the same color as a\n\nProof. Suppose $b<a$ is an even integer, and that $a$ and $b$ have different colors. Then $a-b$ is an odd integer smaller than $a$, so it has the same color as $b$. Thus $f(a)=f(a-b)+f(b)=(a-b) f(1)+b f(1)=a f(1)$, a contradiction. Hence all even integers smaller than $a$ have the same color as $a$.\n\nSuppose now $a+1$ has the same color as $a$. As $a>1$, we have $\\frac{a+1}{2}<a$ and therefore $f(a+1)=2 f\\left(\\frac{a+1}{2}\\right)=$ $(a+1) f(1)$. As $a-1$ is an even integer smaller than $a$, we have by Lemma 2 that $a-1$ also has the same color as $a$. Hence $2 f(a)=f(2 a)=f(a+1)+f(a-1)=(a+1) f(1)+(a-1) f(1)=2 a f(1)$, which implies that $f(a)=a f(1)$, a contradiction. So $a$ and $a+1$ have different colors.\n\nSince $a-2$ is an odd integer smaller than $a$, by Lemma 1 it has a color different from that of $a$, so $a-2$ and $a+1$ have the same color. Also, we have seen by Lemma 2 that $a-1$ and $a$ have the same color. So $f(a)+f(a-1)=f(2 a-1)=f(a+1)+f(a-2)=(a+1) f(1)+(a-2) f(1)=(2 a-1) f(1)$, from which it follows that $f(a)=(2 a-1) f(1)-f(a-1)=(2 a-1) f(1)-(a-1) f(1)=a f(1)$, which contradicts our choice of $a$ and finishes the proof.'
 'We prove that $k \\leq 3$ just as in first solution.\n\nNext we show that there is no such function and coloring for $k=2$.\n\nConsider any coloring of $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with 2 colors and any function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ satisfying conditions (i) and (ii).

Then we have the relations\n\n$$\nf(2 n)=2 c, \\quad f(4 n)=4 c, \\quad f(6 n)=2 d\n$$\n\n- If $n$ and $2 n$ have the same color, then $f(3 n)=f(n)+f(2 n)=3 c=3 f(n)$.\n- If $n$ and $3 n$ have the same color, then $4 c=f(4 n)=f(n)+f(3 n)=c+f(3 n)$, so $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n- If $2 n$ and $4 n$ have the same color, then $2 d=f(6 n)=f(2 n)+f(4 n)=2 c+4 c=6 c$, so $f(3 n)=d=3 c$.\n- Otherwise $n$ and $4 n$ have the same color, and $2 n$ and $3 n$ both have the opposite color to $n$. Therefore we compute $5 c=f(n)+f(4 n)=f(5 n)=f(2 n)+f(3 n)=2 c+f(3 n)$ so $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n\nConsequently, for $k=2$ we necessarily have $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n\nNow let $a$ be the smallest integer such that $f(a) \\neq a f(1)$. In particular $a$ is odd and $a>3$. Consider the three integers $a, \\frac{a-3}{2}, \\frac{a+3}{2}$.

It is clearly true for $l=0$. If $x+l m$ is black and satisfies $f(x+l m)=$ $f(x)+l f(m)$, then $f(x+(l+1) m)=f(x+l m)+f(m)=f(x)+(l+1) f(m)$ and $f(x+(l+1) m+n)=$ $f(x+l m)+f(m+n)=f(x)+l f(m)+f(m+n) \\neq f(x)+(l+1) f(m)+f(n)=f(x+(l+1) m)+f(n)$, so $x+(l+1) m$ is not the same color of $n$, therefore $x+(l+1) m$ is black. Thjs completes the induction.\n\nIn particular we then must have that $2^{l} n$ is white for every $l$, because otherwise since $2^{l} m$ is black we would have $2^{l} f(m+n)=f\\left(2^{l} m+2^{l} n\\right)=f\\left(2^{l} m\\right)+f\\left(2^{l} n\\right)=2^{l}(f(m)+f(n))$, and consequently $f(m+n)=$ $f(m)+f(n)$.\n\nLemma 5.

#Elements Identified#:
- **Variables**: \( m > 1 \) is the primary integer variable to be determined.
- **Sequence definition**: Defined by initial terms \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 1 \), \( a_3 = 4 \), and a linear recurrence \( a_n = m(a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}) - a_{n-3} \) for \( n \geq 4 \).
- **Condition**: Every term \( a_n \) must be a perfect square.
- **Objective**: Find all integers \( m > 1 \) satisfying the condition.
- **Theme**: Linear recurrences with perfect square properties, focusing on integer sequences.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. **Introduce an additional parameter**: Add a new integer variable \( k > 0 \) to increase dimensionality and decision space.
2. **Modify initial conditions**: Change \( a_3 \) from 4 to \( k^2 \) to make it variable and dependent on \( k \), ensuring initial squares but introducing a parameter that must be chosen.
3. **Modify recurrence relation**: Adjust the recurrence to \( a_n = m(a_{n-1} + k a_{n-2}) - a_{n-3} \), incorporating \( k \) as a coefficient to create interdependence between \( m \) and \( k \), thereby increasing reasoning depth.
4. **Update objective**: Shift from finding only \( m \) to finding all pairs \( (m, k) \), requiring simultaneous determination and satisfying the condition.
   - Ensure logical interconnection: The modified sequence relies on both \( m \) and \( k \), with \( k \) affecting both the initial term and recurrence. The condition (all terms squares) links \( m \) and \( k \) through recursive constraints.
   - Complexity increase: Parameters \( m \) and \( k \) must be jointly optimized; the formula change adds non-uniformity; initial condition variability introduces more cases.

#Elements Identified#:
1. **Grid Size**: Fixed \(2n \times 2n\) board.
2. **Domino Type**: \(2 \times 1\) or \(1 \times 2\) tiles.
3. **Coverage Rule**: Every cell must be adjacent to exactly one domino-covered cell.
4. **Adjacency Definition**: Cells sharing a common side.
5. **Objective Function**: Maximize the number of dominoes for each \(n\).
6. **Constraint Simplicity**: Standard domino placement with no overlapping or gaps.
7. **Input**: Only \(n\) (positive integer) is given.
8. **Theme**: Tiling/domino placement with isolated coverage conditions.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. **Modify Grid Size**: Replace \(2n \times 2n\) with asymmetric dimensions \(m \times k\), defined as parametric expressions of \(n\) that maintain even dimensions but introduce uneven scaling and residue dependencies. Specifically, set \(m = 2n + 2\lfloor n/3 \rfloor\) and \(k = 2n - 2\lfloor n/4 \rfloor\).
2. **Augment Coverage Rules**: Require every domino to have a specific orientation relative to adjacent dominoes. Specifically, mandate that if a domino is placed vertically, its adjacent dominoes (sharing a full edge) must include at least one horizontal domino, and vice versa.
3. **Complicate Objective**: Change the target to maximize a function of the tile count, such as the expression \(\left\lfloor m \sqrt{k}/2 \right\rfloor - (n \mod 2)\), which links the solution to modular arithmetic, irrationality, and floor operations.
4. **Add Input Constraints**: Introduce parameters \(p\) and \(q\) derived from \(n\) (e.g., \(p = 2\lfloor n/3 \rfloor\), \(q = 2\lfloor n/4 \rfloor\)) to define \(m\) and \(k\), ensuring dimensional dependencies.
5. **Ensure Cohesion**: Asymmetry in grid dimensions (\(m \neq k\)) disrupts symmetry-based arguments. The orientation rule forces complex local interactions. The parametric objective ties all variables to \(n\) and pit residues against irrational scaling.

We claim that $M=n(n+1) / 2$. The proof naturally splits into two parts: we first prove that $n(n+1) / 2$ dominoes can be placed on the board, and then show that $M \\leq n(n+1) / 2$ to complete the proof. To prove that $M \\leq$ $n(n+1) / 2$, we again border the $2 n \\times 2 n$ square board up to a $(2 n+2) \\times(2 n+2)$ square board. In fact, we shall ignore the corner border cells as they cannot be covered anyway and consider only the $2 n$ border cells along each side. We prove that out of each four border cells next to each other at most two can be covered. Suppose three out of four cells $A, B, C, D$ are covered. Then there are two possibilities below:\n\n<img_3563>\n\nor\n\n<img_3278>\n\n\n\nThe first option is that $A, B$ and $D$ are covered (marked with + in top row).

But then the cell next to $\\mathrm{B}$ has two adjacent cells with dominoes, contradiction.\n\nNow we can split the border cells along one side in groups of 4 (leaving one group of 2 if $n$ is odd). So when $n$ is even, at most $n$ of the $2 n$ border cells along one side can be covered, and when $n$ is odd, at most $n+1$ out of the $2 n$ border cells can be covered. For all four borders together, this gives a contribution of $4 n$ when $n$ is even and $4 n+4$ when $n$ is odd. Adding $4 n^{2}$ and dividing by 8 we get the desired result.'
 'Consider the number of pairs of adjacent cells, such that one of them is covered by a domino. Since each cell is adjacent to one covered cell, the number of such pairs is exactly $4 n^{2}$.

Indeed, if one of the sides the square had three rectangles adjacent to it, removing these three rectangles would leave a polygon with eight vertices, which is clearly not the union of two rectangles. Moreover, since $m>10$, each side of the square has at least two adjacent rectangles. Hence each side of the square has precisely two adjacent rectangles, and thus the only way of partitionning the square into five rectangles is to have a single inner rectangle and four outer rectangles each covering of the four corners of the square, as claimed.\n\nLet us now show that a square of size $12 \\times 12$ cannot be dissected in the desired way. Let $R_{1}, R_{2}, R_{3}$ and $R_{4}$ be the outer rectangles (in clockwise orientation along the\n\n\n\nboundary of the square). If an outer rectangle has a side of length $s$, then some adjacent outer rectangle must have a side of length $12-s$. Therefore, neither of $s=1$ or $s=6$ can be sidelengths of an outer rectangle, so the inner rectangle must have dimensions $1 \\times 6$. One of the outer rectangles (say $R_{1}$ ) must have dimensions $10 \\times x$, and an adjacent rectangle (say $R_{2}$ ) must thus have dimensions $2 \\times y$. Rectangle $R_{3}$ then has dimensions $(12-y) \\times z$, and rectangle $R_{4}$ has dimensions $(12-z) \\times(12-x)$. Note that exactly one of the three numbers $x, y, z$ is even (and equals 4 or 8 ), while the other two numbers are odd. Now, the total area of all five rectangles is\n\n$$\n144=6+10 x+2 y+(12-y) z+(12-z)(12-x)\n$$\n\nwhich simplifies to $(y-x)(z-2)=6$. As exactly one of the three numbers $x, y, z$ is even, the factors $y-x$ and $z-2$ are either both even or both odd, so their product cannot equal 6 , and thus there is no solution with $m=12$.\n\nFinally, we handle the cases $m=11$ and $m=13$, which indeed are solutions. The corresponding rectangle sets are $10 \\times 5,1 \\times 9,8 \\times 2,7 \\times 4$ and $3 \\times 6$ for $m=11$, and $10 \\times 5,9 \\times 8,4 \\times 6,3 \\times 7$ and $1 \\times 2$ for $m=13$. These sets can be found by trial and error. The corresponding partitions are shown in the figure below.\n<img_3324>']"

#Elements Identified#:
- Variables: \(k\) (positive integer for string and grid size).
- Dictionary: \(\mathcal{D}\) consists of \(k\)-letter strings with a specific character set (currently only A and B).

- Grid constraints: Each column (top-to-bottom) and each row (left-to-right) must form a string in \(\mathcal{D}\).

Step 2
#Plan#:
- Increase alphabet size: Change from binary (A,B) to an alphabet of size \(c \geq 2\) (new variable \(c\)) to add variability and complexity to string possibilities.
- Add distinctness requirement: Enforce that all row strings are pairwise distinct and all column strings are pairwise distinct, ensuring no repetitions and increasing difficulty by requiring a strict set of unique strings for constraints.
- Introduce diagonal constraint: Require that the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) must also form a string in \(\mathcal{D}\), adding a third dimension of interdependence between rows and columns.

Consider the set of all length- $k$ strings containing only $A \\mathrm{~s}$ and $B \\mathrm{~s}$ which end with a $B$, and remove the string consisting of $k$  $B \\mathrm{~s}$. Clearly there are 2 independent choices for each of the first $k-1$ letters and 1 for the last letter, and since exactly one string is excluded, there must be exactly $2^{k-1}-1$ strings in this set.\n\nSuppose Lexi tries to fill her grid. For each row to have a valid string, it must end in a $B$. But then the right column would necessarily contain $k B \\mathrm{~s}$, and not be in our set. Thus, Lexi cannot fill her grid with our set, and we must have $m \\geqslant 2^{k-1}$.\n\nNow, consider any set $\\mathcal{S}$ with at least $2^{k-1}$ strings. Clearly, if $\\mathcal{S}$ contained either the uniform string with $k A \\mathrm{~s}$ or the string with $k B \\mathrm{~s}$, then Lexi could fill her grid with all of the relevant letters and each row and column would contain that string.\n\nConsider the case where $\\mathcal{S}$ contains neither of those strings. Among all $2^{k}$ possible length$k$ strings with $A \\mathrm{~s}$ and $B \\mathrm{~s}$, each has a complement which corresponds to the string with $B$ s in every position where first string had $A$ s and vice-versa. Clearly, the string with all $A$ s is paired with the string with all $B$ s. We may assume that we do not take the two uniform strings and thus applying the pigeonhole principle to the remaining set of strings, we must have two strings which are complementary.\n\nLet this pair of strings be $\\ell, \\ell^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{S}$ in some order. Define the set of indices $\\mathcal{J}$ corresponding to the $A \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell$ and thus the $B \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell^{\\prime}$, and all other indices (not in $\\mathcal{J}$ ) correspond to $B \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell$ (and thus $A$ s in $\\ell^{\\prime}$ ). Then, we claim that Lexi puts an $A$ in the cell in row $r$, column $c$ if $r, c \\in \\mathcal{J}$ or $r, c \\notin \\mathcal{J}$, and a $B$ otherwise, each row and column contains a string in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nWe illustrate this with a simple example: If $k=6$ and we have that $A A A B A B$ and $B B B A B A$ are both in the dictionary, then Lexi could fill the table as follows:\n\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| B | B | B | A | B | A |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| B | B | B | A | B | A |\n\nSuppose we are looking at row $i$ or column $i$ for $i \\in \\mathcal{J}$. Then by construction the string in this row/column contains $A \\mathrm{~s}$ at indices $k$ with $k \\in \\mathcal{J}$ and $B$ s elsewhere, and thus is precisely $\\ell$. Suppose instead we are looking at row $i$ or column $i$ for $i \\notin \\mathcal{J}$. Then again by construction the string in this row/column contains $A$ s at indices $k$ with $k \\notin \\mathcal{J}$ and $B$ s elsewhere, and thus is precisely $\\ell^{\\prime}$. So each row and column indeed contains a string in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nThus, for any $\\mathcal{S}$ with $|\\mathcal{S}| \\geqslant 2^{k-1}$, Lexi can definitely fill the grid appropriately.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Generalize the Exponential Base:** Replace the fixed base `2` with a variable base `a > 0`, introducing another parameter to solve for, with a constraint (`a > 0, a ≠ 1`). Instead of being free, `a` will be linked to `k` through an integer parameter `b`.
2.  **Modify the Functional Ratio Condition:** Change the simple ratio `f(3):f(6)=1:3` to a more complex ratio expression `f(m)/f(n) = (p/q)^t` (`m=3, n=6, p=5, q=2, t` related to inputs) and tie the parameters `p, q` to a new integer variable `b`, increasing variable dependencies. Set `f(3)/f(6) = (b/7)^(b)` where `b` is a positive integer.
3.  **Complicate the Required Calculation:** Change the target from a simple difference `f(9) - f(3)` to a more complex fractional expression like `[f(10)]^2 / [f(5)f(20)]`, requiring multi-step manipulation of the function form. Include terms to ensure the expression simplifies reasonably (e.g., exponents summing to zero).
4.  **Introduce a Constraint on Parameters:** Constrain the value of the new variable `b` by requiring it to be a positive integer (`b ∈ \mathbb{Z}^+`), ensuring the problem requires solution identification and validation. Constrain parameters to ensure `k` is determined uniquely.
5.  **Maintain Logical Flow:** Ensure the condition using `m, n = 3, 6` solves for `a` and `k` in terms of `b`, after which using `b ∈ \mathbb{Z}^+` gives a specific integer solution for `b`. This allows evaluating the complex target expression.

- **Theme**: Finding parameter values for which a parabolic and an absolute value curve do not intersect, with algebraic and case-based reasoning.
- **Structure**: A direct algebraic problem that can be simplified using symmetry and substitution.

1. **Increase functional complexity**: Change the first function from \(y = x^2 - 4\) to \(y = |x^2 - 4|\), introducing piecewise behavior and additional critical points (at \(x = \pm 2\)), requiring piecewise-defined equation solving.
2. **Modify the absolute value function**: Alter \(y = 2|x| + k\) to \(y = 2|x - 1| + k\), adding a horizontal shift (at \(x = 1\)) that removes symmetry, thus increasing the number of cases for analysis.
3. **Enhance reasoning requirements**: Mandate detailed case analysis by specifying that justification must explicitly cover intervals defined by critical points (\(x = -2, x = 1, x = 2\)) and address dependent behavior around these points. This refines the action from simple solving to multi-step, interconnected case handling.
- **Coherence**: All modifications interlock; the piecewise and shifted functions create dependencies where \(k\) affects intersection existence differently in each interval, increasing algebraic and logical depth while keeping \(k\) the primary variable for solution.

- **Conditions**: Constant speeds and current; journey direction (downstream only).  
- **Core concept**: Relating speeds and times using \(d = v \cdot t\).  
- **Missing challenge**: No constraints for reverse journey, varying environmental factors, or segment-based complexities.  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
1. **Add upstream journey**: Introduce paddling *against* the current from \(B\) to \(A\) with a new time \(t_{\text{up}}\).  
2. **Incorporate wind**: Wind speed affects paddling speed in specific segments (downstream/upstream).  
3. **Vary current by segment**: River splits into two equal-length segments with distinct current speeds \(c_1\) and \(c_2\).  
- **Integration**: Wind increases/decreases paddling speed for respective directions; downstream and upstream times constrain \(c_1\), \(c_2\), and wind effects.  
- **Ensuring solvability**: Define wind impact multiplicatively to retain linear equations. Provide times for all scenarios to avoid ambiguity.

- Theme: Construction of a special infinite table through arithmetic sequences linked to primality sieving, requiring derivation of the general term.

- Objective: Minimize a quadratic expression $x^2 + 16y^2$
- Theme: Constrained optimization with real variables, aiming for a numerical minimum value
- Structure: Involves substitution or calculus to solve, limited to two variables

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. Increase the number of variables: Introduce a third real variable $z$ to expand the dimensionality and require handling multiple dependencies.
2. Increase the number of constraints: Add a second constraint that is nonlinear (specifically, a circle constraint $y^2 + z^2 = 9$) to prevent trivial solutions and necessitate simultaneous constraint satisfaction.
3. Modify the objective function: Incorporate the new variable $z$ by adding $z^2$ (to maintain the sum-of-squares theme and create interplay with the new constraint) while keeping the original $x^2 + 16y^2$ intact. This ensures all components are interconnected through variables and constraints.
4. Justify complexity: The additions introduce a nonlinear constraint and additional variable, requiring more advanced substitution or optimization techniques, and real-world aspects are implied via geometric interpretations (e.g., distances).

- **Key operation**: Implicitly requires solving for the relationship between `(x−2013)` and `(y−2014)`.  

Step 2  
**#Plan#**:  
1. **Replace constants with symmetric parameters**: Substitute `2013` and `2014` with integers `a` and `b`, adding the constraint that `a + b = 4027` to preserve symmetry and theme.  
2. **Introduce a third constrained variable**: Add a parameter `c` defined as `c = a + b - 2015`, forcing interdependence.  
3. **Add an optimization layer**: Require `|a - b|` to be minimized under the condition that `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `c` are real numbers satisfying the revised equation.  
4. **Maintain core equation structure**: Retain the fraction format but generalize the constants.

#Plan#:
1.  **Modify Constant & Introduce Parameter:** Replace the constant `10000` with a parameter `k` (`k > 0`). This requires solving parametrically and adds abstraction.
2.  **Variable Logarithm Base:** Replace the fixed base `10` in all logarithms with a variable base `a` (`a > 0`, `a ≠ 1`). This significantly increases complexity as the solution depends on `a`, introducing constraints on `a` for solution existence/validity.
3.  **Add Variable Constraint:** Explicitly require `x > 1` to ensure `log_a(log_a x)` is defined within real numbers.
4.  **Increase Reasoning Demand:** Require expressing the solution `x` explicitly in terms of `a` and `k` where possible, moving beyond just finding numeric solutions.

**#Elements Identified#:**
- **Variables:** Positive integers \(m\) and \(n\) to be determined.
- **Conditions:** No calculator use; summation involves trigonometric functions raised to a specific power over a fixed angular range (1° to 89°, 89 terms).
- **Participants/Actions:** The expression is a sum of \(\sin^6 x^\circ\) for integer \(x\) from 1 to 89, simplified to a fraction \(\frac{m}{n}\).
- **Theme:** Trigonometric summation leveraging symmetries (e.g., \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\)) and power-reduction identities.
- **Complexity Modifiable Elements:**  
  - The exponent (6) can be increased.  
  - The trigonometric functions can include cosine alongside sine.  
  - Additional constraints (e.g., coprimality) can be imposed.  
  - The range or step size could be adjusted, but it should maintain the theme.  

### Step 2
**#Plan#:**  
1. **Increase the Exponent:** Change the power from 6 to 8 to require more advanced power-reduction formulas (e.g., reducing \(\sin^8\theta\) involves multiple steps via \(\sin^2\theta\), leading to higher-order multiple angles).  
2. **Incorporate Both Trigonometric Functions:** Replace \(\sin^6 x^\circ\) with \(\sin^8 x^\circ + \cos^8 x^\circ\) for each \(x\). This introduces a mixed-function sum, demanding identities for \(\sin^8\theta + \cos^8\theta\), which does not simplify as directly, and leverages symmetry differently.  
3. **Add Constraints & Concretize:** Require \(m\) and \(n\) to be coprime, ensuring the fraction is simplified, which is non-trivial after complex summation. This adds reasoning about divisibility.  
Justification: The plan increases complexity by interconnecting elements—higher powers necessitate deeper algebraic manipulation, dual functions build on symmetry (exploiting \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\)) but increase term diversity, and coprimality forces a post-summation step. Word count is managed by defining the range implicitly in the sum notation.

Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the integers and arrangements with the desired properties.\n\nThus, $f(n)$, which equals the number of such integers, also equals the number of such arrangements.\n\nTo count the number of such arrangements, we note that there are four 1 s and $n-1 \\mathrm{Xs}$ to arrange in the final $4+(n-1)=n+3$ positions, since the first position is occupied by a 1 .\n\nThere are $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)$ ways to choose the positions of the remaining four 1s, and so $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)$ arrangements.\n\nThus, $f(n)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)=\\frac{(n+3) !}{4 !(n-1) !}=\\frac{(n+3)(n+2)(n+1)(n)}{4 !}=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the positive integers $n$ between 1 and 2014, inclusive, for which the units digit of $f(n)$ is 1 .\n\nNow $f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$ is an integer for all positive integers $n$, since it is counting the number of things with a certain property.\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 0 or 5 , then $n$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 2 or 7 , then $n+3$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 3 or 8 , then $n+2$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 4 or 9 , then $n+1$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nThus, if the units digit of $n$ is $0,2,3,4,5,7,8$, or 9 , then $n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)$\n\nis a multiple of 5 and so $f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$ is a multiple of 5 , since the denominator contains no factors of 5 that can divide the factor from the numerator.\n\nTherefore, if the units digit of $n$ is $0,2,3,4,5,7,8$, or 9 , then $f(n)$ is divisible by 5 , and so cannot have a units digit of 1 .\n\nSo we consider the cases where $n$ has a units digit of 1 or of 6 ; these are the only possible values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ can have a units digit of 1 .\n\nWe note that $3 f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8}$, which is a positive integer for all positive integers $n$.\n\n\n\nAlso, we note that if $f(n)$ has units digit 1 , then $3 f(n)$ has units digit 3 , and if $3 f(n)$ has units digit 3 , then $f(n)$ must have units digit 1 .\n\nTherefore, determining the values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ has units digit 1 is equivalent to determining the values of $n$ for which $\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8}$ has units digit 3 .\n\nWe consider the integers $n$ in groups of 40 . (Intuitively, we do this because the problem seems to involve multiples of 5 and multiples of 8 , and $5 \\times 8=40$.)\n\nIf $n$ has units digit 1 , then $n=40 k+1$ or $n=40 k+11$ or $n=40 k+21$ or $n=40 k+31$ for some integer $k \\geq 0$.\n\nIf $n$ has units digit 6 , then $n=40 k+6$ or $n=40 k+16$ or $n=40 k+26$ or $n=40 k+36$ for some integer $k \\geq 0$.\n\nIf $n=40 k+1$, then\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n3 f(n) & =\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(40 k+1)(40 k+2)(40 k+3)(40 k+4)}{8} \\\\\n& =(40 k+1)(20 k+1)(40 k+3)(10 k+1)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe units digit of $40 k+1$ is 1 , the units digit of $20 k+1$ is 1 , the units digit of $40 k+3$ is 3 , and the units digit of $10 k+1$ is 1 , so the units digit of the product is the units digit of $(1)(1)(3)(1)$ or 3.\n\nIn a similar way, we treat the remaining seven cases and summarize all eight cases in a chart:\n\n| $n$ | $3 f(n)$ simplified | Units digit of $3 f(n)$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $40 k+1$ | $(40 k+1)(20 k+1)(40 k+3)(10 k+1)$ | 3 |\n| $40 k+11$ | $(40 k+11)(10 k+3)(40 k+13)(20 k+7)$ | 3 |\n| $40 k+21$ | $(40 k+21)(20 k+11)(40 k+23)(10 k+6)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+31$ | $(40 k+31)(10 k+8)(40 k+33)(20 k+17)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+6$ | $(20 k+3)(40 k+7)(10 k+2)(40 k+9)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+16$ | $(10 k+4)(40 k+17)(20 k+9)(40 k+19)$ | 8 |\n| $40 k+26$ | $(20 k+13)(40 k+27)(10 k+7)(40 k+29)$ | 3 |\n| $40 k+36$ | $(10 k+9)(40 k+37)(20 k+19)(40 k+39)$ | 3 |\n\n(Note that, for example, when $n=40 k+16$, the simplified version of $3 f(n)$ is $(10 k+4)(40 k+17)(20 k+9)(40 k+19)$, so the units digit of $3 f(n)$ is the units digit of $(4)(7)(9)(9)$ which is the units digit of 2268 , or 8 .)\n\nTherefore, $f(n)$ has units digit 1 whenever $n=40 k+1$ or $n=40 k+11$ or $n=40 k+26$ or $n=40 k+36$ for some integer $k \\geq 0$.\n\nThere are 4 such integers $n$ between each pair of consecutive multiples of 40 .\n\nSince $2000=50 \\times 40$, then 2000 is the 50 th multiple of 40 , so there are $50 \\times 4=200$ integers $n$ less than 2000 for which the units digit of $f(n)$ is 1 .\n\nBetween 2000 and 2014, inclusive, there are two additional integers: $n=40(50)+1=2001$ and $n=40(50)+11=2011$.\n\nIn total, 202 of the integers $f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(2014)$ have a units digit of 1 .']"

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Add Penalty Variable:** Introduce a new penalty event (e.g., Slow Over Rate, denoted `S`) with a corresponding **negative** integer point value `s` deducted from the total points. Add a column `S` to the table for penalty occurrences per team.
2.  **Modify Bonus Points:** Instead of simple `a* A + b*B`, make bonus points more complex. Replace `a` and `b` with **rational number multipliers** `α` and `β`, applied only to a *subset* of the raw bonus counts `A` and `B`. Specifically, define: *Batting Bonus Points = α * (B - P)*, *Bowling Bonus Points = β * (A - O)* where `P` is a fixed threshold for batting penalty, and `O` is a fixed threshold for bowling penalty (assign plausible `P`, `O` values). `α` and `β` must be determined.
3.  **Add Constraint Ratios:** Introduce explicit ratio constraints between the fundamental point values: `w / d = R1` and `a / b = R2`, where `R1` and `R2` are given specific rational numbers, requiring the determined `w, d, a, b` (or their rational equivalents) to satisfy these ratios exactly.
4.  **Integrate Loss Column:** Make the Losses column functionally relevant beyond checking match totals. State explicitly that the total of `W + Losses + D = 17` **must be verified for all teams** before solving, potentially revealing inconsistencies needing resolution (e.g., off-by-one data error, difference must equal penalty count `S`).
5.  **Ensure Interconnection:** Penalties (`S, s`) and modified bonuses (`α, β, P, O`) are directly embedded in the new points formula. The ratio constraints (`R1`, `R2`) rigidly couple `w` & `d` and `a` & `b` (or `α` & `β`). Loss verification ensures data validity prerequisite.

#Elements Identified#:
*   Core concept: Find a positive real number `x` satisfying an equation involving the floor function `⌊x⌋`.
*   Given equation: `x * ⌊x⌋ = C` (where `C` is a constant, originally 17).
*   Single variable: `x`.
*   Condition: `x` is positive.
*   Process: Setting `n = ⌊x⌋` (an integer), expressing `x = n + f` (where `0 ≤ f < 1`), and solving the resulting equation for `n` and `f`.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Parametrize the Constant (C):** Replace the constant `17` with an expression involving the floor variable `k = ⌊x⌋`.
    2.  **Introduce Fractional Part Constraint:** Include an additional condition that the fractional part `{x} = x - ⌊x⌋` must satisfy, expressed in terms of `k` and a new constant.
    3.  **Demand Unique Solution:** Replace ""what is `x`"" with ""find all possible values of `x`"" to imply the need to verify solution existence.
    4.  **Increase Symbolic Reasoning:** Use `k` explicitly in the equation for better generalization.
    5.  **Enhance Variable Dependency:** Link the right-hand side and the fractional part constraint directly to `k`, creating simultaneous constraints.
    6.  **Integrate Derived Identity:** Mandate the use of the fractional part `{x}` in the setup.
    7.  **Bound Variable:** Specify that `k = ⌊x⌋` is a natural number for clarity and domain restriction.
    8.  **Final Form:** Replace `C` with the expression `5k + 2`. The fractional part constraint is `x * {x} = 4 - k`. These are chosen so solutions exist for specific integer `k` ranges.

*   **Target:** Compute tan ∠ABD.
*   **Fixed Elements:** Point A, properties of parallelograms and rotation.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Introduce a Variable Ratio for Areas:** Instead of the three areas being equal, set two specified areas equal to each other and make them *proportional* to the third area by a variable constant $k$. Specifically, set $[B'CD] = [ABD']$ and $[B'CD] = k[BC C']$ or $[ABD'] = k[BC C']$. The problem must then solve for $\tan \angle ABD$ in terms of $k$, or find $k$ given an additional constraint.
2.  **Add a Length Ratio Constraint:** Introduce a specific length ratio involving the image points to fix the configuration. For example, state that AD = m * MD', where M is a newly defined point, such as the intersection point of diagonals, midpoint of BD, or foot of a perpendicular. The problem then requires solving for $\tan \angle ABD$ in terms of both $k$ and $m$, or to find a relationship between $k$ and $m$ satisfying the condition. This adds an additional dependency.
3.  **Concretize the Rotation:** Instead of a general rotation resulting in D on AB', specify the rotation angle as $\theta$. The condition D on AB' and the area/length ratios then constrain $\theta$. This requires expressing $\theta$ in terms of the parameters or eliminating it.
4.  **Interconnect Components:** Ensure the new area ratio $k$ and the length ratio $m$ are integral to the expression derived for $\tan \angle ABD$, and that the rotation angle $\theta$ depends on these variables through the conditions imposed.

- **Objective**: Find the minimal such integer.

3. Add a constraint: Restrict \(n\) to prime positive integers, which adds a primality condition and reduces possible values, requiring additional checks.  
4. Ensure coherence: The multi-factorial definition must cover all cases (parity via residue mod \(k\)) and examples are included for clarity. Keep the structure similar to the original but with expanded complexity.  
5. Limit verbosity: Define multi-factorial concisely, use one clear example for \(k=2\), and keep the revised instruction within +30 words by trimming redundancies.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Generalize the Area Constraint:** Replace the fixed area fraction \(\frac{35}{37}\) with a parameterized expression \(\sqrt{k}\), where \(k\) is a positive real constant, making the area relationship more complex to derive and involving an additional parameter. This requires solving for the parameter later.
2.  **Add Geometric Constraint:** Introduce an additional geometric condition related to the shape of the parallelogram. Specifically, require that the parallelogram contains no obtuse angles. This adds a non-trivial constraint (\(\cos(2\theta) \geq 0\)) that must be incorporated into the minimization problem, increasing the interdependence of variables and reasoning needed.
3.  **Add Variable Constraint:** Impose an inequality constraint linking the magnitude and argument of \(z\). The constraint \(|z| \cdot \cos^2(\arg(z)) \geq 1\) adds complexity by forcing the minimization to consider a restricted domain and increasing variable dependence. This concretizes the link between magnitude and angle.

2.  **Modify Paint Coverage Pattern:** Instead of a single solid face, paint only **specific stripes on two adjacent faces**. Concretely, paint horizontal stripes (covering cubes in specific rows) on the front face and vertical stripes (covering cubes in specific columns) on the right face. This introduces irregular painted areas crossing faces or edges.
3.  **Add Complexity to Reassembly Condition:** Modify the goal condition. Instead of simply hiding *all* paint, require that the reassembled cube has **only unpainted $1 \times 1 \times 1$ cubes on all external faces and a specific colored $1 \times 1 \times 1$ cube at the center of one face**.

3.  **Introduce a Modular Dependency:** Impose a specific modular congruence on `a` relative to a new, moderately sized prime modulus (e.g., `a ≡ r (mod m)`). Choosing `m=13` and `r=5` ensures multiple solutions but adds a layer of conditional checking. This binds the previously independent conditions closer.
4.  **Ensure Interconnection:** The primality condition directly applies to the variables. The modulo condition applies to `a`. Both affect which values are possible for `(a, b)` when combined with the requirement that `log_b(a)` is rational. The core theme (rational logarithm) remains central.

    *   Add a *variable distinctness requirement*: The word must contain a distinct consonant (B, C, D) for every occurrence of a vowel (A, E) beyond the first one. This creates a dependency between vowel count and minimum distinct consonants.

- Approximation provided for cos 80° ≈ 0.17 to aid computation.
- Theme: Geometric problem involving isosceles triangles defined by a point and the vertices, with a focus on enumeration.

#Plan#:
- Change the triangle ABC to be scalene with given side lengths to increase asymmetry and computational difficulty, specifically setting BC = 10, AB = 9, AC = 5.
- Modify the isosceles condition to require that for each triangle (PAB, PBC, and PCA), P must be the vertex of the isosceles triangle (i.e., PA = PB for PAB, PB = PC for PBC, PC = PA for PCA), which implies PA = PB = PC, so P is the circumcenter.

If $n$ is not a multiple of 9 , then $l_{n}=L_{n}$, because as $x$ increases from $n-\\varepsilon$ to $n$, the floor function does not increase.

#Plan#:
- Expand the number of variables by introducing a fourth variable, $w$, which maintains the theme but increases interdependencies.
- Add multiple constraints to deepen reasoning: Modify the original equations to $xy = 72$ and $yz = 48$ for more complex factorization, and include a new constraint $x w = 108$ to tie $w$ to the system. This creates simultaneous equations that must be solved collectively.
- Incorporate a real-world constraint: Specify that $x$, $y$, $z$, $w$ represent distinct dimensions in a geometric context, such as sides of rectangles with given areas, adding a dependency that variables must be pairwise distinct. This forces evaluation of valid combinations beyond divisor checks.

1.  **Modify Logarithmic Expression:** Replace $\log \sqrt{x}$ with a term involving $\log_a x$ for a different base $a$, and introduce multiple logarithms. Replace with $\log_2 (x)$ to necessitate base change or manipulation.
2.  **Replace Fixed T with a Functional Relation:** Replace the constant $T = \frac{1}{2}$ with a parameter defined by a trigonometric identity involving a common irrational constant, increasing conceptual load and calculation steps. Set $T = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{k}\right)$ where $k$ must be determined from a physical constant ($e$).
3.  **Add Constraint on the Solution:** Introduce an additional condition or domain restriction based on a derived property of the solution set. Constrain $x$ to be large enough such that the largest solution satisfies $x > e^{c}$ for a specific positive integer $c$.
4.  **Concretize Requirements:** Explicitly require the reasoning for all substitutions and constraints as part of the solution process.
5.  **Ensure Interconnection:** Defining $k$ using $e$ depends on logs. The constraint $c$ interacts with the expected solution size derived from the logs. All elements tie back to solving the core log equation.

- Key manipulable elements: Number of nails, color usage limits, minimum colors required, symmetry or bilateral aspects (as hands are mentioned), additional constraints (e.g., positional rules per finger type).

Step 2
#Plan#:
- **Modify nail count and scope**: Extend from one hand to both hands, doubling nails to 10 (5 left + 5 right), increasing combinatorial complexity.
- **Introduce resource constraints**: Add that each polish color is limited (bottle sufficient for exactly two nails), introducing finite supply and requiring careful allocation.
- **Add symmetry constraint**: Require that corresponding fingers (e.g., both thumbs) cannot share the same color, adding interdependency between hands.
- **Adjust color minimum**: Keep ""at least three colors"" but imply it may align with the new constraints (e.g., with 10 nails and max 2 per color, min automatically ≥5—no need to change but adds reasoning depth).

1.  **Modify the Equation:** Change the conic section to an ellipse by introducing different coefficients (e.g., `a` and `b`) to make completing the square less symmetric and constrain solutions asymmetrically. Define new constants logically (like squaring existing parameters).
2.  **Add an Internal Constraint:** Introduce a relationship between `x` and `y` within the pair requirement. Require that `x` and `y` are coprime (`gcd(x, y) = 1`). This adds a significant number theory layer filtering potential integer solutions derived from the modified equation.
3.  **Add an External Constraint:** Introduce an additional congruence condition on one variable (e.g., `y ≡ 1 mod m`). Choose `m` such that it interacts meaningfully with the ellipse's geometry and the coprime condition, increasing backtracking/verification steps. Use a modulus like 3.
4.  **Justification:** The coprime condition forces checks based on divisibility and primeness relative to the solution pairs. The modulus condition (`y ≡ 1 mod 3`) uses the existing `4y` term as inspiration (`4 mod 3 = 1`), adds another divisibility hurdle, and constrains the valid `y`-values more tightly.

2. **Add constraints to variables**: Implicitly constrain the search space by focusing on all other permutations of [1,5] that match the signature, using the computed signature as input for the secondary task. This tests the user's ability to reverse-engineer signatures.  
3. **Enhance reasoning steps**: Introduce logical deduction by requiring the user to verify uniqueness (via enumeration or impossibility proof) and relate it to the preamble's concepts (unique/impossible signatures). This deepens understanding of signature properties.  
**Modification justification**:

*   **Variables:** Coordinates (x, y) of point R.
*   **Action:** Compute the number of possible ordered pairs (x, y) for R.
*   **Theme:** Coordinate geometry of a square defined by midpoints with integer coordinate constraints.

Step 2
**#Plan#:**
1.  **Generalize Fixed Points:** Replace having only point A fixed with having *two* points fixed (A and R), requiring both to satisfy the midpoint, lattice point, and quadrant conditions simultaneously. This intertwines constraints.
2.  **Increment Area Complexity:** Change the area from 650 to 625. 625 is a perfect square (25^2), introducing a potential ambiguity about the side length that requires consideration during solving.
3.  **Expand Midpoints Constraint:** Shift from specifying consecutive midpoints of a square to midpoints of consecutive sides of an *unspecified polygon*. Introduce ambiguity about the polygon's shape or the sequence of midpoints by stating it's ""a polygon"" rather than explicitly a square that must be deduced implicitly via the area given (implying it's a square).
4.  **Justification:** Adding a fixed R creates mutual dependencies between A and R. Changing to area 625 complicates the relationship between area and side length. The ""polygon"" phrasing forces verification that the area corresponds to a square rather than assuming it. R's quadrant shifts to III for different sign constraints. Lattice points remain key.

Step 3
**#Rewritten Instruction#:**
Points A(7,8) and R(x, y) are two consecutive midpoints of the sides of a polygon whose area is 625. Points M and L are subsequent consecutive midpoints. All points A, R, M, L are lattice points. Point R is located in Quadrant III. Compute the number of possible ordered pairs (x, y) for point R.

#Plan#:
1.  **Increase Dimension:** Change the base shape from a 3D cube to a 4D hypercube (`x, y, z, w`).
2.  **Generalize Shape:** Replace the unit hypercube ([0,1]^4) with a hyperrectangle defined by arbitrary intervals (`a_i ≤ coord_i ≤ b_i`), introducing parameters `a_x, b_x, a_y, b_y, a_z, b_z, a_w, b_w`.
3.  **Dynamize Distance Threshold:** Replace the constant threshold `3/5` with a parameter dependent on the adjacent coordinate intervals. Introduce `d_min = k * min(b_i - a_i)` where `k` is a constant `(0 < k < 1)`. Forcing `k` to be `3/10` explicitly would tie it back to the original structure albeit scaled.
4.  **Increase Subtlety:** Instead of removing points within `d_min` of *any* vertex, remove points within `d_min` of the *nearest* vertex, affecting how regions around different vertices interact. This requires identifying which vertex is closest for each point.
5.  **Maintain Coherence:** The hyperrectangle intervals directly affect both the distance calculation and the threshold `d_min`.

2.  **Make Flies Dynamic:** Change the fly population model. Instead of being static targets, flies reproduce exponentially at a constant rate ($R$) during the eating period, adding competition between consumption and growth. The number eaten is the initial count plus growth minus the ending count after the time period.

- $Q(x)$ is quadratic with leading coefficient 1, roots $r_1+1$ and $r_2+1$ (fixed shift by 1).

   (a) Sum of roots of $Q(x)$ equals product of roots of $P(x)$ (i.e., $(r_1+a) + (r_2+a) = r_1 r_2$).  
   (b) Constant term of $Q(x)$ is fixed to a new value (1000) to provide a solvable equation.

- Add asymmetry and reasoning by requiring the computation of a different expression that depends on a derived value: Instead of the original expression, compute \(\left[\mathcal{R}_{1}\right] - \left[\mathcal{R}_{4}\right] + k\) where \(k\) is the minimum area difference, but simplify to an expression like \(\left[\mathcal{R}_{1}\right] + \left[\mathcal{R}_{4}\right] - \left[\mathcal{R}_{2}\right] - \left[\mathcal{R}_{3}\right]\) for a new challenge.
- Ensure logical consistency: The lines must intersect inside the ellipse for valid partitioning, which holds for the chosen \(\frac{x^2}{25} + \frac{y^2}{9} = 1\) and lines \(2x - y = 0\), \(x + y = 5\) (intersection at (1,2) with \( \frac{1}{25} + \frac{4}{9} = 0.04 + 0.444 < 1 \)).

Step 2
**#Plan#**:
1.  **Modify $b_n$:** Change the geometric sequence's property itself. Instead of being purely geometric, assert it has a **minimum positive period of 5**, making $b_{n+5} = b_n$ for all $n$, while still maintaining $c_n=a_n+b_n$.
2.  **Modify $a_n$:** Introduce a **direct proportional relationship** between specific terms of $a_n$ and $b_n$. Require $b_k = k \cdot a_k$ for some $k$ (divergent from the given $c_n$ points).
3.  **Amplify Target:** Increase the required computation point from $c_5$ to $c_7$. The periodicity added in (1) makes $b_5$, $b_6$, $b_7$ depend on $b_0$, $b_1$, $b_2$ ($\equiv b_7$), requiring different solving logic compared to the smooth progression to $c_5$. Combining with the shift needed for (2) adds complexity.
4.  **Re-index $b_n$:** To make the period and proportionality constraint interact non-trivially, impose the proportionality $b_{k} = k \cdot a_{k}$ specifically for $k=0$ (a term before $n=1$). This forces consideration of $b_0$ and $a_0$, linking to the periodic condition $b_5 = b_0$.
5.  **Justify Connections:** The period of $b_n$ introduces cyclic dependencies (back to $b_0, b_1$). The $b_0 = 0 \cdot a_0$ constraint ($k=0$) links $a_0$ and $b_0$, creating a critical connection point between the sequences affecting all indices via $a_n$'s recursion and $b_n$'s periodicity. Targeting $c_7$ leverages the period ($b_7 = b_2$) and the impact of the $k=0$ constraint. All given $c_n$ values remain essential.

There are only 16 strings of four 0's and 1's. In addition, because 16 and 625 are relatively prime, it will be shown below that for each such string $s$, there exists exactly one integer $x_{s}$ in the range $0 \\leq x_{s}<10000$ such that the base- 2 and base- 5 representations of $x_{s}$ end in the digits of $s$ (e.g., $x_{1001}$ is the unique positive integer less than 10000 such that $x$ 's base- 5 representation and base- 2 representation both end in 1001).\n\nHere is a proof of the preceding claim: Let $p(s)$ be the number whose digits in base 5 are the string $s$, and $b(s)$ be the number whose digits in base 2 are the string $s$. Then the system $x \\equiv$ $p(s) \\bmod 625$ and $x \\equiv b(s) \\bmod 16$ can be rewritten as $x=p(s)+625 m$ and $x=b(s)+16 n$ for integers $m$ and $n$. These reduce to the Diophantine equation $16 n-625 m=p(s)-b(s)$, which has solutions $m, n$ in $\\mathbb{Z}$, with at least one of $m, n \\geq 0$. Assuming without loss of generality that $m>0$ yields $x=p(s)+625 m \\geq 0$. To show that there exists an $x_{s}<10000$ and that it is unique, observe that the general form of the solution is $m^{\\prime}=m-16 t, n^{\\prime}=n+625 t$. Thus if $p(s)+625 m>10000$, an appropriate $t$ can be found by writing $0 \\leq p(s)+625(m-16 t)<10000$, which yields $p(s)+625 m-10000<10000 t \\leq p(s)+625 m$. Because there are exactly 10000 integers in that interval, exactly one of them is divisible by 10000 , so there is exactly one value of $t$ satisfying $0 \\leq p(s)+625(m-16 t)<10000$, and set $x_{s}=625(m-16 t)$.\n\nTherefore there will be 16 integers whose base- 2 and base- 5 representations end in the same four digits, possibly with leading 0 's as in the example. Let $X=x_{0000}+\\cdots+x_{1111}$. Then $X$ is congruent modulo 16 to $0000_{2}+\\cdots+1111_{2}=8 \\cdot\\left(1111_{2}\\right)=8 \\cdot 15 \\equiv 8$. Similarly, $X$ is congruent modulo 625 to $0000_{5}+\\cdots+1111_{5}=8 \\cdot 1111_{5}=2 \\cdot 4444_{5} \\equiv 2 \\cdot(-1)=-2$.\n\nSo $X$ must be $8(\\bmod 16)$ and $-2(\\bmod 625)$.

3.  **Complexify the Expression Under Root:** Change the expression under the square root from a simple quadratic `(-x^2 - 2x + n)` to a rational function (ratio of polynomials).

#Elements Identified#:
*   **Target Integer:** A specific integer (\(2^{32} - 1\)), which factors relatively easily. This element can be modified to a more complex composite number.
*   **Factor Criteria:** Restriction to positive, two-digit factors. The specific constraint ""two-digit"" can be made more restrictive.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Modify the Target Integer:** Replace \(2^{32} - 1\) with a significantly harder number to factor completely: \(2^{32} \times 3^{16} - 1\). This introduces factors of 3 and requires handling a difference of powers pattern.
2.  **Add a Restrictive Factor Condition:** Keep the requirement for positive two-digit factors but add the constraint that the factors must be congruent to 7 modulo 8. This interlocks with properties found in factors of numbers like this and makes identification non-trivial.
3.  **Change the Core Operation & Add Processing:** Replace the summation with the calculation of the **product** of all qualifying factors. Additionally, require that the final answer is this product taken modulo 61, and then add 1 to that residue.
4.  **Justification:** All modifications increase complexity: a more difficult factorization task, a restrictive secondary filter on factors, the computational challenge of a large product (vs. sum), and a final modular reduction and increment that depends on the entire result.

#Elements Identified#:  
- Six solid regular tetrahedra with identical properties.  
- Bases form a regular hexagonal arrangement with fixed side length 1.  
- Apex vertices (vertices not on the base) are coplanar.  
- A spherical ball of radius \(r\) with center on the axis through the hexagon's center.

- Core task: Compute the numerical value of \(r\).  
- Theme: Symmetric 3D geometry involving polyhedra and tangency.  

### Step 2  
#Plan#:  
- **Add an additional tangency constraint**: Modify so that the sphere is also tangent to the flat base surface. This introduces an extra equation into the system and requires solving for tangency to both the edges and a separate plane.  
- **Change the sphere's position constraint**: Remove the coplanarity condition between the sphere's center and the apex vertices. Instead, position the sphere based solely on tangency (to the base and edges) to increase the problem's reliance on geometric reasoning without simplifying assumptions.  
- **Specify the type of edge for tangency**: Clarify that the tangent edge is a ""lateral edge"" (specifically, an edge connecting the apex to a base vertex, not a base edge) to eliminate ambiguity and add precision. Ensure this is consistent across the symmetric arrangement.  
Justification: This plan increases complexity by adding dependencies between variables (e.g., tangency to base affects center height) and requires deeper 3D reasoning. All elements are interconnected: The additional tangency and edge specificity build on the base/edge interactions, while removing coplanarity adds difficulty by reducing direct relations.

- **Participants**: Elizabeth performs flips.
- **Actions**: Flip switches (toggle state).
- **Process**: After each minute, check if all switches are on. $E(n,k)$ is the minimum time to escape or infinity if impossible.
- **Theme**: Deterministic state transitions to achieve a global ""on"" configuration.
- **Computation Example**: Specific case $E(6,1)$.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. **Introduce dynamic action constraints**: Replace fixed $k$ with a time-dependent sequence $\{k_t\}$ where $k_t$ cycles periodically, adding temporal variability.
2. **Add initial state variability**: Start with a random but specified initial binary state $S$ (not all off), increasing setup complexity.
3. **Incorporate action dependencies**: Force the flip set in minute $t$ to include a specific switch (e.g., switch $(t \mod n) + 1$), linking actions to time modulo $n$.
4. **Increase computational depth**: Require solving for multiple $(n, m, S)$ tuples, with $m$ defining the flip-sequence period.
5. **Ensure coherence**: All added elements interact logically; e.g., $k_t$ affects escape feasibility depending on $S$, and the forced switch ties flips to the clock cycle. Avoid breaking solvability or adding extraneous variables.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Modify Switch Behavior (Increase State Complexity)**: Instead of simple on/off, each switch has multiple states (e.g., Off -> Stage1 -> Stage2 -> ... -> On) or multiple contributing flips required. This breaks the simple $\mathbb{Z}_2$ model and adds linear algebra/combinatorial depth.
2.  **Modify Escape Condition (Increase Constraint Complexity)**: Escape requires not only all switches to be on, but also that a specific total number of flips has been performed on each switch within the minute they become on. This introduces critical timing dependencies between flips across minutes.
3.  **Modify the Locking Mechanism (Add Dynamic Constraint)**: A ""panic"" trigger is added: if the *exact* sequence of flip counts per switch over the last $t$ minutes matches a forbidden pattern derived from $n$ and $k$ ($t$ depends on $n$ and $k$), the door permanently locks. This introduces a dynamic, pattern-recognition constraint throughout the process.
4.  **Justification & Connection**: The modified switch behavior requires intricate planning since flipping affects not just it and its neighbors, but also its path to ""On"". The escape condition adds per-switch historical tracking and forces consideration of *when* flips occur relative to others. The panic trigger adds a constant dynamic threat based on recent flip sequences and depends critically on $n$ and $k$, forcing Elizabeth to avoid specific patterns derived from the problem parameters.

Because $k$ must be odd, $E(n, k)$ must be even. To show this, consider the case where $E(n, k)$ is odd. If $E(n, k)$ is odd, then an odd number of flips happen an odd number of times, resulting in an odd number of total flips. This is a contradiction because $n$ is even.\n\nCall a switch ""non-flipped"" in any given minute if it is not among the switches flipped in that minute. Because $E(n, k)$ (i.e., the total number of minutes) is even, and each switch is flipped an odd number of times, each switch must also be non-flipped an odd number of times. Therefore any sequence of flips that solves the "" $(n, k)$ puzzle"" can be made into a sequence of flips that solves the "" $(n, n-k)$ "" puzzle by interchanging flips and non-flips.

3001,"Elizabeth is in an ""escape room"" puzzle. She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle. The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off.

#Elements Identified#:
- Variables: $n$ (number of light switches), $k$ (number of switches flipped per minute), initial state (all off), and escape condition (all switches on after any minute).
- Conditions: Must flip exactly $k$ distinct switches each minute; flip toggles the state; $k \leq n$; puzzle may be impossible ($E(n,k)=\infty$).
- Actions: Flipping switches, changing states from off to on or on to off.
- Processes: Sequential minutes where actions are performed and state is checked; cumulative effect of flips over time.
- Theme: Combinatorial state-transition puzzle with modular arithmetic over GF(2), minimizing time to reach all-on state.

Step 2
#Plan#:
- **Modify actions**: Change the flipping action to include adjacency effects. Each flip affects the target switch and its immediate neighbors, introducing dependency (e.g., circular arrangement).
- **Add conditions**: Specify that switches are arranged in a circle, so adjacency wraps around (switch 1 adjacent to $n$ and 2, etc.), and each flip of switch $i$ toggles switches $i-1$, $i$, $i+1$ modulo $n$ (using 1-based indexing with modular arithmetic for neighbors).
- **Complexify processes**: Combine the per-minute constraint (flipping exactly $k$ switches) with the fact that initiated flips cause overlapping state changes, requiring the system to satisfy the all-on condition through a sequence of such operations with cumulative mod 2 effects. Remove specific examples to focus on the given parameters.
- **Ensure coherence**: Dependencies from adjacency make the problem analogous to solving a system over GF(2) with a circulant matrix structure, increasing complexity for large $n$ and $k$ like $2001$ and $501$. Maintain fixed $k$ and escape condition.

- **Theme**: Discrete state manipulation puzzle with an efficiency deviation calculation

Step 2
#Plan#:
- **Expand Action Component**: Modify the flipping action to include adjacency-based effects by introducing an undirected graph structure (switches as vertices, edges define adjacencies), where flipping a switch toggles its state and all adjacent switches. Specify this graph as a cycle to concretize the dependency and increase reasoning complexity.
- **Add New Constraint**: Incorporate that flipping any switch consumes one unit of energy per flip, and Elizabeth starts with finite energy $S = n^2$ units, adding a resource limitation that affects the sequence used for $E(n, k)$.
- **Enhance Escape Condition**: Require that all switches must remain on for at least one full minute after first achieving the all-on state to escape, adding temporal consistency to the goal. Combine these to ensure logical coherence: The graph structure affects state transitions, the energy constraint restricts flip choices per sequence, and the extended escape condition demands sustained solutions.

- **Coverage**: Each pair of students must appear together in exactly one selfie.  
- **Constraints**: Groups must be distinct, and the process ensures pairwise coverage.  
- **Theme**: Combinatorial design for exhaustive and unique pair coverage with variable group sizes.  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
1. Increase participants from 8 to 12 for a larger combinatorial space.  
2. Expand group sizes from {2, 3} to {2, 3, 4} to add variability and interdependence between group size choices.  
3. Change the optimization objective from minimizing the number of selfies to minimizing the total number of ""student appearances"" (sum of sizes of all selfies) to introduce a secondary minimization layer with real-world relevance (e.g., cost or logistical constraints).  
This plan ensures interconnected complexity: the modified group sizes affect both pair coverage efficiency and the new objective, requiring trade-offs in group selection. All elements remain logically consistent with the theme.

To give an example in which 12 selfies is possible, consider regular octagon $P_{1} P_{2} P_{3} P_{4} P_{5} P_{6} P_{7} P_{8}$. Each vertex of the octagon represents a student and each of the diagonals and sides of the octagon represents a pair of students. Construct eight triangles $P_{1} P_{2} P_{4}, P_{2} P_{3} P_{5}, P_{3} P_{4} P_{6}, \\ldots, P_{8} P_{1} P_{3}$. Each of the segments in the forms of $\\overline{P_{i} P_{i+1}}, \\overline{P_{i} P_{i+2}}, \\overline{P_{i} P_{i+3}}$ appears exactly once in these eight triangles.

Assume that the students took $x$ three-person selfies and $y$ two-person selfies. Each three-person selfie counts 3 pairs of student appearances (in a selfie), and each two-person selfie counts 1 pair of student appearances (in a selfie). Together, these selfies count $3 x+y$ pairs of student appearances. There are $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}8 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)=28$ pairs of student appearances. Hence $3 x+y=28$.

- **Conditions**: Dessert is optional, meaning choices include ""no dessert"".  
- **Participants**: Guests placing orders.  
- **Actions/Processes**: Selecting one appetizer from 7, one entrée from $K$, and deciding on dessert (choose from 2 options or none).  
- **Theme**: Combinatorics with optional items, focusing on counting meal combinations.  
- **Key Elements for Complexity Expansion**:  
  1. The optional dessert structure (simplistic; can be enhanced with dependencies).  
  2. Uniform entrée treatment (all entrées have identical dessert rules; can vary based on type).  
  3. No additional constraints or relationships (e.g., ratios between entrée categories can be added).  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
1. **Introduce dependency between entrée choice and dessert options** to make dessert rules conditional on entrée type, increasing reasoning steps: divide entrées into two categories based on dessert treatment.  
2. **Add a ratio constraint** between the entrée categories to require solving multiple equations, introducing variables $M$ (entrées with mandatory dessert) and $V$ (entrées with optional dessert), related by $M = \frac{1}{3}V$.

   - Ensure all components interconnect logically: Appetizer → Entrée type → Dessert decision → Total orders.  
   - Complexity increases by adding real-world constraints (e.g., meal bundling) and requiring algebraic manipulation.

4.   *Implicit Process*: Enumerate positive integers N satisfying the core condition, order them increasingly, select the 2011th.

Step 2
**#Plan#:**
1.   **Add a Modular Constraint:** Introduce a secondary condition: N must satisfy a specific congruence relation (N ≡ k mod m). This places periodic restrictions, requiring solutions to satisfy both the digit gain condition and lie within specific residue classes modulo m, increasing combinatorial complexity.
2.   **Add a Derived Value Constraint:** Require that when N is doubled, the result (2N) must pass a new test. Specifically, when the digits of 2N are reversed, the reversal must *also* satisfy the original core condition (i.e., doubling the reversal gains an extra digit).
3.   **Concretize k and m:** Set the modulus m = 9 (leveraging the divisible-by-9 property) and k = 7 (a non-zero residue modulo 9). This choice provides a non-trivial constraint connected to the digit-sum properties intrinsic to the doubling behavior and the reversal condition.

#Plan#:

2.  **Introduce Variable Dimensions:** Replace the fixed lengths AC = 5 and BC = 12 with variables (AC = a, BC = b) requiring the circle properties to hold generally. Replace the output requirement from a numerical value to an expression involving a, b, containing r.
3.  **Add Constraint on M:** Introduce a new constraint defining the position of M on AC. Use a proportional relationship: M divides AC in the ratio k:1. Require that the tangency conditions imply a specific relationship between k and r.
4.  **Shift Theme:** Change from computing a numerical radius to deriving an equation expressing k in terms of r, a, b.
5.  **Ensure Cohesive Integration:** The circle (center at M on AC) must be simultaneously tangent to all three lines (AB, BC, AC). The given lengths a (AC) and b (BC) define the right triangle ABC. The position M is defined by the ratio k:1 for AC=a, implicitly making AM = a*k/(k+1), MC = a/(k+1). The tangency constraints must be satisfied simultaneously given M, a, b, linking k and r.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. Add dependency on circumradius and angles: Introduce the circumcircle with radius $R$ for the polygon, and specify that $k$ is chosen such that the quadrilateral becomes a rectangle only when the central angles satisfy a specific ratio (e.g., the arc $A_k A_{k+1}$ subtends an angle three times that of $A_1 A_2$).
2. Add constraint on chord lengths: Include that the length of chord $A_1 A_k$ must be equal to the diameter of the circumcircle to reinforce geometric dependency.

4. Ensure all added elements are interconnected: The central angle ratio affects the rectangle formation; $A_1 A_k$ being diameter uses circumradius; the area relation ensures $R$ is determined from areas and angles.

- Composition \(f(f(x))\) has exactly one real zero at \(x = 5\).

- Potential modifications:  
  1. Increase ambiguity in the real zero condition (e.g., require an additional root or specify multiplicity).  
  2. Introduce calculus concepts (e.g., derivative constraints at the zero).

Theme: Finding \(f(0)\) by deducing coefficients of \(f(x)\) using given roots and composition properties.  

---

### Step 2  
**#Plan#:**  
1. **Amplify complexity of the zero condition**:  
   - Instead of simply having one real zero at \(x = 5\), explicitly require the root to be a **double root**, necessitating analysis of derivatives for multiplicity.  
2. **Introduce coefficient constraint**:  
   - Demand that \(f(x)\) is a **monic** polynomial (leading coefficient 1) to limit symmetry options and force integer coefficients in solutions.  
3. **Add a secondary point constraint**:  
   - Require \(f(0) = k\) for an added unknown \(k\), making \(f(0)\) a process variable to deduce rather than an endpoint. Replace ""compute \(f(0)\)"" with ""find the product of all possible values of \(f(0)\)"", increasing algebraic manipulation.  
- **Justification**:  
  - Step 1 ensures multiplicity analysis via derivatives, adding calculus.  
  - Step 2 imposes structure on \(f(x)\), removing freedom from the leading coefficient.  
  - Step 3 transforms \(f(0)\) from an endpoint into an intermediate variable, necessitating solving a system with multiple solutions and computing their product.

  - Monic condition links to coefficient deduction.

- Objective: maximize the common difference (d) first, then maximize the sum of the 15 answers for that d.  
- Theme: arithmetic progression within integer constraints.  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
1. Add a per-answer digit constraint: for each answer, the digits (hundreds, tens, units) must form an arithmetic progression themselves (i.e., 2 × tens = hundreds + units). This restricts the set of possible numbers and links the digit-level structure to the sequence-level progression.  
2. Reinforce the three-digit nature explicitly by specifying leading zeros, making the digit constraint more relevant and tangible.  
3. Introduce a dependency on the starting term: specify that the first term of the progression must be such that the units digit equals the question number for position 1 (mod 10), but since the sequence must fit within 000-999, this adds a numerical anchoring constraint.  
The plan increases complexity by adding interdependent constraints that reduce the solution space and require coordination between digit-level properties and sequence-level progression, with a real-world flavor of anchoring the sequence to the exam setup. All elements are logically connected: digit constraints limit valid numbers; the anchoring further restricts possible starting points; both impact the achievable common difference and sum.

- Add the constraint that the reversed polynomial has distinct real integer zeros (implying all zeros must be distinct for both polynomials).

- Participants: Two square tiles.

- Actions: Placed one directly on top of the other (centers aligned initially), rotation of top tile about its center.  
- Condition: Rotation by acute angle θ, area of overlap is 8.  
- Processes: Geometric overlap calculation involving rotation.  
- Goal: Compute sin θ + cos θ.  
- Theme: 2D geometry, trigonometry, area calculation for rotated squares.  

Step 2  
#Plan#:
1. Modify the placement action to include a fixed horizontal misalignment: Instead of centers perfectly aligned, specify that the top tile is offset horizontally by a distance d (set d=0.5 for concreteness) before rotation. This introduces a translation component, making the overlap area dependent on both d and θ.  
2. Increase geometric complexity by changing the tile shape: Replace both squares with rectangles (same area 9) to vary dimensions. Set specific dimensions (e.g., bottom tile has sides 2 and 4.5, top tile has sides 6 and 1.5) to ensure solvability while adding asymmetric aspect ratios.  
3. Enhance reasoning by adding a dependency: The overlapping area now depends on the offset, dimensions, and rotation, requiring a system of relationships. Keep the goal focused on sin θ + cos θ to maintain thematic consistency.  
- Justify: All changes are interconnected—misalignment and non-square dimensions demand more advanced area computation and trigonometric derivation, avoiding arbitrary variables (d and dimensions fixed to prevent underdetermination).

- Condition: Divisors must be perfect cubes (exponents in prime factorization divisible by $3$).
- Theme: Number theory involving divisors and perfect powers.

Step 2
#Plan#:
- Expand the base: Introduce an additional prime factor (e.g., $7$) with an exponent that depends on $T$ to increase the number of prime factors, adding complexity in exponent range handling.
- Modify exponents: Change fixed exponents to expressions with $T$ (e.g., $20^{T}$ instead of $20^{4}$, changing exponents to $2T$ for $2$ and $T$ for $5$, and $11$ to $2T$) to create interdependence and variable ranges.
- Add a constraint: Require divisors to be congruent to a specific value modulo a composite number (e.g., $1 \mod 12$) to incorporate modular arithmetic, increasing reasoning about prime residues and constraints on exponent choices.

*   **Operation:** Simple sum of two squared sine terms.
*   **Input:** Rational number `T`.
*   **Output:** Single closed-form expression or constant.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Modify Angle Arguments:** Replace single terms with sums/differences of angles and include coefficients. Replace `(Tπ)/2` with `(Tπ)/8` and `((5-T)π)/2` with `f(T)π` where `f(T)` is a rational function. Introduce at least two more distinct arguments.
2.  **Alter Core Expression & Process:** Instead of a direct sum, require composing functions: compute the value as a combination of two sub-expressions. These sub-expressions themselves involve trigonometric terms with transformations applied *after* squaring and summing.
3.  **Introduce Conditional Variable:** Introduce a new variable `β` defined as `β = (3T) mod 5`. Use the irrationality of β (or persistently rational nature of `T` modulo denominator) to determine which sub-expression to compute. Connect β to the domain constraint.
4.  **Add Domain Constraint:** Explicitly state `T` is modulo a rational denominator relevant to the periods involved (like 8 or 10) to handle periodicity, yet leverage β's irrationality based on `T`.
5.  **Output Modification:** Require simplification and evaluation of the combined expression from the chosen sub-expression.

Step 3
#Rewritten Instruction#:
Let T be a rational number. Define β = (3T) mod 5. Compute the expression E₁ = sin²(Tπ/8) + sin²((T+4)π/5) and E₂ = sin²(5Tπ/2) + sin(Tπ/5). Form Eᵦ = E₁ / |cos(βπ)| if β is irrational, otherwise form Eᵦ = √(E₂) / (1 + |sin(βπ)|). Simplify and evaluate Eᵦ.

3101,Let $T=11$. Compute the value of $x$ that satisfies $\sqrt{20+\sqrt{T+x}}=5$.,Let $T$ be the positive integer solution of \( T^{2} - 10T - 11 = 0 \). Compute the value of \( x \) satisfying \( \sqrt{ 2T - 2 + \sqrt{ T + \sqrt{x} } } = 5 \).,"**Step 1**  
#Elements Identified#:  
- Constant $T=11$ (fixed value).  
- Single nested square roots: $\sqrt{20 + \sqrt{T + x}} = 5$.  
- Solving for $x$ involves basic isolation and squaring steps.  
- Theme: Solving a nested radical equation with one parameter.  

**Step 2**  
#Plan#:  
1. **Introduce variable dependency**: Redefine $T$ using an equation (quadratic) instead of a fixed value, requiring solving for $T$ first.  
2. **Increase nesting depth**: Add a third nested radical layer by modifying $\sqrt{T + x}$ to $\sqrt{T + \sqrt{x}}$.  
3. **Parameterize constants**: Replace the outer constant ""20"" with an expression involving $T$ ($2T - 2$ to maintain solvability and connection to $T$).  
4. **Maintain logical flow**: Sequence steps: Solve quadratic for $T$, substitute into the new nested radical equation ($\sqrt{2T - 2 + \sqrt{T + \sqrt{x}}} = 5$), then solve for $x$.  
5. **Ensure solvability**: The quadratic admits $T=11$ as a solution (as in the original), and the final equation yields an integer $x$.

Compute the values of `n`, `k`, and `m`.","Step 1
#Elements Identified#:
*   **Variable:** `n` (sides of the unknown polygon).
*   **Fixed Polygons:** Pentagon (5 sides), Octagon (8 sides).
*   **Key Condition:** Equality of sum of interior angles: Sum(Int(n)) = Sum(Int(5)) + Sum(Int(8)).
*   **Underlying Concept:** Formula for sum of interior angles: `S = (n - 2) * 180°`.
*   **Theme:** Relating the properties (interior angle sums) of different polygons through a linear equation.
*   **Participants:** Abstract polygons defined by their number of sides.
*   **Action:** Compute the value of `n` based on the equality.
*   **Structure:** Direct equation setup and solution.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Replace Fixed Polygons with Variables:** Substitute the pentagon and octagon with variables `k` and `m` (numbers of sides). This adds two unknowns.
2.  **Introduce Modular Constraint on `n`:** Add a condition that `n ≡ 2 mod 3`. This adds a dependency on `n` that must be satisfied simultaneously.
3.  **Add Constraints and Concretize:**
    *   Define that `k` and `m` are distinct integers.
    *   Impose bounds: `3 < k ≤ 10` and `3 < m ≤ 10` (ensuring simple polygons).
    *   Specify that all polygons (`k`, `m`, `n`) must satisfy the standard interior angle sum formula for convex polygons.
    *   Require determining the specific values of `k`, `m`, and `n`.
4.  **Increase Reasoning:** The solver must now:
    *   Establish the equation `(n - 2) * 180 = (k - 2) * 180 + (m - 2) * 180` and simplify it to `n = k + m - 2`.
    *   Use the bounds on `k` and `m` to find possible pairs `(k, m)` such that `n = k + m - 2`.
    *   Check the derived `n` against the constraint `n ≡ 2 mod 3`.
    *   Identify the pair(s) `(k, m)` and `n` that satisfy all conditions.
5.  **Ensure Interconnection:** The bounds for `k`/`m` restrict valid `n` values derived from `n = k + m - 2`. The modular condition `n ≡ 2 mod 3` then filters these possible `n` values. The polygon formula constrains `k`, `m`, `n` to integers > 2.
