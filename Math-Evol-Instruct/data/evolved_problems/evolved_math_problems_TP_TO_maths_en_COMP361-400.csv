**#Elements Identified#**:  
- **Function and Iteration**: The function \(f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\) and its iterate \(f^m\) applied \(m\) times, where the original involves \(f^{2k}\).  
- **Key Condition**: For every \(n \in \mathbb{N}\), there exists a minimal \(k_n \in \mathbb{N}\) such that \(f^{2k}(n) = n + k\).  
- **Sequence Objective**: The sequence of minimal values \(k_1, k_2, \ldots\) must be proven unbounded.  
- **Theme**: Unbounded growth in iterative function dynamics, driven by the requirement that advancing \(n\) by \(k\) in \(2k\) steps forces larger minimal iterations for larger \(n\).  

### Step 2  
**#Plan#**:  
1. **Enhance Application Count Complexity**: Replace the linear term \(2k\) in the exponent with a quadratic term \(k^2\) so that \(f^{k^2}(n)\) is applied, making the iteration count scale faster and non-linearly.  
2. **Modify the Shift Term**: Change the shift from \(n + k\) to \(n + k^2\), introducing a quadratic advance and increasing computational difficulty in verifying the equation.  
3. **Add Function Constraint**: Impose bijectivity on \(f\) (i.e., \(f\) must be a bijection) to ensure invertibility and inject complexity through inverse function properties.  
4. **Specify Computational Output**: Instead of proving unboundedness for an abstract sequence, demand the computation of \(k_n\) for a specific large \(n = 10^6\), which requires concrete iteration or algorithmic derivation.  
5. **Ensure Coherence**: The modifications interconnect: bijectivity ensures \(f\) is well-structured, \(k^2\) increases computational load exponentially, and the large \(n = 10^6\) necessitates non-trivial numerical methods or optimized computation.

We can assume for all $i$ that $a_{i, n}=\\max \\left\\{a_{i, 1}, \\ldots, a_{i, n}\\right\\}$ and $a_{m, n}=\\min \\left\\{a_{1, n}, \\ldots, a_{m, n}\\right\\}$. The left-hand side is $=a_{m, n}$ and hence we need to prove the same for the right-hand side. If $\\left(j_{1}, j_{2}, \\ldots, j_{m}\\right)=(n, n, \\ldots, n)$ then $\\min \\left\\{a_{1, j_{1}}, \\ldots, a_{m, j_{m}}\\right\\}=\\min \\left\\{a_{1, n}, \\ldots, a_{m, n}\\right\\}=a_{m, n}$ which implies that the right-hand side is $\\geq a_{m, n}$.

If $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{r}$ are metapolynomials, assume them defined with the same $m$ and $n$. Then\n\n$$\nf=\\max \\left\\{f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{r}\\right\\}=\\max \\left\\{\\max _{i \\in[m]} \\min _{j \\in[n]} P_{i, j}^{1}, \\ldots, \\max _{i \\in[m]} \\min _{j \\in[n]} P_{i, j}^{r}\\right\\}=\\max _{s \\in[r], i \\in[m]} \\min _{j \\in[n]} P_{i, j}^{s}\n$$\n\nIt follows that $f=\\max \\left\\{f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{r}\\right\\}$ is a metapolynomial. The same argument works for the minima, but first we have to replace $\\min \\max$ by $\\max \\min$, and this is done via the lemma.\n\nAnother property we need is that if $f=\\max \\min P_{i, j}$ is a metapolynomial then so is $-f$. Indeed, $-f=\\min \\left(-\\min P_{i, j}\\right)=\\min \\max P_{i, j}$.\n\nTo prove $\\mathcal{M}$ is closed under addition let $f=\\max \\min P_{i, j}$ and $g=\\max \\min Q_{i, j}$.

In general the product of the maxima of two sets is not equal\n\n\n\nto the maximum of the product of the sets. We need to deal with the fact that $a<b$ and $c<d$ do not imply $a c<b d$. However this is true for $a, b, c, d \\geq 0$.\n\nIn view of this we decompose each function $f(x)$ into its positive part $f^{+}(x)=\\max \\{f(x), 0\\}$ and its negative part $f^{-}(x)=\\max \\{0,-f(x)\\}$ . Note that $f=f^{+}-f^{-}$ and $f^{+}, f^{-} \\in \\mathcal{M}$ if $f \\in \\mathcal{M}$. The whole problem reduces to the claim that if $f$ and $g$ are metapolynomials with $f, g \\geq 0$ then $f g$ it is also a metapolynomial.\n\nAssuming this claim, consider arbitrary $f, g \\in \\mathcal{M}$. We have\n\n$$\nf g=\\left(f^{+}-f^{-}\\right)\\left(g^{+}-g^{-}\\right)=f^{+} g^{+}-f^{+} g^{-}-f^{-} g^{+}+f^{-} g^{-},\n$$\n\nand hence $f g \\in \\mathcal{M}$. Indeed, $\\mathcal{M}$ is closed under addition, also $f^{+} g^{+}, f^{+} g^{-}, f^{-} g^{+}, f^{-} g^{-} \\in \\mathcal{M}$ because $f^{+}, f^{-}, g^{+}, g^{-} \\geq 0$.\n\nIt remains to prove the claim. In this case $f, g \\geq 0$, and one can try to repeat the argument for the sum. More precisely, let $f=\\max \\min P_{i j} \\geq 0$ and $g=\\max \\min Q_{i j} \\geq 0$. Then\n\n$$\nf g=\\max \\min P_{i, j} \\cdot \\max \\min Q_{i, j}=\\max \\min P_{i, j}^{+} \\cdot \\max \\min Q_{i, j}^{+}=\\max \\min P_{i_{1}, j_{1}}^{+} \\cdot Q_{i_{2}, j_{2}}^{+}\n$$\n\nHence it suffices to check that $P^{+} Q^{+} \\in \\mathcal{M}$ for any pair of polynomials $P$ and $Q$. This reduces to the identity\n\n$$\nu^{+} v^{+}=\\max \\left\\{0, \\min \\{u v, u, v\\}, \\min \\left\\{u v, u v^{2}, u^{2} v\\right\\}, \\min \\left\\{u v, u, u^{2} v\\right\\}, \\min \\left\\{u v, u v^{2}, v\\right\\}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nwith $u$ replaced by $P(x)$ and $v$ replaced by $Q(x)$. The formula is proved by a case-by-case analysis. If $u \\leq 0$ or $v \\leq 0$ then both sides equal 0 . In case $u, v \\geq 0$, the right-hand side is clearly $\\leq u v$.

#Plan#:  
1. Increase dimensionality: Change the grid to $m \times m$ with $m$ not necessarily divisible by 3, forcing adaptations in coloring and token counts, but ensure $m$ relates to $k$ colors and token distribution.  
2. Generalize colors: Introduce $k$ colors (e.g., asparagus, byzantium, citrine for $k=3$, and shade names for higher $k$), with coloring based on $(x+y) \pmod{k}$.  
3. Add computational complexity: Require computing the minimal $d$ for the initial cyclic permutation under specific constraints, and ensure it's by adding a cost function—minimum total Manhattan distance for tokens in a given initial placement.  
4. Introduce asymmetry: Set different row/column sizes ($m \times n$ grid) to disrupt symmetry, complicating distance calculations.  
5. Integrate dependent constraint: Force the initial token placement to satisfy the cyclic permutation condition with a minimal max distance $d$, and compute the minimal max distance for color-matching directly.  

Step 3  
#Rewritten Instruction#:  
The rows and columns of an $m \times n$ grid ($m = k a$, $n = k b$ for integers $a \geq 2$, $b \geq 2$, $k \geq 2$) are numbered from 1 to $m$ and 1 to $n$. Each square $(x, y)$ is colored with one of $k$ colors based on the value of $(x+y) \pmod{k}$. Tokens of each color are placed, with counts proportional to the color frequencies. Given an initial token placement that admits a permutation where each token moves Manhattan distance at most $d$ to replace the next color in a cycle (e.g., color $i$ replaces color $i+1 \pmod{k}$), and for fixed $k, a, b$, and $d$, compute the minimal possible maximum Manhattan distance over all permutations that match each token to a square of its own color.

This means we need a perfect matching between the $3 n^{2} \\mathrm{~A}$-squares and the $3 n^{2} \\mathrm{~A}$-tokens such that the distance in each pair of the matching is at most $d+2$.\n\nTo find the matching, we construct a bipartite graph. The A-squares will be the vertices in one class of the graph; the vertices in the other class will be the A-tokens.\n\nSplit the board into $3 \\times 1$ horizontal triminos; then each trimino contains exactly one Asquare. Take a permutation $\\pi$ of the tokens which moves A-tokens to B-tokens, B-tokens to C-tokens, and C-tokens to A-tokens, in each case to a distance at most $d$. For each A-square $S$, and for each A-token $T$, connect $S$ and $T$ by an edge if $T, \\pi(T)$ or $\\pi^{-1}(T)$ is on the trimino containing $S$. We allow multiple edges; it is even possible that the same square and the same token are connected with three edges. Obviously the lengths of the edges in the graph do not exceed $d+2$. By length of an edge we mean the distance between the A-square and the A-token it connects.\n\nEach A-token $T$ is connected with the three A-squares whose triminos contain $T, \\pi(T)$ and $\\pi^{-1}(T)$. Therefore in the graph all tokens are of degree 3 . We show that the same is true for the A-squares. Let $S$ be an arbitrary A-square, and let $T_{1}, T_{2}, T_{3}$ be the three tokens on the trimino containing $S$. For $i=1,2,3$, if $T_{i}$ is an A-token, then $S$ is connected with $T_{i}$; if $T_{i}$ is a B-token then $S$ is connected with $\\pi^{-1}\\left(T_{i}\\right)$; finally, if $T_{i}$ is a C-token then $S$ is connected with $\\pi\\left(T_{i}\\right)$. Hence in the graph the A-squares also are of degree 3.\n\nSince the A-squares are of degree 3 , from every set $\\mathcal{S}$ of A-squares exactly $3|\\mathcal{S}|$ edges start. These edges end in at least $|\\mathcal{S}|$ tokens because the A-tokens also are of degree 3. Hence every set $\\mathcal{S}$ of A-squares has at least $|\\mathcal{S}|$ neighbors among the A-tokens.\n\nTherefore, by HALL's marriage theorem, the graph contains a perfect matching between the two vertex classes. So there is a perfect matching between the A-squares and A-tokens with edges no longer than $d+2$. It follows that the tokens can be permuted as specified in the problem statement.""]"

#Plan#:
1. **Modify the objective to computational**: Instead of proving Ben can win for $n \geq 2^k$, require calculation of a specific minimum value. Specifically, fix $n = 2^k$ (since the proof guarantees win at this size) and shift focus to minimizing the number of questions $M$.
2. **Introduce constraints on questions**: Add a limit $M$ on the number of questions Ben can ask, forcing optimization of query efficiency. This adds a real-world resource constraint.
3. **Increase dependencies and complexity**: Require calculation of the minimum $M$ (questions) as a function of $k$ and $N$, which involves recursive or combinatorial reasoning due to the adversarial setting and lying pattern.
4. **Ensure coherence**: Maintain the core game, variables ($k$, $n$, $x$, $N$), and lying constraint. Connections: $M$ depends on both $k$ (lies) and $N$ (search space), with $n$ fixed to $2^k$ for minimax optimality.

It follows that $A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}$ and $C^{\\prime}$ are independent of the choice of $D, E$ and $F$, as stated.\n\nWe use the lemma two more times with $\\angle B A C=\\alpha$. Let $\\omega$ be the circle with diameter $A I$. Then $X$ and $Y$ are the tangency points of the incircle of $A B C$ with $A B$ and $A C$, and hence $A X=A Y=\\frac{1}{2}(A B+A C-B C)$. So the lemma yields $2 A I \\cos \\frac{\\alpha}{2}=A B+A C-B C$. Next, if $\\omega$ is the circumcircle of $A B C$ and $A I$ intersects $\\omega$ at $M \\neq A$ then $\\{X, Y\\}=\\{B, C\\}$, and so $2 A M \\cos \\frac{\\alpha}{2}=A B+A C$ by the lemma. To summarize,\n\n$$\n2 A A^{\\prime} \\cos \\frac{\\alpha}{2}=B C, \\quad 2 A I \\cos \\frac{\\alpha}{2}=A B+A C-B C, \\quad 2 A M \\cos \\frac{\\alpha}{2}=A B+A C\n\\tag{*}\n$$\n\nThese equalities imply $A A^{\\prime}+A I=A M$, hence the segments $A M$ and $I A^{\\prime}$ have a common midpoint. It follows that $I$ and $A^{\\prime}$ are equidistant from the circumcenter $O$. By symmetry $O I=O A^{\\prime}=O B^{\\prime}=O C^{\\prime}$, so $I, A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}, C^{\\prime}$ are on a circle centered at $O$.\n\nTo prove $O P=O I$, now it suffices to show that $I, A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}, C^{\\prime}$ and $P$ are concyclic. Clearly one can assume $P \\neq I, A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}, C^{\\prime}$.\n\nWe use oriented angles to avoid heavy case distinction. The oriented angle between the lines $l$ and $m$ is denoted by $\\angle(l, m)$. We have $\\angle(l, m)=-\\angle(m, l)$ and $\\angle(l, m)+\\angle(m, n)=\\angle(l, n)$ for arbitrary lines $l, m$ and $n$. Four distinct non-collinear points $U, V, X, Y$ are concyclic if and only if $\\angle(U X, V X)=\\angle(U Y, V Y)$.\n\n\n\n<img_3948>\n\nSuppose for the moment that $A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}, P, I$ are distinct and noncollinear; then it is enough to check the equality $\\angle\\left(A^{\\prime} P, B^{\\prime} P\\right)=\\angle\\left(A^{\\prime} I, B^{\\prime} I\\right)$. Because $A, F, P, A^{\\prime}$ are on the circle $\\omega_{A}$, we have $\\angle\\left(A^{\\prime} P, F P\\right)=\\angle\\left(A^{\\prime} A, F A\\right)=\\angle\\left(A^{\\prime} I, A B\\right)$. Likewise $\\angle\\left(B^{\\prime} P, F P\\right)=\\angle\\left(B^{\\prime} I, A B\\right)$. Therefore\n\n$$\n\\angle\\left(A^{\\prime} P, B^{\\prime} P\\right)=\\angle\\left(A^{\\prime} P, F P\\right)+\\angle\\left(F P, B^{\\prime} P\\right)=\\angle\\left(A^{\\prime} I, A B\\right)-\\angle\\left(B^{\\prime} I, A B\\right)=\\angle\\left(A^{\\prime} I, B^{\\prime} I\\right) .\n$$\n\nHere we assumed that $P \\neq F$. If $P=F$ then $P \\neq D, E$ and the conclusion follows similarly (use $\\angle\\left(A^{\\prime} F, B^{\\prime} F\\right)=\\angle\\left(A^{\\prime} F, E F\\right)+\\angle(E F, D F)+\\angle\\left(D F, B^{\\prime} F\\right)$ and inscribed angles in $\\left.\\omega_{A}, \\omega_{B}, \\omega_{C}\\right)$.\n\nThere is no loss of generality in assuming $A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}, P, I$ distinct and noncollinear. If $A B C$ is an equilateral triangle then the equalities (*) imply that $A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}, C^{\\prime}, I, O$ and $P$ coincide, so $O P=O I$. Otherwise at most one of $A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}, C^{\\prime}$ coincides with $I$. If say $C^{\\prime}=I$ then $O I \\perp C I$ by the previous reasoning. It follows that $A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime} \\neq I$ and hence $A^{\\prime} \\neq B^{\\prime}$.

It follows that the prime factorization of $2^{n} y+1$ consists of the prime powers $p_{1}^{e_{1}}, \\ldots, p_{r}^{e_{r}}$ and powers of primes $\\equiv 1(\\bmod 4)$.

2169,Prove that for every prime $p>100$ and every integer $r$ there exist two integers $a$ and $b$ such that $p$ divides $a^{2}+b^{5}-r$.,"For a given prime \( p > 100 \), compute the number of integer pairs \( (a,b) \) with \( a, b \in \{1, 2, \dots, p-1\} \) such that \( \gcd(a,b) = 1 \) and \( a^{2} + b^{5} \) is divisible by \( p \).","Step 1  
#Elements Identified#:  
- Variables: Prime \( p > 100 \), integer \( r \), integers \( a \) and \( b \).  
- Conditions: \( p \) divides \( a^{2} + b^{5} - r \) (i.e., \( a^{2} + b^{5} \equiv r \pmod{p} \)).  
- Action: Prove existence of \( a \) and \( b \) for every such \( p \) and \( r \).  
- Theme: Number theory involving residues modulo a large prime, with a focus on representation by polynomials (specifically, quadratic and fifth powers) ensuring surjectivity of the map.  
- Key manipulations: Primality of \( p \), unbounded \( a \) and \( b \), arbitrary \( r \), existence of solutions for congruence.  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
- Change action from existence proof to computational problem: Instead of proving existence, compute the number of solutions, requiring concrete numerical output.  
- Modify participants and constraints: Add the condition \( \gcd(a, b) = 1 \) to introduce a coprimality constraint, increasing difficulty through multiplicative number theory (e.g., involving Euler's totient function and character sums).  
- Increase concretization and reasoning: Restrict the domain to \( a, b \in \{1, 2, \dots, p-1\} \) for unambiguous counting and to handle representative residues. Set \( r = 0 \) to focus on the count modulo \( p \) with a fixed residue, emphasizing representation of specific cases (i.e., when the expression equals a multiple of \( p \)).  
- Logically interconnect: The coprimality ties into polynomial evaluations via properties of residues; restricting to positive residues ensures computability; solving for \( r = 0 \) maintains the core polynomial theme while demanding efficient computation of solutions under constraints.  
- Increment complexity: By adding the \( \gcd \) condition, the problem requires handling character sums and correlations between quadratic and fifth-power residues modulo \( p \), which is computationally intensive for large \( p \) and avoids trivial estimates. The output is a specific large number for given \( p \), requiring advanced tools like Weil bounds.

Hence, there are $p-1$ suitable pairs $(a, c)$.\n\nThus, for each of the $k$ pairs $(b, d)$ with $b^{5} \\equiv d^{5}$ there are $2 p-1$ pairs $(a, c)$, and for each of the other $p^{2}-k$ pairs $(b, d)$ there are $p-1$ pairs $(a, c)$.

- **Initial fantabulous number**: Given as 2021, serving as the starting point for propagation.  
- **Target for inquiry**: The number $2021^{2021}$, to be evaluated for the fantabulous property.  
- **Structure**: A proof-based question asking for a logical determination (yes/no) about the fantabulous status of $2021^{2021}$ based on the rule and initial value.  
- **Theme**: Propagation of a mathematical property through linear operations on integers, rooted in number theory concepts.  

### Step 2

1. **Modify the set definition to increase complexity**: Change the set from $\{m, 2m+1, 3m\}$ to $\{m, 3m-1, 2m+1\}$ to introduce asymmetric operations (coefficients 3 and 2 with mixed signs). This adds complexity through more varied transformations, affecting the propagation behavior.  
2. **Introduce multiple initial fantabulous numbers to create interdependencies**: Replace the single initial number 2021 with multiple initial values (e.g., 5, 11, and 2021). This requires handling confluence and potential conflicts in property propagation.  
3. **Transform from proof to computational demand**: Instead of asking for a fantabulous status proof, require computation of a specific numerical value—here, the number of fantabulous numbers less than or equal to $2021^{2021}$. This demands enumeration under complex growth conditions, leveraging combinatorial or dynamical systems reasoning.  
4. **Ensure logical coherence and increased difficulty**: The new set $\{m, 3m-1, 2m+1\}$ and multiple initials interact non-trivially; computations must account for reachability, denseness, and exponential bounds ($N=2021^{2021}$).

We show this inductively.\n\nIf there are no lines, this is obvious. Consider now an arrangement of $n$ lines in the plane and an alternating 2 -coloring of the regions. If we add a line $g$, we can simply switch the colors of all regions in one of the half planes divided by $g$ from white to black and vice versa.

To visit the same segment of $\\ell$, she must cross every other line an even number of times.'
 'Let us color in red all intersection points of the given lines and let us choose one of two possible directions on each segment (draw an arrow on each segment). Consider a red point $R$ where two given lines $a$ and $b$ meet, and the four segments $a_{1}, a_{2}, b_{1}, b_{2}$ with endpoint $R$ (so that $a_{i} \\subset a, b_{j} \\subset b$ ). $R$ is called a saddle if on $a_{1}, a_{2}$ the arrows go out of $R$ while on $b_{1}, b_{2}$ the arrows enter $R$, or visa versa, on $b_{1}, b_{2}$ the arrows go out of $R$ while on $a_{1}, a_{2}$ the arrows enter $R$. The set of arrows (chosen on all segments) is said to be good if all red points are saddles. It is sufficient to prove that there exists a good set of arrows. Indeed, if initially Turbo is moving along (or opposite) the arrow, then this condition holds after she turns at a red point.\n\nThe given lines cut the plane into regions. Further we need the following property of the good set of arrows (this property directly follows from the definition): the boundary of any bounded region is a directed cycle of arrows; the boundary of any unbounded region is a directed chain of arrows.\n\nWe construct a good set of arrows by induction on $n$ with trivial base $n=1$. Now erase one of $n$ given lines and assume we have a good set of arrows for remaining $n-1$ lines. Now restore the $n$-th line $\\ell$, assume that $\\ell$ is horizontal. Denote by $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{n-1}$ all new red points on $\\ell$ from the left to the right. Each of $A_{i}$ belongs to some old segment $m_{i}$ of the line $\\ell_{i}$. Let us call $A_{i}$ ascending if the arrow on $m_{i}$ goes up, and descending if the arrow on $m_{i}$ goes down. Consider the region containing the segment $A_{i} A_{i+1}$. By the property, $A_{i}$ and $A_{i+1}$ can not be both ascending or both descending. Thus we can choose arrows on all pieces of $\\ell$ so that each arrow goes from a descending to an ascending vertex.\n\n\n\nEach of points $A_{i}$ cuts $m_{i}$ into two new pieces; the direction of new pieces supposed to be the same as on $m_{i}$. Now simultaneously change the direction of arrows on all pieces below the line $\\ell$. It is easy to see that $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{n-1}$ become saddles, while the other red points remain saddles. This completes the induction step.']"

It thus remains to show that they coincide.\n\nTo show that, for example, $X_{1}^{\\prime}=X_{2}^{\\prime}$, it will be sufficient to show that $\\angle X_{2} A C=\\angle X_{1}^{\\prime} A C$, since we have already shown that $X_{1}^{\\prime}$ and $X_{2}^{\\prime}$ lie on the circumcircle of $A B C$.

This shows that $X_{1}^{\\prime}=X_{2}^{\\prime}$. Similarly, $X_{1}^{\\prime}=X_{3}^{\\prime}$, which completes the proof.'

Given \(AB = 3\), \(BC = 4\), \(CD = 5\), \(DE = 6\), and \(EF = 7\), find the length of \(FA\).",success,157.43,"['Denote the angle bisector of $A$ by $a$ and similarly for the other bisectors. Thus, given that $a, c, e$ have a common point $M$, we need to prove that $b, d, f$ are concurrent. We write $\\angle(x, y)$ for the value of the directed angle between the lines $x$ and $y$, i.e. the angle of the counterclockwise rotation from $x$ to $y\\left(\\right.$ defined $\\left.\\left(\\bmod 180^{\\circ}\\right)\\right)$.\n\nSince the sum of the angles of a convex hexagon is $720^{\\circ}$, from the angle conditions we get that the sum of any two consecutive angles is equal to $240^{\\circ}$. In particular, it now follows that $\\angle(b, a)=\\angle(c, b)=\\angle(d, c)=\\angle(e, d)=\\angle(f, e)=\\angle(a, f)=60^{\\circ}$ (assuming the hexagon is clockwise oriented).\n\nLet $X=A B \\cap C D, Y=C D \\cap E F$ and $Z=E F \\cap A B$. Similarly, let $P=B C \\cap D E, Q=D E \\cap F A$ and $R=F A \\cap B C$. From $\\angle B+\\angle C=240^{\\circ}$ it follows that $\\angle(Z X, X Y)=\\angle(B X, X C)=60^{\\circ}$. Similarly we have $\\angle(X Y, Y Z)=\\angle(Y Z, Z X)=60^{\\circ}$, so triangle $X Y Z$ (and similarly triangle $P Q R)$ is equilateral. We see that the hexagon $A B C D E F$ is obtained by intersecting the two equilateral triangles $X Y Z$ and $P Q R$.\n\nWe have $\\angle(A M, M C)=\\angle(a, c)=\\angle(a, b)+\\angle(b, c)=60^{\\circ}$, and since\n\n$$\n\\angle(A M, M C)=\\angle(A X, X C)=\\angle(A R, R C)=60^{\\circ} \\text {, }\n$$\n\n$A, C, M, X, R$ are concyclic. Because $M$ lies on the bisector of angle $\\angle X A R$, we must have $M R=M X$, so triangle $M R X$ is isosceles. Moreover, we have $\\angle(M R, M X)=\\angle(C R, C X)=$ $\\angle(B C, C D)$, which is angle $C$ of the hexagon. We now see that the triangles $M R X, M P Y$ and $M Q Z$ are isosceles and similar. This implies that there is a rotation centered at $M$ that sends $X, Y$ and $Z$ to $R, P$ and $Q$ respectively. In particular, the equilateral triangles $X Y Z$ and $P Q R$ are congruent.\n\nIt follows that there also exists a rotation sending $X, Y, Z$ to $P, Q, R$ respectively. Define $N$ as the center of this rotation. Triangles $N X Z$ and $N P R$ are congruent and equally oriented, hence $N$ is equidistant from $X Z$ and $P R$ and lies on the inner bisector $b$ of $\\angle B$ (we know $N$ lies on the inner, not the outer bisector because the rotation centered at $N$ is clockwise). In the same way we can show that $N$ is on $d$ and on $f$, so $b, d, f$ are concurrent at $N$.\n\nRemark. The key observation (a rotation centered at $M$ sends $\\triangle X Y Z$ to $\\triangle R Q P$ ) can be established in slightly different ways. E.g., since $A, M, R, X$ are concyclic and $A, M, Q, Z$ are concyclic, $M$ is the Miquel point of the lines $X Z, R Q, X R, Z Q$, hence it is the center of similitude $s$ sending $\\overrightarrow{X Z}$ to $\\overrightarrow{R Q}$. Repeating the same argument for the other pairs of vectors, we obtain that $s$ sends $\\triangle X Y Z$ to $\\triangle R Q P$. Moreover, $s$ is a rotation, since $M$ is equidistant from $X Z$ and $R Q$.\n\nRemark. The reverse argument can be derived in a different way, e.g., defining $N$ as the common point of the circles $B X P D, D Y Q F, F Z R B$, and showing that $\\triangle N X Z=\\triangle N P R$, etc.\n\n\n\n<img_3291>'
 'We prove that the hexagon $A B C D E F$ is the intersection of the equilateral triangles $P Q R$ and $X Y Z$.\n\nLet $d(S, A B)$ denote the signed distance from the point $S$ to the line $A B$, where the negative sign is taken if $A B$ separates $S$ and the hexagon. We define similarly the other distances $(d(S, B C)$, etc). Since $M \\in a$, we have $d(M, Z X)=d(M, Q R)$. In the same way, we have $d(M, X Y)=d(M, R P)$ and $d(M, Y Z)=d(M, P Q)$. Therefore $d(M, Z X)+d(M, X Y)+$ $d(M, Y Z)=d(M, Q R)+d(M, R P)+d(M, P Q)$.\n\nWe now use of the following well-known lemma (which can be easily proved using areas) to deduce that triangles $P Q R$ and $X Y Z$ are congruent.\n\nLemma. The sum of the signed distances from any point to the sidelines of an equilateral triangle (where the signs are taken such that all distances are positive inside the triangle) is constant and equals the length of the altitude.\n\nFor $N=b \\cap d$ we now find $d(N, Z X)=d(N, R P)$ and $d(N, X Y)=d(N, P Q)$. Using again the lemma for the point $N$, we get $d(N, Z X)+d(N, X Y)+d(N, Y Z)=d(N, Q R)+d(N, R P)+$ $d(N, P Q)$. Therefore $d(N, Y Z)=d(N, Q R)$, thus $N \\in f$.\n\nRemark.

 ""We use the the same notations as in previous solutions and the fact that $a \\| d$, $b \\| e$ and $c \\| f$ make angles of $120^{\\circ}$. Also, we may assume that $E$ and $C$ are not symmetric in $a$ (if they are, the entire figure is symmetric and the conclusion is immediate).\n\nWe consider two mappings: the first one $s: a \\rightarrow B C \\rightarrow d$ sending $A^{\\prime} \\mapsto B^{\\prime} \\mapsto S$ is defined such that $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} \\| A B$ and $B^{\\prime} S \\| b$, and the second one $t: a \\rightarrow E F \\rightarrow d$ sending $A^{\\prime} \\mapsto F^{\\prime} \\mapsto T$ is defined such that $A^{\\prime} F^{\\prime} \\| A F$ and $F^{\\prime} T \\| f$. Both maps are affine linear since they are compositions of affine tranformations. We will prove that they coincide by finding two distinct points $A^{\\prime}, A^{\\prime \\prime} \\in a$ for which $s\\left(A^{\\prime}\\right)=t\\left(A^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $s\\left(A^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)=t\\left(A^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$. Then we will obtain that $s(A)=t(A)$, which by construction implies that the bisectors of $\\angle B, \\angle D$ and $\\angle F$ are concurrent.\n\nWe will choose $A^{\\prime}$ to be the reflection of $C$ in $e$ and $A^{\\prime \\prime}$ to be the reflection of $E$ in $c$. They are distinct since otherwise $C$ and $E$ would be symmetric in $a$. Applying the above maps $a \\rightarrow B C$ and $a \\rightarrow E F$ to $A^{\\prime}$, we get points $B^{\\prime}$ and $F^{\\prime}$ such that $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C D E F^{\\prime}$ satisfies the problem statement. However, this hexagon is symmetric in $e$, hence the bisectors of $\\angle B^{\\prime}, \\angle D, \\angle F^{\\prime}$ are concurrent and $s\\left(A^{\\prime}\\right)=t\\left(A^{\\prime}\\right)$. The same reasoning yields $s\\left(A^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)=t\\left(A^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$, which finishes the solution.\n\nRemark. This solution is based on the fact that that two specific affine linear maps coincide. Here it was proved by exhibiting two points where they coincide. One could prove it in another way, exhibiting one such point and proving that the 'slopes' are equal.\n\nRemark. There are similar solutions where claims and proofs could be presented in more 'elementary' terms. For example, an elementary reformulation of the 'slopes' being equal is: if $b^{\\prime}$ passes through $B^{\\prime}$ parallel to $b$, and $f^{\\prime}$ passes through $F^{\\prime}$ parallel to $f$, then the line through $b \\cap f$ and $b^{\\prime} \\cap f^{\\prime}$ is parallel to $a$ (which is parallel to $d$ ).\n\nRemark. Circles $\\omega_{a}, \\omega_{c}$ and $\\omega_{e}$ could be helpful in some other solutions. In particular, the movement of $A$ along $a$ in current solution is equivalent to varying $r_{a}$.""
 'We use the same notations as in previous solutions.\n\nSince the sum of the angles of a convex hexagon is $720^{\\circ}$, from the angle conditions we get $\\angle B+\\angle C=720^{\\circ} / 3=240^{\\circ}$. From $\\angle B+\\angle C=240^{\\circ}$ it follows that the angle between $c$ and $b$ equals $60^{\\circ}$. The same is analogously true for other pairs of bisectors of neighboring angles.\n\nConsider the points $O_{a} \\in a, O_{c} \\in c, O_{e} \\in e$, each at the same distance $d^{\\prime}$ from $M$, where $d^{\\prime}>\\max \\{M A, M C, M E\\}$, and such that the rays $A O_{a}, C O_{c}, E O_{e}$ point out of the hexagon. By construcion, $O_{a}$ and $O_{c}$ are symmetrical in $e$, hence $O_{a} O_{c} \\perp b$. Similarly, $O_{c} O_{e} \\perp d, O_{e} O_{a} \\perp f$.

It follows that rays $O_{a} B_{a}$ and $O_{c} B_{c}$ (being symmetrical in $e$ ) intersect at $U_{e} \\in e$ forming an isosceles triangle $\\triangle O_{a} U_{e} O_{c}$. Similarly define $\\triangle O_{c} U_{a} O_{e}$ and $\\triangle O_{e} U_{c} O_{a}$. These triangles are congruent (equal bases and corresponding angles).

#Elements Identified#:
- Permutations of integers: The permutations are of the integers $1,2,\ldots,m$.
- Freshness condition: A permutation is fresh if no initial segment of length $k$ (for $k < m$) is a permutation of $\{1,2,\ldots,k\}$ in any order.
- Counting function: $f_m$ is defined as the number of fresh permutations for size $m$.
- Inequality: The instruction requires proving that $f_n \geq n \cdot f_{n-1}$ holds for all $n \geq 3$.
- Example: Provided to illustrate fresh and non-fresh permutations (e.g., for $m=4$). 
- Theme: Combinatorial counting with recursive properties or inequalities, focusing on prefix-avoiding permutations.

Key components to manipulate for complexity:
  - Variables: $m$ (size of permutation), $k$ (prefix length).
  - Conditions: The freshness condition based on prefixes. 
  - Actions: Proving an inequality involving the count of fresh permutations.
  - Processes: Recursive relationships in the count $f_m$.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. Add a combinatorial constraint: Introduce an additional requirement for the permutation to be a derangement (no fixed points) to increase combinatorial complexity. This creates a new counting function (e.g., $g_m$ for fresh derangements).
2. Change the problem type: Transform the proof-based inequality problem into a specific numerical computation requiring a modular answer for a large $n$ (e.g., $n=15$) to ensure non-trivial calculation. This involves recursive or dynamic programming techniques.
3. Compute modulo a large number: Add the constraint of finding the answer modulo $1000000007$ to handle large values and add computational difficulty.
4. Justify complexity increases: 
   - Adding the derangement constraint combines two non-trivial combinatorial concepts (prefix avoidance and fixed-point avoidance), deepening reasoning.
   - Setting $n=15$ ensures the computation is infeasible by hand, requiring algorithmic insight.
   - Using modulo arithmetic adds programming or large-number handling for realism.

Modifications ensure all elements are interconnected:
  - The derangement condition ties into the freshness property (e.g., avoids cases where fixed points might trivialize prefixes).
  - Large $n$ and modulus prevent direct enumeration and demand optimized recurrence use.
  - Theme remains combinatorial counting but with increased computational depth.

*   Triangle ABC with $\angle BCA > 90^{\circ}$, circumcircle $\Gamma$, radius $R$.
*   Point P on AB s.t. $PB = PC$ and $PA = R$.
*   Perpendicular bisector of PB intersecting $\Gamma$ at D and E.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Concretize & Add Constraint:** Set a fixed length for $BC$ (e.g., $BC = 5$) and impose an additional constraint (e.g., minimize $\angle CEP$). This forces solving specific equations and finds a numerical instance.
2.  **Complex Variables & Goal:** Replace the proof goal with a complex numerical computation. Express coordinates using the circumcircle center $O$ and properties, requesting the *minimum area* of triangle $CDE$ under the constraint.
3.  **Add Dependency:** Introduce a secondary variable $S$ (area of CDE) and require computation of a complex integer expression ($RS|_{\text{min}}$) where $R$ is intricately linked to the setup.
4.  **Ensure Cohesion:** Maintain the obtuse angle condition, PB=PC, PA=R. Establish P's position relative to O. Ensure the minimized angle and coordinate definitions depend on the fixed $BC$ and core constraints. The computation involves solving for R, coordinates of key points, and optimizing under the constraint without solving quadratics.

It is well-known that the incentre is the intersection of the angle bisector segment $C M$ and the circle with centre at $M$ and passing through $D, E$. We will verify this property for $P$.\n\n<img_4013>\n\nBy the conditions we have $A P=O A=O B=O C=O D=O E=R$. Both lines $O M$ and $A P B$ are perpendicular to $E D$, therefore $A P \\| O M$; in the quadrilateral $A O M P$ we have $A P=O A=A M=R$ and $A P \\| O M$, so $A O M P$ is a rhombus and its fourth side is $P M=R$. In the convex quadrilateral $O M B P$ we have $O M \\| P B$, so $O M B P$ is a symmetric trapezoid; the perpendicular bisector of its bases $A O$ and $P B$ coincide. From this symmetry we obtain $M D=O D=R$ and $M E=O E=R$. (Note that the triangles $O E M$ ad $O M D$ are equilateral.) We already have $M P=M D=M E=R$, so $P$ indeed lies on the circle with center $M$ and passing through $D, E$. (Notice that this circle is the reflection of $\\Gamma$ about $D E$.)\n\nFrom $P B=P C$ and $O B=O C$ we know that $B$ and $C$ are symmetrical about $O P$; from the rhombus $A O M P$ we find that $A$ and $M$ are also symmetrical about $O P$. By reflecting the collinear points $B, P, A$ (with $P$ lying in the middle) we get that $C, P, M$ are collinear (and $P$ is in the middle). Hence, $P$ lies on the line segments $C M$.'
 'Let $X$ be the second intersection of $C P$ with $\\Gamma$. Using the power of the point $P$ in the circle $\\Gamma$ and the fact that $P B=P C$, we find that $P X=P A=R$. The quadrilateral $A O X P$ has four sides of equal length, so it is a rhombus and in particular $O X$ is parallel to $A P$. This proves that $O X B P$ is a trapezoid, and because the diagonals $P X$ and $O B$ have equal length, this is even an isosceles trapezoid. Because of that, $D E$ is not only the perpendicular bisector of $P B$, but also of $O X$.\n\n<img_3704>\n\nIn particular we have $X D=X P=X O=X E=R$, which proves that $X$ is the middle of the arc $D E$ and $P$ belongs to the circle with center $X$ going through $D$ and $E$. These properties, together with the fact that $C, P, X$ are collinear, determine uniquely the incenter of $C D E$.'
 'Let $Y$ be the circumcenter of triangle $B P C$. Then from $Y B=Y P$ it follows that $Y$ lies on $D E$ (we assume $D$ lies in between $Y$ and $E$ ), and from $Y B=Y C$ it follows that $Y$ lies on $O P$, where $O$ is the center of $\\Gamma$.\n\nFrom $\\angle A O C=2 \\angle A B C=\\angle A P C$ (because $\\angle P B C=\\angle P C B)$ we deduce that $A O P C$ is a cyclic quadrilateral, and from $A P=R$ it follows that $A O P C$ is an isosceles trapezoid.

We can now finish the proof by angle chasing.\n\nFrom $A B \\perp D E$ we have $\\angle A O D+\\angle B O E=180^{\\circ}$ and from $\\angle D O E=2 \\angle D A E=120^{\\circ}$ it follows that $\\angle B O D+\\angle B O E=120^{\\circ}$. It follows that $\\angle A O D-\\angle B O D=180^{\\circ}-120^{\\circ}=60^{\\circ}$. Let $\\angle O A B=\\angle O B A=2 \\beta$; then $\\angle A O D+\\angle B O D=\\angle A O B=180^{\\circ}-4 \\beta$. Together with $\\angle A O D-\\angle B O D=60^{\\circ}$, this yields $\\angle A O D=120^{\\circ}-2 \\beta$ and $\\angle B O D=60^{\\circ}-2 \\beta$.

*   **Set Definition:** `A = {1 + 1/k for k = 1, 2, 3, ...}`
*   **Core Function:** `f(x)` defined as the minimum number of factors from set `A` needed to multiply together to get the integer `x` (for `x >= 2`).
*   **Key Property:** Submultiplicativity gap: `f(xy) < f(x) + f(y)`.**
*   **Core Task:** Prove the existence of infinitely many distinct pairs `(x, y)` with `x >= 2, y >= 2` exhibiting this submultiplicativity gap.
*   **Theme:** Multiplicative factorization using elements from the specific set `A` and deviations from additivity of the factorization length function `f`.

Step 2
**#Plan#**:
1.  **Introduce a Parameter & Constraint (n):** Instead of arbitrary pairs `(x, y)`, fix a large integer `n` (e.g., `n = 10^9`). Require the pairs `(x, y)` to satisfy `x * y = n`. This forces all pairs to share a common product.
2.  **Add Optimization & Specific Calculation:** Change the task from proving *existence* to finding the *maximum possible value* of the gap `g = f(x) + f(y) - f(xy)` over all valid pairs `(x, y)` for the fixed `n`.
3.  **Concretize & Add Complexity:** Specify a very large `n` (`n = 10^9`) requiring significant computation for `f` and exploration of factors. To prevent trivial solutions where `x = 1` or `y = 1` (which would violate `x,y >=2`), impose the **coprimality condition** `gcd(x, y) = 1`. This introduces necessary number theory and increases solution uniqueness complexity.

#Elements Identified#:  
- **Variables**: Number of contestants \(n\), initial queue permutation (order chosen by Jury).  
- **Conditions**: Move requires contestant \(C_i\) to have at least \(i\) others in front.  
- **Actions**: Jury selects \(i\) repeatedly; \(C_i\) moves forward \(i\) positions and pays 1 euro if condition met; process ends if condition fails.  
- **Participants**: Named contestants \(C_1, \ldots, C_n\).  
- **Theme**: Unlimited Jury moves under specific constraints; no constraints on sequence of \(i\) choices.  
- **Proof Goal**: Show finiteness for all possible scenarios.  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
1. **Modify payment scheme**: Change payment per move from 1 euro to contestant-dependent \(i\) euros (paid by \(C_i\)), increasing computational goal weight.  
2. **Add real-world constraint**: Jury cannot consecutively choose the same \(i\), limiting strategies and increasing decision complexity.  
3. **Shift goal to computational**: Require total maximum euros (not just move count) for a large \(n\) (spanning state-space explosion).  
4. **Ensure coherence**: Maintain original queue rules and varied move conditions; new constraints logically interact (e.g., higher-value moves influenced by repetition prevention).  
5. **Target difficult computation**: For \(n=6\), task requires calculating an optimal path over \(6!\) permutations and sequences including repetition constraints and payment weights, targeting large manual computation.

Let us assume that the Jury can collect $M_{n}$ euros in a configuration with $n$ contestants. Then we show that the Jury can collect at least $2 M_{n}+n$ moves in a configuration with $n+1$ contestants. Indeed, let us begin with all the contestants lined up in reverse order. In the first $M_{n}$ moves the Jury keeps $C_{n+1}$ in first position and reverses the order of the remaining contestants, then in the next $n$ moves all contestants $C_{1}, \\ldots, C_{n}$ (in this order) jump over $C_{n+1}$ and end up in the first $n$ positions of the line in reverse order, and finally in the last $M_{n}$ moves the Jury rearranges the first $n$ positions.\n\nSince $M_{1}=0$ and $M_{n+1} \\geq 2 M_{n}+n$, an easy induction shows that $M_{n} \\geq 2^{n}-n-1$.\n\n<img_3565>\n\nLet us show now that at most $2^{n}-n-1$ moves are possible. To this end, let us identify a line of contestants with a permutation $\\sigma$ of $\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$. To each permutation we associate the set of reverse pairs\n\n$$\nR(\\sigma):=\\{(i, j): 1 \\leq i<j \\leq n \\text { and } \\sigma(i)>\\sigma(j)\\}\n$$\n\nand the nonnegative integer\n\n$$\nW(\\sigma):=\\sum_{(i, j) \\in R(\\sigma)} 2^{i}\n$$\n\nwhich we call the total weight of the permutation. We claim that the total weight decreases after any move of the contestants. Indeed, let us assume that $C_{i}$ moves forward in the queue, let $\\sigma$ be the permutation before the move, and let $\\sigma^{\\prime}$ denote the permutation after the move. Since $C_{i}$ jumps over exactly $i$ contestants, necessarily she jumps over at least one contestant $C_{j}$ with index\n\n\n\n$j>i$. This means that the pair $(i, j)$ is reverse with respect to $\\sigma$ but not with respect to $\\sigma^{\\prime}$, and this yields a reduction of $2^{i}$ in the total weight. On the other hand, the move by $C_{i}$ can create new reverse pairs of the form $(k, i)$ with $k<i$, but their total contribution is at most\n\n$$\n2^{0}+2^{1}+\\ldots+2^{i-1}=2^{i}-1\n$$\n\nIn conclusion, when passing from $\\sigma$ to $\\sigma^{\\prime}$, at least one term $2^{i}$ disappears from the computation of the total weight, and the sum of all the new terms that might have been created is at most $2^{i}-1$. This shows that $W\\left(\\sigma^{\\prime}\\right) \\leq W(\\sigma)-1$.'
 'the previous solution, the fundamental observation is again that, when a contestant $C_{i}$ moves forward, necessarily she has to jump over at least one contestant $C_{j}$ with $j>i$.\n\nLet us show now that the process ends after a finite number of moves. Let us assume that this is not the case. Then at least one contestant moves infinitely many times. Let $i_{0}$ be the largest index such that $C_{i_{0}}$ moves infinitely many times. Then necessarily $C_{i_{0}}$ jumps infinitely many times over some fixed $C_{j_{0}}$ with $j_{0}>i_{0}$. On the other hand, we know that $C_{j_{0}}$ makes only a finite number of moves, and therefore she can precede $C_{i_{0}}$ in the line only a finite number of times, which is absurd.\n\nIn order to estimate from above the maximal number of moves, we show that the contestant $C_{i}$ can make at most $2^{n-i}-1$ moves. Indeed, let us argue by ""backward extended induction"". To begin with, we observe that the estimate is trivially true for $C_{n}$ because she has no legal move.\n\nLet us assume now that the estimate has been proved for $C_{i}, C_{i+1}, \\ldots, C_{n}$, and let us prove it for $C_{i-1}$. When $C_{i-1}$ moves, at least one contestant $C_{j}$ with $j>i-1$ must precede her in the line. The initial configuration can provide at most $n-i$ contestants with larger index in front of $C_{i-1}$, which means at most $n-i$ moves for $C_{i-1}$. All other moves are possible only if some contestant in the range $C_{i}, C_{i+1}, \\ldots, C_{n}$ jumps over $C_{i-1}$ during her moves. As a consequence, the total number of moves of $C_{i-1}$ is at most\n\n$$\nn-i+\\sum_{k=i}^{n}\\left(2^{n-k}-1\\right)=2^{n-i+1}-1\n$$\n\nSumming over all indices we obtain that\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(2^{n-i}-1\\right)=2^{n}-n-1\n$$\n\nwhich gives an estimate for the total number of moves.\n\n\nComment In every move of the example, the moving contestant jumps over exactly one contestant with larger index (and as a consequence over all contestants with smaller index).']"

Prove that for every real number $t$ such that $0<t<\frac{1}{2}$ there exists a positive integer $n$ with the following property: for every set $S$ of $n$ positive integers there exist two different elements $x$ and $y$ of $S$, and a non-negative integer $m$ (i.e. $m \geq 0$ ), such that

#Elements Identified#:
- Real parameter: $t$ in $(0, \frac{1}{2})$
- Positive integer: $n$ (size of set $S$)
- Set $S$ of $n$ positive integers
- Two distinct elements: $x, y \in S$
- Non-negative integer: $m \geq 0$
- Condition: $|x - m y| \leq t y$
- Core theme: Combinatorial number theory with a focus on Diophantine approximation and multiplicative structure.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. Replace the existential query with a specific, complex computational problem.
   - Fix $t = \frac{1}{4}$ (a non-trivial value within the domain) to eliminate the generalized $t$.
   - Restrict $S$ to the set $\{1, 2, \dots, M\}$ for a large $M$ (specifically $M = 1000$) to impose concrete bounds, converting the problem to finite combinatorial optimization.
   - Instead of existence, ask for the maximum size $\ell$ of a subset $T \subseteq \{1, \dots, 1000\}$ that *avoids* the condition, so $\ell$ must be computed. This reframes the proof into finding $\ell$ such that every larger subset must satisfy the property, requiring explicit computation.
2. Introduce real-world constraints to increase complexity:
   - Demand that the subset maximization avoids the condition for *all* pairs $(x,y)$ and *all* $m$, forcing combinatorial explosion. The condition must be checked for every unordered pair and potential multiples when $x \geq y$, and the bound $M=1000$ ensures brute force is infeasible.
3. Maintain logical flow: The output is the specific integer $\ell$, which requires advanced combinatorial arguments or algorithms due to the multiplicative constraint $|x - m y| \leq \frac{y}{4}$ and the check over $m$. This problem is harder because the proof guarantees existence but does not provide tools for exact finite computation.

Step 3
#Rewritten Instruction#:
For $t = \frac{1}{4}$, what is the largest integer $\ell$ such that there exists a subset $T$ of $\{1, 2, \dots, 1000\}$ of size $\ell$ with no two distinct $x, y \in T$ and non-negative integer $m$ satisfying $|x - m y| \leq t y$? Provide $\ell$.

Step 4
#Finally Rewritten Instruction#:
For $t = \frac{1}{4}$, find the size of the largest subset $T$ of $\{1, 2, \dots, 1000\}$ such that for all distinct $x, y \in T$ and all non-negative integers $m$, $|x - m y| > \frac{y}{4}$.",success,206.87,"[""Let $n$ be any positive integer such that\n\n$$\n(1+t)^{n-1} \\geq \\frac{1}{t} \\tag{Q6.1}\n$$\n\n(this inequality is actually true for every large enough $n$ due to Bernoulli's inequality).\n\nLet $S$ be any set of $n$ distinct positive integers, which we denote by\n\n$$\ns_{1}<s_{2}<\\ldots<s_{n}\n$$\n\nWe distinguish two cases.\n\n- If $s_{i+1} \\leq(1+t) s_{i}$ for some $i \\in\\{1, \\ldots, n-1\\}$, then\n\n$$\n\\left|s_{i+1}-s_{i}\\right|=s_{i+1}-s_{i} \\leq t s_{i}\n$$\n\nand therefore the required inequality is satisfied with $x=s_{i+1}, y=s_{i}$, and $m=1$.\n\n- If $s_{i+1}>(1+t) s_{i}$ for every $i \\in\\{1, \\ldots, n-1\\}$, then by induction we obtain that\n\n$$\ns_{n}>(1+t)^{n-1} s_{1}\n$$\n\nAs a consequence, from (Q6.1) it follows that\n\n$$\n\\left|s_{1}\\right|=s_{1}<\\frac{1}{(1+t)^{n-1}} \\cdot s_{n} \\leq t s_{n}\n$$\n\nand therefore the required inequality is satisfied with $x=s_{1}, y=s_{n}$, and $m=0$.""]"
