Preamble. Let $X=y \cap z, Y=x \cap z, Z=x \cap y$ and let $\Omega$ denote the circumcircle of the triangle $X Y Z$. Denote by $X_{0}, Y_{0}$, and $Z_{0}$ the second intersection points of $A I, B I$ and $C I$, respectively, with $\omega$. It is known that $Y_{0} Z_{0}$ is the perpendicular bisector of $A I, Z_{0} X_{0}$ is the perpendicular bisector of $B I$, and $X_{0} Y_{0}$ is the perpendicular bisector of $C I$. In particular, the triangles $X Y Z$ and $X_{0} Y_{0} Z_{0}$ are homothetic, because their corresponding sides are parallel.

The solutions below mostly exploit the following approach. Consider the triangles $X Y Z$ and $X_{0} Y_{0} Z_{0}$, or some other pair of homothetic triangles $\Delta$ and $\delta$ inscribed into $\Omega$ and $\omega$, respectively. In order to prove that $\Omega$ and $\omega$ are tangent, it suffices to show that the centre $T$ of the homothety taking $\Delta$ to $\delta$ lies on $\omega$ (or $\Omega$ ), or, in other words, to show that $\Delta$ and $\delta$ are perspective (i.e., the lines joining corresponding vertices are concurrent), with their perspector lying on $\omega$ (or $\Omega$ ).

Then $i_{r}=n-1$ and $i_{r-1}=n-2$, for if $n-1$ or $n-2$ is missing from the sequence $i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{r}$, then $a_{i_{1}}+\\cdots+a_{i_{r}} \\leqslant a_{0}+\\cdots+a_{n-3}+a_{n-1}=S_{n-1}-a_{n-2}<a_{n}$.

So we proved that, if $2 m+1$ is good, then $2^{2 m}$ is representable. Conversely, if $2^{2 m}$ is representable, then $2^{2 m}<a_{2 m}$, so $2^{2 m}$ is a sum of some distinct terms $a_{i}$ with $i<2 m$. It follows that $a_{2 m+1}=a_{2 m}+2^{2 m}$ writes as $a_{2 m}$ plus a sum of some distinct terms $a_{i}$ with $i<2 m$. Hence $2 m+1$ is good.\n\nIf $n=2 m+2$, then $a_{n}-a_{n-1}-a_{n-2}=a_{2 m+2}-a_{2 m+1}-a_{2 m}=\\left(2^{2 m+2}+2^{m+1}\\right)-\\left(2^{2 m+1}+\\right.$ $\\left.2^{m}\\right)-\\left(2^{2 m}+2^{m}\\right)=2^{2 m}$. So we proved that, if $2 m+2$ is good, then $2^{2 m}$ is representable. Conversely, if $2^{2 m}$ is representable, then, as seen in the previous case, it writes as a sum of some distinct terms $a_{i}$ with $i<2 m$. Hence $a_{2 m+2}=a_{2 m+1}+a_{2 m}+2^{2 m}$ writes as $a_{2 m+1}+a_{2 m}$ plus a sum of some distinct terms $a_{i}$ with $i<2 m$. Thus $2 m+2$ is good.\n\nLemma 2. If $k \\geqslant 2$, then $2^{4 k-2}$ is representable if and only if $2^{k+1}$ is representable.\n\nIn particular, if $s \\geqslant 2$, then $4^{s}$ is representable if and only if $4^{4 s-3}$ is representable. Also, $4^{4 s-3}>4^{s}$.\n\nProof. We have $2^{4 k-2}<a_{4 k-2}$, so in a representation of $2^{4 k-2}$ we can have only terms $a_{i}$ with $i \\leqslant 4 k-3$. Notice that\n\n$$\na_{0}+\\cdots+a_{4 k-3}=2^{4 k-2}+2^{2 k}-3<2^{4 k-2}+2^{2 k}+2^{k}=2^{4 k-2}+a_{2 k} .\n$$\n\nHence, any representation of $2^{4 k-2}$ must contain all terms from $a_{2 k}$ to $a_{4 k-3}$. (If any of these terms is missing, then the sum of the remaining ones is $\\leqslant\\left(a_{0}+\\cdots+a_{4 k-3}\\right)-a_{2 k}<2^{4 k-2}$.) Hence, if $2^{4 k-2}$ is representable, then $2^{4 k-2}-\\sum_{i=2 k}^{4 k-3} a_{i}$ is representable. But\n\n$2^{4 k-2}-\\sum_{i=2 k}^{4 k-3} a_{i}=2^{4 k-2}-\\left(S_{4 k-3}-S_{2 k-1}\\right)=2^{4 k-2}-\\left(2^{4 k-2}+2^{2 k}-3\\right)+\\left(2^{2 k}+2^{k+1}-3\\right)=2^{k+1}$.\n\nSo, if $2^{4 k-2}$ is representable, then $2^{k+1}$ is representable. Conversely, if $2^{k+1}$ is representable, then $2^{k+1}<2^{2 k}+2^{k}=a_{2 k}$, so $2^{k+1}$ writes as a sum of some distinct terms $a_{i}$ with $i<2 k$. It follows that $2^{4 k-2}=\\sum_{i=2 k}^{4 k-3} a_{i}+2^{k+1}$ writes as $a_{4 k-3}+a_{4 k-4}+\\cdots+a_{2 k}$ plus the sum of some distinct terms $a_{i}$ with $i<2 k$. Hence $2^{4 k-2}$ is representable.\n\nFor the second statement, if $s \\geqslant 2$, then we just take $k=2 s-1$ and we notice that $2^{k+1}=4^{s}$ and $2^{4 k-2}=4^{4 s-3}$. Also, $s \\geqslant 2$ implies that $4 s-3>s$.\n\nNow $4^{2}=a_{2}+a_{3}$ is representable, whereas $4^{6}=4096$ is not. Indeed, note that $4^{6}=2^{12}<a_{12}$, so the only available terms for a representation are $a_{0}, \\ldots, a_{11}$, i.e., $2,3,6,10,20,36,72$, 136, 272, 528, 1056, 2080. Their sum is $S_{11}=4221$, which exceeds 4096 by 125 . Then any representation of 4096 must contain all the terms from $a_{0}, \\ldots, a_{11}$ that are greater that 125, i.e., $136,272,528,1056,2080$. Their sum is 4072 . Since $4096-4072=24$ and 24 is clearly not representable, 4096 is non-representable as well.\n\nStarting with these values of $m$, by using Lemma 2, we can obtain infinitely many representable powers of 4 , as well as infinitely many non-representable ones. By Lemma 1, this solves our problem.']"

A proper coloring of the resulting graph in $n$ colors still exists: one may preserve the colors of the original vertices and color the vertex $I^{\\prime}$ in a color $k+1(\\bmod n)$ if the vertex $I$ has color $k$. Then two connected original vertices still have different colors, and so do their two connected copies. On the other hand, the vertices $I$ and $I^{\\prime}$ have different colors since $n>1$.\n\nAll the degrees of the vertices in the resulting graph are odd, so one may apply operation $(i)$ to delete consecutively all the vertices of color $n$ one by one; no two of them are connected by an edge, so their degrees do not change during the process. Thus, we obtain a graph admitting a proper coloring in $n-1$ colors, as required. The lemma is proved.\n\nNow, assume that a graph $G$ has $n$ vertices; then it admits a proper coloring in $n$ colors. Applying repeatedly the lemma we finally obtain a graph admitting a proper coloring in one color, that is - a graph with no edges, as required.'
 'Again, we will use the graph language.\n\nI. We start with the following observation.\n\nLemma. Assume that a graph $G$ contains an isolated vertex $A$, and a graph $G^{\\circ}$ is obtained from $G$ by deleting this vertex. Then, if one can apply a sequence of operations which makes a graph with no edges from $G^{\\circ}$, then such a sequence also exists for $G$.\n\nProof. Consider any operation applicable to $G^{\\circ}$ resulting in a graph $G_{1}^{\\circ}$; then there exists a sequence of operations applicable to $G$ and resulting in a graph $G_{1}$ differing from $G_{1}^{\\circ}$ by an addition of an isolated vertex $A$. Indeed, if this operation is of type $(i)$, then one may simply repeat it in $G$.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, the operation is of type (ii), and one may apply it to $G$ and then delete the vertex $A^{\\prime}$ (it will have degree 1).\n\nThus one may change the process for $G^{\\circ}$ into a corresponding process for $G$ step by step.\n\nIn view of this lemma, if at some moment a graph contains some isolated vertex, then we may simply delete it; let us call this operation (iii).\n\nII. Let $V=\\left\\{A_{1}^{0}, \\ldots, A_{n}^{0}\\right\\}$ be the vertices of the initial graph. Let us describe which graphs can appear during our operations. Assume that operation (ii) was applied $m$ times. If these were the only operations applied, then the resulting graph $G_{n}^{m}$ has the set of vertices which can be enumerated as\n\n$$\nV_{n}^{m}=\\left\\{A_{i}^{j}: 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n, 0 \\leqslant j \\leqslant 2^{m}-1\\right\\},\n$$\n\nwhere $A_{i}^{0}$ is the common ""ancestor"" of all the vertices $A_{i}^{j}$, and the binary expansion of $j$ (adjoined with some zeroes at the left to have $m$ digits) ""keeps the history"" of this vertex: the $d$ th digit from the right is 0 if at the $d$ th doubling the ancestor of $A_{i}^{j}$ was in the original part, and this digit is 1 if it was in the copy.\n\nNext, the two vertices $A_{i}^{j}$ and $A_{k}^{\\ell}$ in $G_{n}^{m}$ are connected with an edge exactly if either (1) $j=\\ell$ and there was an edge between $A_{i}^{0}$ and $A_{k}^{0}$ (so these vertices appeared at the same application of operation (ii)); or (2) $i=k$ and the binary expansions of $j$ and $\\ell$ differ in exactly one digit (so their ancestors became connected as a copy and the original vertex at some application of $(i i))$.\n\nNow, if some operations $(i)$ were applied during the process, then simply some vertices in $G_{n}^{m}$ disappeared. So, in any case the resulting graph is some induced subgraph of $G_{n}^{m}$.\n\nIII. Finally, we will show that from each (not necessarily induced) subgraph of $G_{n}^{m}$ one can obtain a graph with no vertices by applying operations $(i),($ ii) and (iii). We proceed by induction on $n$; the base case $n=0$ is trivial.\n\nFor the induction step, let us show how to apply several operations so as to obtain a graph containing no vertices of the form $A_{n}^{j}$ for $j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. We will do this in three steps.\n\nStep 1. We apply repeatedly operation $(i)$ to any appropriate vertices while it is possible. In the resulting graph, all vertices have even degrees.\n\nStep 2. Apply operation (ii) obtaining a subgraph of $G_{n}^{m+1}$ with all degrees being odd. In this graph, we delete one by one all the vertices $A_{n}^{j}$ where the sum of the binary digits of $j$ is even; it is possible since there are no edges between such vertices, so all their degrees remain odd. After that, we delete all isolated vertices.\n\nStep 3. Finally, consider any remaining vertex $A_{n}^{j}$ (then the sum of digits of $j$ is odd). If its degree is odd, then we simply delete it. Otherwise, since $A_{n}^{j}$ is not isolated, we consider any vertex adjacent to it. It has the form $A_{k}^{j}$ for some $k<n$ (otherwise it would have the form $A_{n}^{\\ell}$, where $\\ell$ has an even digit sum; but any such vertex has already been deleted at Step 2). No neighbor of $A_{k}^{j}$ was deleted at Steps 2 and 3, so it has an odd degree. Then we successively delete $A_{k}^{j}$ and $A_{n}^{j}$.\n\nNotice that this deletion does not affect the applicability of this step to other vertices, since no two vertices $A_{i}^{j}$ and $A_{k}^{\\ell}$ for different $j, \\ell$ with odd digit sum are connected with an edge. Thus we will delete all the remaining vertices of the form $A_{n}^{j}$, obtaining a subgraph of $G_{n-1}^{m+1}$. The application of the induction hypothesis finishes the proof.']"

Moreover, there are at most $r$ distinct numbers among the terms of $\\left(b_{i}\\right)$.\n\nProof. To prove the first claim, let us notice that there exists an infinite sequence of indices $k_{1}=k, k_{2}, k_{3}, \\ldots$ such that $b_{k_{1}}=b_{k_{2}}=\\cdots=b_{k}$ and $k_{i}<k_{i+1} \\leqslant k_{i}+r$ for all $i \\geqslant 1$. This sequence is unbounded from above, thus it hits each segment of the form $[\\ell, \\ell+r-1]$ with $\\ell \\geqslant k$, as required.\n\nTo prove the second claim, assume, to the contrary, that there exist $r+1$ distinct numbers $b_{i_{1}}, \\ldots, b_{i_{r+1}}$. Let us apply the first claim to $k=i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{r+1}$ and $\\ell=\\max \\left\\{i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{r+1}\\right\\}$; we obtain that for every $j \\in\\{1, \\ldots, r+1\\}$ there exists $t_{j} \\in[s, s+r-1]$ such that $b_{t_{j}}=b_{i_{j}}$. Thus the segment $[s, s+r-1]$ should contain $r+1$ distinct integers, which is absurd.\n\nSetting $s=0$ in the problem condition, we see that the sequence $\\left(a_{i}\\right)$ satisfies the condition of the lemma, thus it attains at most $r$ distinct values. Denote by $A_{i}$ the ordered $r$-tuple $\\left(a_{i}, \\ldots, a_{i+r-1}\\right)$; then among $A_{i}$ 's there are at most $r^{r}$ distinct tuples, so for every $k \\geqslant 0$ two of the tuples $A_{k}, A_{k+1}, \\ldots, A_{k+r^{r}}$ are identical. This means that there exists a positive integer $p \\leqslant r^{r}$ such that the equality $A_{d}=A_{d+p}$ holds infinitely many times. Let $D$ be the set of indices $d$ satisfying this relation.\n\nNow we claim that $D$ coincides with the set of all nonnegative integers. Since $D$ is unbounded, it suffices to show that $d \\in D$ whenever $d+1 \\in D$. For that, denote $b_{k}=S(k, p+k)$. The sequence $b_{0}, b_{1}, \\ldots$ satisfies the lemma conditions, so there exists an index $t \\in[d+1, d+r]$ such that $S(t, t+p)=S(d, d+p)$. This last relation rewrites as $S(d, t)=S(d+p, t+p)$. Since $A_{d+1}=A_{d+p+1}$, we have $S(d+1, t)=S(d+p+1, t+p)$, therefore we obtain\n\n$$\na_{d}=S(d, t)-S(d+1, t)=S(d+p, t+p)-S(d+p+1, t+p)=a_{d+p}\n$$\n\nand thus $A_{d}=A_{d+p}$, as required.\n\nFinally, we get $A_{d}=A_{d+p}$ for all $d$, so in particular $a_{d}=a_{d+p}$ for all $d$, QED.""]"

Indeed, no $b_{y}$ may coincide with any $c_{z}$ since their distances from $x$ are different.

For instance, in Figure 1, $A, B$, and $C$ are aligned, while $B, C$, and $D$ are not.\n\n<img_4048>\n\nFigure 1\n\n<img_3890>\n\nFigure 2\n\nClaim. In a beautiful arrangement, the $k$-chords are aligned for any integer $k$.\n\nProof. We proceed by induction. For $n \\leqslant 3$ the statement is trivial. Now let $n \\geqslant 4$, and proceed by contradiction. Consider a beautiful arrangement $S$ where the three $k$-chords $A, B, C$ are not aligned. If $n$ is not among the endpoints of $A, B$, and $C$, then by deleting $n$ from $S$ we obtain a beautiful arrangement $S \\backslash\\{n\\}$ of $[0, n-1]$, where $A, B$, and $C$ are aligned by the induction hypothesis. Similarly, if 0 is not among these endpoints, then deleting 0 and decreasing all the numbers by 1 gives a beautiful arrangement $S \\backslash\\{0\\}$ where $A, B$, and $C$ are aligned. Therefore both 0 and $n$ are among the endpoints of these segments. If $x$ and $y$ are their respective partners, we have $n \\geqslant 0+x=k=n+y \\geqslant n$. Thus 0 and $n$ are the endpoints of one of the chords; say it is $C$.\n\nLet $D$ be the chord formed by the numbers $u$ and $v$ which are adjacent to 0 and $n$ and on the same side of $C$ as $A$ and $B$, as shown in Figure 2. Set $t=u+v$. If we had $t=n$, the $n-$ chords $A$, $B$, and $D$ would not be aligned in the beautiful arrangement $S \\backslash\\{0, n\\}$, contradicting the induction hypothesis. If $t<n$, then the $t$-chord from 0 to $t$ cannot intersect $D$, so the chord $C$ separates $t$ and $D$. The chord $E$ from $t$ to $n-t$ does not intersect $C$, so $t$ and $n-t$ are on the same side of $C$. But then the chords $A, B$, and $E$ are not aligned in $S \\backslash\\{0, n\\}$, a contradiction. Finally, the case $t>n$ is equivalent to the case $t<n$ via the beauty-preserving relabelling $x \\mapsto n-x$ for $0 \\leqslant x \\leqslant n$, which sends $t$-chords to $(2 n-t)$-chords. This proves the Claim.\n\nHaving established the Claim, we prove the desired result by induction. The case $n=2$ is trivial. Now assume that $n \\geqslant 3$. Let $S$ be a beautiful arrangement of $[0, n]$ and delete $n$ to obtain\n\n\n\nthe beautiful arrangement $T$ of $[0, n-1]$. The $n$-chords of $T$ are aligned, and they contain every point except 0 . Say $T$ is of Type 1 if 0 lies between two of these $n$-chords, and it is of Type 2 otherwise; i.e., if 0 is aligned with these $n$-chords. We will show that each Type 1 arrangement of $[0, n-1]$ arises from a unique arrangement of $[0, n]$, and each Type 2 arrangement of $[0, n-1]$ arises from exactly two beautiful arrangements of $[0, n]$.\n\nIf $T$ is of Type 1, let 0 lie between chords $A$ and $B$. Since the chord from 0 to $n$ must be aligned with $A$ and $B$ in $S, n$ must be on the other arc between $A$ and $B$. Therefore $S$ can be recovered uniquely from $T$. In the other direction, if $T$ is of Type 1 and we insert $n$ as above, then we claim the resulting arrangement $S$ is beautiful. For $0<k<n$, the $k$-chords of $S$ are also $k$-chords of $T$, so they are aligned. Finally, for $n<k<2 n$, notice that the $n$-chords of $S$ are parallel by construction, so there is an antisymmetry axis $\\ell$ such that $x$ is symmetric to $n-x$ with respect to $\\ell$ for all $x$. If we had two $k$-chords which intersect, then their reflections across $\\ell$ would be two $(2 n-k)$-chords which intersect, where $0<2 n-k<n$, a contradiction.\n\nIf $T$ is of Type 2, there are two possible positions for $n$ in $S$, on either side of 0 . As above, we check that both positions lead to beautiful arrangements of $[0, n]$.\n\nHence if we let $M_{n}$ be the number of beautiful arrangements of $[0, n]$, and let $L_{n}$ be the number of beautiful arrangements of $[0, n-1]$ of Type 2 , we have\n\n$$\nM_{n}=\\left(M_{n-1}-L_{n-1}\\right)+2 L_{n-1}=M_{n-1}+L_{n-1} \\text {. }\n$$\n\nIt then remains to show that $L_{n-1}$ is the number of pairs $(x, y)$ of positive integers with $x+y=n$ and $\\operatorname{gcd}(x, y)=1$. Since $n \\geqslant 3$, this number equals $\\varphi(n)=\\#\\{x: 1 \\leqslant x \\leqslant n, \\operatorname{gcd}(x, n)=1\\}$.\n\nTo prove this, consider a Type 2 beautiful arrangement of $[0, n-1]$. Label the positions $0, \\ldots, n-1(\\bmod n)$ clockwise around the circle, so that number 0 is in position 0 . Let $f(i)$ be the number in position $i$; note that $f$ is a permutation of $[0, n-1]$. Let $a$ be the position such that $f(a)=n-1$.\n\nSince the $n$-chords are aligned with 0 , and every point is in an $n$-chord, these chords are all parallel and\n\n$$\nf(i)+f(-i)=n \\quad \\text { for all } i\n$$\n\nSimilarly, since the $(n-1)$-chords are aligned and every point is in an $(n-1)$-chord, these chords are also parallel and\n\n$$\nf(i)+f(a-i)=n-1 \\quad \\text { for all } i \\text {. }\n$$\n\nTherefore $f(a-i)=f(-i)-1$ for all $i$; and since $f(0)=0$, we get\n\n$$\nf(-a k)=k \\quad \\text { for all } k \\text {. }\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nRecall that this is an equality modulo $n$. Since $f$ is a permutation, we must have $(a, n)=1$. Hence $L_{n-1} \\leqslant \\varphi(n)$.\n\nTo prove equality, it remains to observe that the labeling (1) is beautiful. To see this, consider four numbers $w, x, y, z$ on the circle with $w+y=x+z$. Their positions around the circle satisfy $(-a w)+(-a y)=(-a x)+(-a z)$, which means that the chord from $w$ to $y$ and the chord from $x$ to $z$ are parallel. Thus (1) is beautiful, and by construction it has Type 2. The desired result follows.'
 'Notice that there are exactly $N$ irreducible fractions $f_{1}<\\cdots<f_{N}$ in $(0,1)$ whose denominator is at most $n$, since the pair $(x, y)$ with $x+y \\leqslant n$ and $(x, y)=1$ corresponds to the fraction $x /(x+y)$. Write $f_{i}=\\frac{a_{i}}{b_{i}}$ for $1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant N$.\n\nWe begin by constructing $N+1$ beautiful arrangements. Take any $\\alpha \\in(0,1)$ which is not one of the above $N$ fractions. Consider a circle of perimeter 1 . Successively mark points $0,1,2, \\ldots, n$ where 0 is arbitrary, and the clockwise distance from $i$ to $i+1$ is $\\alpha$. The point $k$ will be at clockwise distance $\\{k \\alpha\\}$ from 0 , where $\\{r\\}$ denotes the fractional part of $r$. Call such a circular arrangement cyclic and denote it by $A(\\alpha)$. If the clockwise order of the points is the same in $A\\left(\\alpha_{1}\\right)$ and $A\\left(\\alpha_{2}\\right)$, we regard them as the same circular arrangement. Figure 3 shows the cyclic arrangement $A(3 / 5+\\epsilon)$ of $[0,13]$ where $\\epsilon>0$ is very small.\n\n<img_3809>\n\nFigure 3\n\nIf $0 \\leqslant a, b, c, d \\leqslant n$ satisfy $a+c=b+d$, then $a \\alpha+c \\alpha=b \\alpha+d \\alpha$, so the chord from $a$ to $c$ is parallel to the chord from $b$ to $d$ in $A(\\alpha)$. Hence in a cyclic arrangement all $k$-chords are parallel. In particular every cyclic arrangement is beautiful.\n\nNext we show that there are exactly $N+1$ distinct cyclic arrangements. To see this, let us see how $A(\\alpha)$ changes as we increase $\\alpha$ from 0 to 1 . The order of points $p$ and $q$ changes precisely when we cross a value $\\alpha=f$ such that $\\{p f\\}=\\{q f\\}$; this can only happen if $f$ is one of the $N$ fractions $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{N}$. Therefore there are at most $N+1$ different cyclic arrangements.\n\nTo show they are all distinct, recall that $f_{i}=a_{i} / b_{i}$ and let $\\epsilon>0$ be a very small number. In the arrangement $A\\left(f_{i}+\\epsilon\\right)$, point $k$ lands at $\\frac{k a_{i}\\left(\\bmod b_{i}\\right)}{b_{i}}+k \\epsilon$. Therefore the points are grouped into $b_{i}$ clusters next to the points $0, \\frac{1}{b_{i}}, \\ldots, \\frac{b_{i}-1}{b_{i}}$ of the circle. The cluster following $\\frac{k}{b_{i}}$ contains the numbers congruent to $k a_{i}^{-1}$ modulo $b_{i}$, listed clockwise in increasing order. It follows that the first number after 0 in $A\\left(f_{i}+\\epsilon\\right)$ is $b_{i}$, and the first number after 0 which is less than $b_{i}$ is $a_{i}^{-1}\\left(\\bmod b_{i}\\right)$, which uniquely determines $a_{i}$. In this way we can recover $f_{i}$ from the cyclic arrangement. Note also that $A\\left(f_{i}+\\epsilon\\right)$ is not the trivial arrangement where we list $0,1, \\ldots, n$ in order clockwise. It follows that the $N+1$ cyclic arrangements $A(\\epsilon), A\\left(f_{1}+\\epsilon\\right), \\ldots, A\\left(f_{N}+\\epsilon\\right)$ are distinct.\n\nLet us record an observation which will be useful later:\n\n$$\n\\text { if } f_{i}<\\alpha<f_{i+1} \\text { then } 0 \\text { is immediately after } b_{i+1} \\text { and before } b_{i} \\text { in } A(\\alpha) \\text {. }\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nIndeed, we already observed that $b_{i}$ is the first number after 0 in $A\\left(f_{i}+\\epsilon\\right)=A(\\alpha)$. Similarly we see that $b_{i+1}$ is the last number before 0 in $A\\left(f_{i+1}-\\epsilon\\right)=A(\\alpha)$.\n\n\n\nFinally, we show that any beautiful arrangement of $[0, n]$ is cyclic by induction on $n$. For $n \\leqslant 2$ the result is clear. Now assume that all beautiful arrangements of $[0, n-1]$ are cyclic, and consider a beautiful arrangement $A$ of $[0, n]$. The subarrangement $A_{n-1}=A \\backslash\\{n\\}$ of $[0, n-1]$ obtained by deleting $n$ is cyclic; say $A_{n-1}=A_{n-1}(\\alpha)$.\n\nLet $\\alpha$ be between the consecutive fractions $\\frac{p_{1}}{q_{1}}<\\frac{p_{2}}{q_{2}}$ among the irreducible fractions of denominator at most $n-1$. There is at most one fraction $\\frac{i}{n}$ in $\\left(\\frac{p_{1}}{q_{1}}, \\frac{p_{2}}{q_{2}}\\right)$, since $\\frac{i}{n}<\\frac{i}{n-1} \\leqslant \\frac{i+1}{n}$ for $0<i \\leqslant n-1$.\n\nCase 1. There is no fraction with denominator $n$ between $\\frac{p_{1}}{q_{1}}$ and $\\frac{p_{2}}{q_{2}}$.\n\nIn this case the only cyclic arrangement extending $A_{n-1}(\\alpha)$ is $A_{n}(\\alpha)$. We know that $A$ and $A_{n}(\\alpha)$ can only differ in the position of $n$. Assume $n$ is immediately after $x$ and before $y$ in $A_{n}(\\alpha)$. Since the neighbors of 0 are $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ by (2), we have $x, y \\geqslant 1$.\n\n<img_3352>\n\nFigure 4\n\nIn $A_{n}(\\alpha)$ the chord from $n-1$ to $x$ is parallel and adjacent to the chord from $n$ to $x-1$, so $n-1$ is between $x-1$ and $x$ in clockwise order, as shown in Figure 4. Similarly, $n-1$ is between $y$ and $y-1$. Therefore $x, y, x-1, n-1$, and $y-1$ occur in this order in $A_{n}(\\alpha)$ and hence in $A$ (possibly with $y=x-1$ or $x=y-1$ ).\n\nNow, $A$ may only differ from $A_{n}(\\alpha)$ in the location of $n$. In $A$, since the chord from $n-1$ to $x$ and the chord from $n$ to $x-1$ do not intersect, $n$ is between $x$ and $n-1$. Similarly, $n$ is between $n-1$ and $y$. Then $n$ must be between $x$ and $y$ and $A=A_{n}(\\alpha)$. Therefore $A$ is cyclic as desired.\n\nCase 2. There is exactly one $i$ with $\\frac{p_{1}}{q_{1}}<\\frac{i}{n}<\\frac{p_{2}}{q_{2}}$.\n\nIn this case there exist two cyclic arrangements $A_{n}\\left(\\alpha_{1}\\right)$ and $A_{n}\\left(\\alpha_{2}\\right)$ of the numbers $0, \\ldots, n$ extending $A_{n-1}(\\alpha)$, where $\\frac{p_{1}}{q_{1}}<\\alpha_{1}<\\frac{i}{n}$ and $\\frac{i}{n}<\\alpha_{2}<\\frac{p_{2}}{q_{2}}$. In $A_{n-1}(\\alpha), 0$ is the only number between $q_{2}$ and $q_{1}$ by (2). For the same reason, $n$ is between $q_{2}$ and 0 in $A_{n}\\left(\\alpha_{1}\\right)$, and between 0 and $q_{1}$ in $A_{n}\\left(\\alpha_{2}\\right)$.\n\nLetting $x=q_{2}$ and $y=q_{1}$, the argument of Case 1 tells us that $n$ must be between $x$ and $y$ in $A$. Therefore $A$ must equal $A_{n}\\left(\\alpha_{1}\\right)$ or $A_{n}\\left(\\alpha_{2}\\right)$, and therefore it is cyclic.\n\nThis concludes the proof that every beautiful arrangement is cyclic. It follows that there are exactly $N+1$ beautiful arrangements of $[0, n]$ as we wished to show.']"
2069,"Players $A$ and $B$ play a paintful game on the real line. Player $A$ has a pot of paint with four units of black ink. A quantity $p$ of this ink suffices to blacken a (closed) real interval of length $p$. In every round, player $A$ picks some positive integer $m$ and provides $1 / 2^{m}$ units of ink from the pot. Player $B$ then picks an integer $k$ and blackens the interval from $k / 2^{m}$ to $(k+1) / 2^{m}$ (some parts of this interval may have been blackened before). The goal of player $A$ is to reach a situation where the pot is empty and the interval $[0,1]$ is not completely blackened.

Let $m$ be the integer picked by player $A$ in this round; we define an integer $y_{r}$ by\n\n$$\n\\frac{y_{r}}{2^{m}} \\leqslant x_{r}<\\frac{y_{r}+1}{2^{m}}\n$$\n\nNote that $I_{0}^{r}=\\left[y_{r} / 2^{m},\\left(y_{r}+1\\right) / 2^{m}\\right]$ is the leftmost interval that may be painted in round $r$ and that still contains some uncolored point.\n\nPlayer $B$ now looks at the next interval $I_{1}^{r}=\\left[\\left(y_{r}+1\\right) / 2^{m},\\left(y_{r}+2\\right) / 2^{m}\\right]$. If $I_{1}^{r}$ still contains an uncolored point, then player $B$ blackens the interval $I_{1}^{r}$; otherwise he blackens the interval $I_{0}^{r}$. We make the convention that, at the beginning of the game, the interval $[1,2]$ is already blackened; thus, if $y_{r}+1=2^{m}$, then $B$ blackens $I_{0}^{r}$.\n\nOur aim is to estimate the amount of ink used after each round. Firstly, we will prove by induction that, if before $r$ th round the segment $[0,1]$ is not completely colored, then, before this move,\n\n(i) the amount of ink used for the segment $\\left[0, x_{r}\\right]$ is at most $3 x_{r}$; and\n\n(ii) for every $m, B$ has blackened at most one interval of length $1 / 2^{m}$ to the right of $x_{r}$.\n\nObviously, these conditions are satisfied for $r=0$. Now assume that they were satisfied before the $r$ th move, and consider the situation after this move; let $m$ be the number $A$ has picked at this move.\n\nIf $B$ has blackened the interval $I_{1}^{r}$ at this move, then $x_{r+1}=x_{r}$, and $(i)$ holds by the induction hypothesis. Next, had $B$ blackened before the $r$ th move any interval of length $1 / 2^{m}$ to the right of $x_{r}$, this interval would necessarily coincide with $I_{1}^{r}$. By our strategy, this cannot happen. So, condition (ii) also remains valid.\n\nAssume now that $B$ has blackened the interval $I_{0}^{r}$ at the $r$ th move, but the interval $[0,1]$ still contains uncolored parts (which means that $I_{1}^{r}$ is contained in $[0,1]$ ). Then condition (ii) clearly remains true, and we need to check $(i)$ only. In our case, the intervals $I_{0}^{r}$ and $I_{1}^{r}$ are completely colored after the $r$ th move, so $x_{r+1}$ either reaches the right endpoint of $I_{1}$ or moves even further to the right. So, $x_{r+1}=x_{r}+\\alpha$ for some $\\alpha>1 / 2^{m}$.\n\nNext, any interval blackened by $B$ before the $r$ th move which intersects $\\left(x_{r}, x_{r+1}\\right)$ should be contained in $\\left[x_{r}, x_{r+1}\\right]$; by (ii), all such intervals have different lengths not exceeding $1 / 2^{m}$, so the total amount of ink used for them is less than $2 / 2^{m}$. Thus, the amount of ink used for the segment $\\left[0, x_{r+1}\\right]$ does not exceed the sum of $2 / 2^{m}, 3 x_{r}$ (used for $\\left[0, x_{r}\\right]$ ), and $1 / 2^{m}$ used for the\n\n\n\nsegment $I_{0}^{r}$. In total it gives at most $3\\left(x_{r}+1 / 2^{m}\\right)<3\\left(x_{r}+\\alpha\\right)=3 x_{r+1}$. Thus condition $(i)$ is also verified in this case. The claim is proved.\n\nFinally, we can perform the desired estimation. Consider any situation in the game, say after the $(r-1)$ st move; assume that the segment $[0,1]$ is not completely black. By $(i i)$, in the segment $\\left[x_{r}, 1\\right]$ player $B$ has colored several segments of different lengths; all these lengths are negative powers of 2 not exceeding $1-x_{r}$; thus the total amount of ink used for this interval is at most $2\\left(1-x_{r}\\right)$. Using $(i)$, we obtain that the total amount of ink used is at most $3 x_{r}+2\\left(1-x_{r}\\right)<3$. Thus the pot is not empty, and therefore $A$ never wins.']"

Since $F O_{3}$ and $A O_{1}$ are translations of $M O$, quadrilateral $A F O_{3} O_{1}$ is a parallelogram and $O_{3} O_{1}=F A=C D=N L$. Similarly, $O_{1} O_{2}=L M$ and $O_{2} O_{3}=M N$. Therefore $\\triangle O_{1} O_{2} O_{3} \\cong \\triangle L M N$.

By our hypothesis the centre $Q$ of $\\Gamma$ lies on $\\Omega$.\n\nLemma. One has $A_{0} B_{1}=A_{0} C_{1}$. Moreover, the points $A, A_{0}, B_{1}$, and $C_{1}$ are concyclic. Finally, the points $A$ and $A_{0}$ lie on the same side of $B_{1} C_{1}$. Similar statements hold for $B$ and $C$.\n\nProof. Let us consider the case $A=A_{0}$ first. Then the triangle $A B C$ is isosceles at $A$, which implies $A B_{1}=A C_{1}$ while the remaining assertions of the Lemma are obvious. So let us suppose $A \\neq A_{0}$ from now on.\n\nBy the definition of $A_{0}$, we have $A_{0} B=A_{0} C$. It is also well known and easy to show that $B C_{1}=$ $C B_{1}$. Next, we have $\\angle C_{1} B A_{0}=\\angle A B A_{0}=\\angle A C A_{0}=\\angle B_{1} C A_{0}$. Hence the triangles $A_{0} B C_{1}$ and $A_{0} C B_{1}$ are congruent. This implies $A_{0} C_{1}=A_{0} B_{1}$, establishing the first part of the Lemma. It also follows that $\\angle A_{0} C_{1} A=\\angle A_{0} B_{1} A$, as these are exterior angles at the corresponding vertices $C_{1}$ and $B_{1}$ of the congruent triangles $A_{0} B C_{1}$ and $A_{0} C B_{1}$. For that reason the points $A, A_{0}, B_{1}$, and $C_{1}$ are indeed the vertices of some cyclic quadrilateral two opposite sides of which are $A A_{0}$ and $B_{1} C_{1}$.\n\nNow we turn to the solution. Evidently the points $A_{1}, B_{1}$, and $C_{1}$ lie interior to some semicircle arc of $\\Gamma$, so the triangle $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ is obtuse-angled. Without loss of generality, we will assume that its angle at $B_{1}$ is obtuse. Thus $Q$ and $B_{1}$ lie on different sides of $A_{1} C_{1}$; obviously, the same holds for the points $B$ and $B_{1}$. So, the points $Q$ and $B$ are on the same side of $A_{1} C_{1}$.\n\nNotice that the perpendicular bisector of $A_{1} C_{1}$ intersects $\\Omega$ at two points lying on different sides of $A_{1} C_{1}$. By the first statement from the Lemma, both points $B_{0}$ and $Q$ are among these points of intersection; since they share the same side of $A_{1} C_{1}$, they coincide (see Figure 1).\n\n<img_3398>\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\nNow, by the first part of the Lemma again, the lines $Q A_{0}$ and $Q C_{0}$ are the perpendicular bisectors of $B_{1} C_{1}$ and $A_{1} B_{1}$, respectively.

 'Let $Q$ again denote the centre of the circumcircle of the triangle $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$, that lies on the circumcircle $\\Omega$ of the triangle $A B C$. We first consider the case where $Q$ coincides with one of the vertices of $A B C$, say $Q=B$. Then $B C_{1}=B A_{1}$ and consequently the triangle $A B C$ is isosceles at $B$. Moreover we have $B C_{1}=B_{1} C$ in any triangle, and hence $B B_{1}=B C_{1}=B_{1} C$; similarly, $B B_{1}=B_{1} A$. It follows that $B_{1}$ is the centre of $\\Omega$ and that the triangle $A B C$ has a right angle at $B$.\n\nSo from now on we may suppose $Q \\notin\\{A, B, C\\}$. We start with the following well known fact. Lemma. Let $X Y Z$ and $X^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}$ be two triangles with $X Y=X^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime}$ and $Y Z=Y^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}$.\n\n(i) If $X Z \\neq X^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}$ and $\\angle Y Z X=\\angle Y^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime} X^{\\prime}$, then $\\angle Z X Y+\\angle Z^{\\prime} X^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime}=180^{\\circ}$.\n\n(ii) If $\\angle Y Z X+\\angle X^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime}=180^{\\circ}$, then $\\angle Z X Y=\\angle Y^{\\prime} X^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}$.\n\nProof. For both parts, we may move the triangle $X Y Z$ through the plane until $Y=Y^{\\prime}$ and $Z=Z^{\\prime}$. Possibly after reflecting one of the two triangles about $Y Z$, we may also suppose that $X$ and $X^{\\prime}$ lie on the same side of $Y Z$ if we are in case $(i)$ and on different sides if we are in case (ii). In both cases, the points $X, Z$, and $X^{\\prime}$ are collinear due to the angle condition (see Fig. 2). Moreover we have $X \\neq X^{\\prime}$, because in case $(i)$ we assumed $X Z \\neq X^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}$ and in case $(i i)$ these points even lie on different sides of $Y Z$. Thus the triangle $X X^{\\prime} Y$ is isosceles at $Y$. The claim now follows by considering the equal angles at its base.\n\n<img_3275>\n\nFigure $2(i)$\n\n<img_3630>\n\nFigure $2($ ii $)$\n\nRelabeling the vertices of the triangle $A B C$ if necessary we may suppose that $Q$ lies in the interior of the arc $A B$ of $\\Omega$ not containing $C$. We will sometimes use tacitly that the six triangles $Q B A_{1}, Q A_{1} C, Q C B_{1}, Q B_{1} A, Q C_{1} A$, and $Q B C_{1}$ have the same orientation.\n\nAs $Q$ cannot be the circumcentre of the triangle $A B C$, it is impossible that $Q A=Q B=Q C$ and thus we may also suppose that $Q C \\neq Q B$. Now the above Lemma $(i)$ is applicable to the triangles $Q B_{1} C$ and $Q C_{1} B$, since $Q B_{1}=Q C_{1}$ and $B_{1} C=C_{1} B$, while $\\angle B_{1} C Q=\\angle C_{1} B Q$ holds as both angles appear over the same side of the chord $Q A$ in $\\Omega$ (see Fig. 3). So we get\n\n$$\n\\angle C Q B_{1}+\\angle B Q C_{1}=180^{\\circ}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\n\n\nWe claim that $Q C=Q A$. To see this, let us assume for the sake of a contradiction that $Q C \\neq Q A$. Then arguing similarly as before but now with the triangles $Q A_{1} C$ and $Q C_{1} A$ we get\n\n$$\n\\angle A_{1} Q C+\\angle C_{1} Q A=180^{\\circ} .\n$$\n\nAdding this equation to (1), we get $\\angle A_{1} Q B_{1}+\\angle B Q A=360^{\\circ}$, which is absurd as both summands lie in the interval $\\left(0^{\\circ}, 180^{\\circ}\\right)$.\n\nThis proves $Q C=Q A$; so the triangles $Q A_{1} C$ and $Q C_{1} A$ are congruent their sides being equal, which in turn yields\n\n$$\n\\angle A_{1} Q C=\\angle C_{1} Q A .\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nFinally our Lemma ( $i i$ i) is applicable to the triangles $Q A_{1} B$ and $Q B_{1} A$. Indeed we have $Q A_{1}=Q B_{1}$ and $A_{1} B=B_{1} A$ as usual, and the angle condition $\\angle A_{1} B Q+\\angle Q A B_{1}=180^{\\circ}$ holds as $A$ and $B$ lie on different sides of the chord $Q C$ in $\\Omega$. Consequently we have\n\n$$\n\\angle B Q A_{1}=\\angle B_{1} Q A .\n\\tag{3}\n$$\n\nFrom (1) and (3) we get\n\n$$\n\\left(\\angle B_{1} Q C+\\angle B_{1} Q A\\right)+\\left(\\angle C_{1} Q B-\\angle B Q A_{1}\\right)=180^{\\circ},\n$$\n\ni.e. $\\angle C Q A+\\angle A_{1} Q C_{1}=180^{\\circ}$. In light of (2) this may be rewritten as $2 \\angle C Q A=180^{\\circ}$ and as $Q$ lies on $\\Omega$ this implies that the triangle $A B C$ has a right angle at $B$.\n\n<img_3157>\n\nFigure 3']"

#Elements Identified#:
- Variables: Positive integer \(n\).
- Expressions: \(P(n) = n^{4} + n^{2} + 1\) and \(Q(n) = (n+1)^{4} + (n+1)^{2} + 1\).

- Condition: LPD of \(P(n)\) equals LPD of \(Q(n)\).
- Theme: Prime divisor distribution in specific polynomials and their equality for consecutive arguments.

#Plan#:
- Introduce a large numerical bound to remove infiniteness and enforce computation: set upper limit \(N = 10^{12}\).
- Transform from existence proof to computing a specific numerical output: count the number of \(n\) satisfying the condition within \(n \leq N\).
- Add complexity via range reduction for efficiency: restrict \(n\) to multiples of \(k = 10^4\) to make computation non-trivial but feasible with modular checks.
- Require computation of a derived statistic: calculate the sum of the largest prime divisors for all such \(n\).
- Ensure logical coherence: The count and sum must account for the equality of LPDs in computationally intensive factorization tasks.

#Plan#:
1. **Replace Base**: Change from base 10 to an arbitrary base \(b \geq 3\) (adds constraint and modular arithmetic complexity).
2. **Incorporate Irrational Rotation**: Generate digits from the fractional part of \(n \alpha\), where \(\alpha\) is an irrational number (e.g., the golden ratio, \(\phi = (1 + \sqrt{5})/2\)), ensuring nonzero digits. This introduces real analysis and Diophantine approximation.

**Step 2**  
**#Plan#**:  
1. **Increase dimensionality**: Instead of a single starting number \(n\), introduce a finite multiset of integers \(S = \{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_t\}\), all \(\geq k\), written simultaneously on the blackboard. This forces analysis of multiple independent components, raising combinatorial complexity.  
2. **Modify computational task**: Drop the proof instruction; instead, require computing the winner (Ana or Banana) for a specific large \(k\) and a specified multiset \(S\) with large values (e.g., 100-digit numbers to prevent brute force). This demands leveraging the prime-set equivalence from the proof to reduce state space.  
3. **Add parameters and constraints**: Set \(k = 100\) explicitly and let \(S\) contain 20 numbers, each between \(10^{19}\) and \(10^{20}\), ensuring players must use the prime-factor equivalence to compute the game value efficiently. Add that Banana wins only if the XOR of the individual Grundy numbers is zero, where each Grundy number is derived from the prime subset \(\leq k\). This incorporates combinatorial game theory (nimbers) and forces non-trivial equivalence-based computation.  
4. **Ensure justifiability and coherence**: The equivalence classes based on prime subsets \(\leq k\) (with \(2^{25}\) classes for \(k=100\)) allow the use of precomputed Grundy values via smaller representatives, justifying feasibility without brute force. Interconnections are maintained via the shared move rules and win/loss dependence on the same prime logic. Avoid ambiguity by specifying exact ranges and output format.

So if some $n \\geqslant k$ is bad, then Ana has a winning strategy in the game with starting number $n$.\n\nMore precisely, if $n \\geqslant k$ is such that there is a good integer $m$ with $n>m \\geqslant k$ and $\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=1$, then $n$ itself is bad, for Ana has the following winning strategy in the game with initial number $n$ : She proceeds by first playing $m$ and then using Banana's strategy for the game with starting number $m$.\n\nOtherwise, if some integer $n \\geqslant k$ has the property that every integer $m$ with $n>m \\geqslant k$ and $\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=1$ is bad, then $n$ is good. Indeed, if Ana can make a first move at all in the game with initial number $n$, then she leaves it in a position where the first player has a winning strategy, so that Banana can defeat her.\n\nIn particular, this implies that any two good numbers have a non-trivial common divisor. Also, $k$ itself is good.\n\nFor brevity, we say that $n \\longrightarrow x$ is a move if $n$ and $x$ are two coprime integers with $n>x \\geqslant k$.\n\nClaim 1. If $n$ is good and $n^{\\prime}$ is a multiple of $n$, then $n^{\\prime}$ is also good.\n\nProof. If $n^{\\prime}$ were bad, there would have to be some move $n^{\\prime} \\longrightarrow x$, where $x$ is good. As $n^{\\prime}$ is a multiple of $n$ this implies that the two good numbers $n$ and $x$ are coprime, which is absurd.\n\nClaim 2. If $r$ and $s$ denote two positive integers for which $r s \\geqslant k$ is bad, then $r^{2} s$ is also bad. Proof. Since $r s$ is bad, there is a move $r s \\longrightarrow x$ for some good $x$. Evidently $x$ is coprime to $r^{2} s$ as well, and hence the move $r^{2} s \\longrightarrow x$ shows that $r^{2} s$ is indeed bad.\n\nClaim 3. If $p>k$ is prime and $n \\geqslant k$ is bad, then $n p$ is also bad.\n\nProof. Otherwise we choose a counterexample with $n$ being as small as possible. In particular, $n p$ is good. Since $n$ is bad, there is a move $n \\longrightarrow x$ for some good $x$. Now $n p \\longrightarrow x$ cannot be a valid move, which tells us that $x$ has to be divisible by $p$. So we can write $x=p^{r} y$, where $r$ and $y$ denote some positive integers, the latter of which is not divisible by $p$.\n\nNote that $y=1$ is impossible, for then we would have $x=p^{r}$ and the move $x \\longrightarrow k$ would establish that $x$ is bad. In view of this, there is a least power $y^{\\alpha}$ of $y$ that is at least as large as $k$. Since the numbers $n p$ and $y^{\\alpha}$ are coprime and the former is good, the latter has to be bad. Moreover, the minimality of $\\alpha$ implies $y^{\\alpha}<k y<p y=\\frac{x}{p^{r-1}}<\\frac{n}{p^{r-1}}$. So $p^{r-1} \\cdot y^{\\alpha}<n$ and consequently all the numbers $y^{\\alpha}, p y^{\\alpha}, \\ldots, p^{r} \\cdot y^{\\alpha}=p\\left(p^{r-1} \\cdot y^{\\alpha}\\right)$ are bad due to the minimal choice of $n$. But now by Claim 1 the divisor $x$ of $p^{r} \\cdot y^{\\alpha}$ cannot be good, whereby we have reached a contradiction that proves Claim 3.\n\n\n\nWe now deduce the statement of the problem from these three claims. To this end, we call two integers $a, b \\geqslant k$ similar if they are divisible by the same prime numbers not exceeding $k$. We are to prove that if $a$ and $b$ are similar, then either both of them are good or both are bad. As in this case the product $a b$ is similar to both $a$ and $b$, it suffices to show the following: if $c \\geqslant k$ is similar to some of its multiples $d$, then either both $c$ and $d$ are good or both are bad.\n\nAssuming that this is not true in general, we choose a counterexample $\\left(c_{0}, d_{0}\\right)$ with $d_{0}$ being as small as possible. By Claim 1, $c_{0}$ is bad whilst $d_{0}$ is good. Plainly $d_{0}$ is strictly greater than $c_{0}$ and hence the quotient $\\frac{d_{0}}{c_{0}}$ has some prime factor $p$. Clearly $p$ divides $d_{0}$. If $p \\leqslant k$, then $p$ divides $c_{0}$ as well due to the similarity, and hence $d_{0}$ is actually divisible by $p^{2}$. So $\\frac{d_{0}}{p}$ is good by the contrapositive of Claim 2. Since $c_{0} \\mid \\frac{d_{0}}{p}$, the pair $\\left(c_{0}, \\frac{d_{0}}{p}\\right)$ contradicts the supposed minimality of $d_{0}$. This proves $p>k$, but now we get the same contradiction using Claim 3 instead of Claim 2. Thereby the problem is solved.""
 'We use the same analysis of the game of numbers as in the first five paragraphs of the first solution. Let us call a prime number $p$ small in case $p \\leqslant k$ and big otherwise. We again call two integers similar if their sets of small prime factors coincide.\n\nClaim 4. For each integer $b \\geqslant k$ having some small prime factor, there exists an integer $x$ similar to it with $b \\geqslant x \\geqslant k$ and having no big prime factors.\n\nProof. Unless $b$ has a big prime factor we may simply choose $x=b$. Now let $p$ and $q$ denote a small and a big prime factor of $b$, respectively. Let $a$ be the product of all small prime factors of $b$. Further define $n$ to be the least non-negative integer for which the number $x=p^{n} a$ is at least as large as $k$. It suffices to show that $b>x$. This is clear in case $n=0$, so let us assume $n>0$ from now on. Then we have $x<p k$ due to the minimality of $n, p \\leqslant a$ because $p$ divides $a$ by construction, and $k<q$. Therefore $x<a q$ and, as the right hand side is a product of distinct prime factors of $b$, this implies indeed $x<b$.\n\nLet us now assume that there is a pair $(a, b)$ of similar numbers such that $a$ is bad and $b$ is good. Take such a pair with $\\max (a, b)$ being as small as possible. Since $a$ is bad, there exists a move $a \\longrightarrow r$ for some good $r$. Since the numbers $k$ and $r$ are both good, they have a common prime factor, which necessarily has to be small. Thus Claim 4 is applicable to $r$, which yields an integer $r^{\\prime}$ similar to $r$ containing small prime factors only and satisfying $r \\geqslant r^{\\prime} \\geqslant k$. Since $\\max \\left(r, r^{\\prime}\\right)=r<a \\leqslant \\max (a, b)$ the number $r^{\\prime}$ is also good. Now let $p$ denote a common prime factor of the good numbers $r^{\\prime}$ and $b$. By our construction of $r^{\\prime}$, this prime is small and due to the similarities it consequently divides $a$ and $r$, contrary to $a \\longrightarrow r$ being a move.

**Step 2**  
#Plan#:  
- **Transform proof to computation**: Replace proof with a difficult numerical computation requiring specific output.  
- **Fix $\nu$ and $m$**: Use $\nu = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$ (golden ratio, to leverage periodic continued fraction) and $m = 2024$ (large with multiple factors: $2024=2^3 \times 11 \times 23$, ensuring non-trivial divisor sum, yet computable).  
- **Modify objective**: Instead of counting pairs, compute the minimal product $a \times b$ over excellent pairs (adds optimization layer, and minimizes a combined metric requiring concrete pair identification).  
- **Enhance complexity**: Product minimization depends on $\nu$'s approximation properties (convergents from continued fractions) and divisor structure, ensuring interdependence.  
- **Ensure coherence**: Minimal $a \times b$ derives from excellent pairs' scaling tie to divisors under $\nu$, preserving core theme while demanding non-enumerative solution.

Let $\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $m = 2024$. A pair $(a, b)$ of positive integers is good if $a\lceil b\phi\rceil - b\lfloor a\phi\rfloor = 2024$. It is excellent if neither $(a-b, b)$ nor $(a, b-a)$ is good. Compute the minimal value of $a \times b$ over all excellent pairs.",success,144.64,"['For positive integers $a$ and $b$, let us denote\n\n$$\nf(a, b)=a\\lceil b \\nu\\rceil-b\\lfloor a \\nu\\rfloor\n$$\n\nWe will deal with various values of $m$; thus it is convenient to say that a pair $(a, b)$ is $m$-good or $m$-excellent if the corresponding conditions are satisfied.\n\nTo start, let us investigate how the values $f(a+b, b)$ and $f(a, b+a)$ are related to $f(a, b)$. If $\\{a \\nu\\}+\\{b \\nu\\}<1$, then we have $\\lfloor(a+b) \\nu\\rfloor=\\lfloor a \\nu\\rfloor+\\lfloor b \\nu\\rfloor$ and $\\lceil(a+b) \\nu\\rceil=\\lceil a \\nu\\rceil+\\lceil b \\nu\\rceil-1$, so\n\n$$\nf(a+b, b)=(a+b)\\lceil b \\nu\\rceil-b(\\lfloor a \\nu\\rfloor+\\lfloor b \\nu\\rfloor)=f(a, b)+b(\\lceil b \\nu\\rceil-\\lfloor b \\nu\\rfloor)=f(a, b)+b\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nf(a, b+a)=a(\\lceil b \\nu\\rceil+\\lceil a \\nu\\rceil-1)-(b+a)\\lfloor a \\nu\\rfloor=f(a, b)+a(\\lceil a \\nu\\rceil-1-\\lfloor a \\nu\\rfloor)=f(a, b) .\n$$\n\nSimilarly, if $\\{a \\nu\\}+\\{b \\nu\\} \\geqslant 1$ then one obtains\n\n$$\nf(a+b, b)=f(a, b) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad f(a, b+a)=f(a, b)+a\n$$\n\nSo, in both cases one of the numbers $f(a+b, a)$ and $f(a, b+a)$ is equal to $f(a, b)$ while the other is greater than $f(a, b)$ by one of $a$ and $b$. Thus, exactly one of the pairs $(a+b, b)$ and $(a, b+a)$ is excellent (for an appropriate value of $m$ ).\n\nNow let us say that the pairs $(a+b, b)$ and $(a, b+a)$ are the children of the pair $(a, b)$, while this pair is their parent. Next, if a pair $(c, d)$ can be obtained from $(a, b)$ by several passings from a parent to a child, we will say that $(c, d)$ is a descendant of $(a, b)$, while $(a, b)$ is an ancestor of $(c, d)$ (a pair is neither an ancestor nor a descendant of itself). Thus each pair $(a, b)$ has two children, it has a unique parent if $a \\neq b$, and no parents otherwise. Therefore, each pair of distinct positive integers has a unique ancestor of the form $(a, a)$; our aim is now to find how many $m$-excellent descendants each such pair has.\n\nNotice now that if a pair $(a, b)$ is $m$-excellent then $\\min \\{a, b\\} \\leqslant m$. Indeed, if $a=b$ then $f(a, a)=a=m$, so the statement is valid. Otherwise, the pair $(a, b)$ is a child of some pair $\\left(a^{\\prime}, b^{\\prime}\\right)$. If $b=b^{\\prime}$ and $a=a^{\\prime}+b^{\\prime}$, then we should have $m=f(a, b)=f\\left(a^{\\prime}, b^{\\prime}\\right)+b^{\\prime}$, so $b=b^{\\prime}=m-f\\left(a^{\\prime}, b^{\\prime}\\right)<m$. Similarly, if $a=a^{\\prime}$ and $b=b^{\\prime}+a^{\\prime}$ then $a<m$.\n\nLet us consider the set $S_{m}$ of all pairs $(a, b)$ such that $f(a, b) \\leqslant m$ and $\\min \\{a, b\\} \\leqslant m$. Then all the ancestors of the elements in $S_{m}$ are again in $S_{m}$, and each element in $S_{m}$ either is of the form $(a, a)$ with $a \\leqslant m$, or has a unique ancestor of this form. From the arguments above we see that all $m$-excellent pairs lie in $S_{m}$.\n\nWe claim now that the set $S_{m}$ is finite. Indeed, assume, for instance, that it contains infinitely many pairs $(c, d)$ with $d>2 m$. Such a pair is necessarily a child of $(c, d-c)$, and thus a descendant of some pair $\\left(c, d^{\\prime}\\right)$ with $m<d^{\\prime} \\leqslant 2 m$. Therefore, one of the pairs $(a, b) \\in S_{m}$ with $m<b \\leqslant 2 m$\n\n\n\nhas infinitely many descendants in $S_{m}$, and all these descendants have the form $(a, b+k a)$ with $k$ a positive integer. Since $f(a, b+k a)$ does not decrease as $k$ grows, it becomes constant for $k \\geqslant k_{0}$, where $k_{0}$ is some positive integer. This means that $\\{a \\nu\\}+\\{(b+k a) \\nu\\}<1$ for all $k \\geqslant k_{0}$. But this yields $1>\\{(b+k a) \\nu\\}=\\left\\{\\left(b+k_{0} a\\right) \\nu\\right\\}+\\left(k-k_{0}\\right)\\{a \\nu\\}$ for all $k>k_{0}$, which is absurd.\n\nSimilarly, one can prove that $S_{m}$ contains finitely many pairs $(c, d)$ with $c>2 m$, thus finitely many elements at all.\n\nWe are now prepared for proving the following crucial lemma.\n\nLemma. Consider any pair $(a, b)$ with $f(a, b) \\neq m$. Then the number $g(a, b)$ of its $m$-excellent descendants is equal to the number $h(a, b)$ of ways to represent the number $t=m-f(a, b)$ as $t=k a+\\ell b$ with $k$ and $\\ell$ being some nonnegative integers.\n\nProof. We proceed by induction on the number $N$ of descendants of $(a, b)$ in $S_{m}$. If $N=0$ then clearly $g(a, b)=0$. Assume that $h(a, b)>0$; without loss of generality, we have $a \\leqslant b$. Then, clearly, $m-f(a, b) \\geqslant a$, so $f(a, b+a) \\leqslant f(a, b)+a \\leqslant m$ and $a \\leqslant m$, hence $(a, b+a) \\in S_{m}$ which is impossible. Thus in the base case we have $g(a, b)=h(a, b)=0$, as desired.\n\nNow let $N>0$. Assume that $f(a+b, b)=f(a, b)+b$ and $f(a, b+a)=f(a, b)$ (the other case is similar). If $f(a, b)+b \\neq m$, then by the induction hypothesis we have\n\n$$\ng(a, b)=g(a+b, b)+g(a, b+a)=h(a+b, b)+h(a, b+a)\n$$\n\nNotice that both pairs $(a+b, b)$ and $(a, b+a)$ are descendants of $(a, b)$ and thus each of them has strictly less descendants in $S_{m}$ than $(a, b)$ does.\n\nNext, each one of the $h(a+b, b)$ representations of $m-f(a+b, b)=m-b-f(a, b)$ as the sum $k^{\\prime}(a+b)+\\ell^{\\prime} b$ provides the representation $m-f(a, b)=k a+\\ell b$ with $k=k^{\\prime}<k^{\\prime}+\\ell^{\\prime}+1=\\ell$. Similarly, each one of the $h(a, b+a)$ representations of $m-f(a, b+a)=m-f(a, b)$ as the sum $k^{\\prime} a+\\ell^{\\prime}(b+a)$ provides the representation $m-f(a, b)=k a+\\ell b$ with $k=k^{\\prime}+\\ell^{\\prime} \\geqslant \\ell^{\\prime}=\\ell$. This correspondence is obviously bijective, so\n\n$$\nh(a, b)=h(a+b, b)+h(a, b+a)=g(a, b)\n$$\n\nas required.\n\nFinally, if $f(a, b)+b=m$ then $(a+b, b)$ is $m$-excellent, so $g(a, b)=1+g(a, b+a)=1+h(a, b+a)$ by the induction hypothesis. On the other hand, the number $m-f(a, b)=b$ has a representation $0 \\cdot a+1 \\cdot b$ and sometimes one more representation as $k a+0 \\cdot b$; this last representation exists simultaneously with the representation $m-f(a, b+a)=k a+0 \\cdot(b+a)$, so $h(a, b)=1+h(a, b+a)$ as well. Thus in this case the step is also proved.\n\nNow it is easy to finish the solution. There exists a unique $m$-excellent pair of the form $(a, a)$, and each other $m$-excellent pair $(a, b)$ has a unique ancestor of the form $(x, x)$ with $x<m$. By the lemma, for every $x<m$ the number of its $m$-excellent descendants is $h(x, x)$, which is the number of ways to represent $m-f(x, x)=m-x$ as $k x+\\ell x$ (with nonnegative integer $k$ and $\\ell$ ). This number is 0 if $x \\not m$, and $m / x$ otherwise. So the total number of excellent pairs is\n\n$$\n1+\\sum_{x \\mid m, x<m} \\frac{m}{x}=1+\\sum_{d \\mid m, d>1} d=\\sum_{d \\mid m} d\n$$\n\nas required.']"

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Transform (Proof -> Computation):** Change the goal from proving the inequality to *computing* the *minimum value* of the difference between the right-hand side and the left-hand side under the constraint.
2.  **Introduce Parameterization:** Replace the abstract constraint with a concrete, asymmetric parameterization. Instead of any `a, b, c` satisfying the constraint, define them using *angular parameters* to introduce functional dependencies and asymmetry while implicitly ensuring the constraint holds. For example: `a = sin²(θ)/cos²(π/7)`, `b = sin²(θ+2π/7)/cos²(π/7)`, `c = sin²(θ+4π/7)/cos²(π/7)` where `θ` is a new parameter. (Note: The choice of angles `2π/7` and `4π/7` ensures symmetry and implicit constraint satisfaction). Define `d=a+b`, `e=b+c`, `f=c+a`.
3.  **Complexity:** The expression for the function to minimize, `S(θ) = √2(√d + √e + √f) - [√((a²+b²)/d) + √((b²+c²)/e) + √((c²+a²)/f) + 3]`, becomes computationally intensive due to the non-linear dependence on `θ`. Crucially, `d`, `e`, `f` become complex functions of `θ`.
4.  **Specify Target:** Require computation of the *minimum value* of `S(θ)` over a specific interval for `θ`, excluding points where the constraint holds trivially (`θ=0`, `θ=π/2`).
5.  **Increase Difficulty:** Demand a *specific numerical answer* with high precision (7 decimal places), forcing detailed computation and understanding versus abstract justification. The chosen angular dependencies ensure the minimum is not trivial.
6.  **Guarantee Constraint:** The parameterization automatically satisfies the constraint `1/a + 1/b + 1/c <= 3` for `θ ∈ (0, π/2)`. This eliminates the need for the abstract constraint.

Step 2  
**#Plan#**:  
1. **Parameterize constants**: Replace fixed card count (\(n\)) and block size (\(k\)) with variables dependent on an input \(n\). Set cards \(= n\) and flip size \(k = n \mod 50 + 1\) (ensuring \(1 \leq k \leq 50\)).  
2. **Change output**: Shift from a binary strategy proof to computing a specific numerical value: the *number of distinct winning move sequences* for Player 1.  
3. **Add combinatorial depth**: Require tracking game states as a binary vector (gold=0, black=1), increasing computational complexity via state-space explosion.  
4. **Introduce input constraint**: Set \(n \geq 2\) to avoid trivial cases and ensure \(k\) is non-trivial.  

Step 3  
**#Rewritten Instruction#**:

We will show that for $k=2^{m}$ the smallest total perimeter of a rectangular partition of $B_{k}$ is $m 2^{m+1}$. Then the overall answer to the problem is $2 \\cdot m 2^{m+1}+4 \\cdot 2^{m}=(m+1) 2^{m+2}$.\n\nFirst we inductively construct for $m \\geq 1$ a partition of $B_{2^{m}}$ with total perimeter $m 2^{m+1}$.

Now we show by induction on $k$ that the total perimeter of a rectangular partition of $B_{k}$ is at least $D_{k}$. The case $k=1$ is trivial (see $m=0$ from above). Let the assertion be true for all positive integers less than $k$. We investigate a fixed rectangular partition of $B_{k}$ that attains the minimal total perimeter. Let $R$ be the rectangle that covers the cell $C_{1 k}$ in the lower right corner. Let $(i, j)$ be the upper left corner of $R$. First we show that $i=j$. Assume that $i<j$. Then the line from $(i, j)$ to $(i+1, j)$ or from $(i, j)$ to $(i, j-1)$ must belong to the boundary of some rectangle in the partition. Without loss of generality assume that this is the case for the line from $(i, j)$ to $(i+1, j)$.\n\nCase 1. No line from $(i, l)$ to $(i+1, l)$ where $j<l<k$ belongs to the boundary of some rectangle of the partition.\n\nThen there is some rectangle $R^{\\prime}$ of the partition that has with $R$ the common side from $(i, j)$ to $(i, k)$. If we join these two rectangles to one rectangle we get a partition with smaller total perimeter, a contradiction.\n\nCase 2. There is some $l$ such that $j<l<k$ and the line from $(i, l)$ to $(i+1, l)$ belongs to the boundary of some rectangle of the partition.\n\nThen we replace the upper side of $R$ by the line $(i+1, j)$ to $(i+1, k)$ and for the rectangles whose lower side belongs to the line from $(i, j)$ to $(i, k)$ we shift the lower side upwards so that the new lower side belongs to the line from $(i+1, j)$ to $(i+1, k)$. In such a way we obtain a rectangular partition of $B_{k}$ with smaller total perimeter, a contradiction.\n\nNow the fact that the upper left corner of $R$ has the coordinates $(i, i)$ is established. Consequently, the partition consists of $R$, of rectangles of a partition of a board congruent to $B_{i}$ and of rectangles of a partition of a board congruent to $B_{k-i}$.

Assume the contrary and let without loss of generality $i<j$. The cell $C_{i j}$ must be covered by some rectangle $R$. The subset $S$ is of type $i$, hence $R$ is contained in $S$. $S$ is of type $j$, thus $R$ does not belong to $S$, a contradiction.

- Bucket capacity: Identical and fixed at 2 liters each.
- Geometry: Regular pentagon, defining neighboring buckets as adjacent vertices.
- Participants: Cinderella and Stepmother with adversarial goals.
- Actions per round: Stepmother distributes exactly 1 liter arbitrarily; Cinderella empties a pair of neighboring buckets.
- Goal: Stepmother aims to overflow any bucket ( >2 liters); Cinderella prevents overflow.
- Sequence: Rounds start with Stepmother's distribution; overflow checked immediately after.
- Core: Proof question on whether Stepmother can force overflow, leveraging combinatorial reasoning.

Step 2
#Plan#:
- Increase bucket count to 11 (a prime larger than 5) on a cycle to amplify strategic complexity.
- Vary capacities: Assign asymmetric capacities, e.g., bucket i has capacity 1.5 + 0.1*i liters for i=1 to 11, ranging from 1.6 to 2.6 liters.
- Introduce evaporation: After Cinderella's action, each bucket loses 0.05 liters (non-negative) to add decay dynamics that interact with strategies.
- Modify distribution: Stepmother adds a fixed amount of 1.2 liters per round to increase overflow pressure.
- Transform to computational question: Ask for the minimum number of rounds Stepmother needs to force overflow under optimal play, requiring precise numerical computation.
- Justification: Changes deepen difficulty by adding arithmetic constraints, capacity heterogeneity, and evaporation, demanding adversarial control and threshold calculations.

Let \(M\) be the set of all positive multiples of \(1005\) that are less than \(1005 \cdot 2009\). Determine the number of distinct arrangements of the jumps such that the grasshopper never lands on any point in \(M\).","**Step 1**  
**#Elements Identified#**:  
- Starting point: 0.  
- Total jumps: 2009, with distinct lengths \(1, 2, \dots, 2009\) to the right.  
- Set \(M\): 2008 positive integers, each less than \(1005 \times 2009\).  
- Goal: Prove it is possible to arrange jumps to avoid landing on any point in \(M\).  
- Constraints: Avoidance required at all intermediate landing points after each jump.  

**Step 2**  
**#Plan#**:  
1. **Specific structured set M**: Replace the arbitrary set \(M\) with a fixed set defined by a rigorous arithmetic progression (multiples of 1005 less than \(1005 \times 2009\)), ensuring exactly 2008 elements.  
2. **Computational objective**: Instead of existence proof, require counting the exact number of valid jump arrangements that avoid \(M\).  
3. **Enhanced complexity**: The set \(M\) now forms an arithmetic progression modulo 1005, interacting with the jump sequence properties such as partial sums modulo 1005 and the presence of two jumps (\(1005\) and \(2010\)) divisible by 1005. This demands advanced number-theoretic and combinatorial techniques for counting under modular constraints.  
4. **Consistency**: Preserve key parameters (2009 jumps, \(1005 \times 2009\) bound) and avoidance theme while shifting focus to a hard computational problem.  

**Step 3**  
**#Rewritten Instruction#**:  
A grasshopper starts at 0 and makes 2009 jumps to the right with distinct lengths \(1, 2, \dots, 2009\) in some order. Let \(M\) be the set of all positive multiples of \(1005\) that are less than \(1005 \cdot 2009\). Determine the number of distinct arrangements of the jumps such that the grasshopper never lands on any point in \(M\).  

**Step 4**  
**#Finally Rewritten Instruction#**:  
A grasshopper starts at 0 and makes 2009 jumps to the right with distinct lengths \(1, 2, \dots, 2009\) in some order. Let \(M\) be the set of all positive multiples of \(1005\) that are less than \(1005 \cdot 2009\). Determine the number of distinct arrangements of the jumps such that the grasshopper never lands on any point in \(M\).",success,395.36,"['We construct the set of landing points of the grasshopper.\n\nCase 1. $M$ does not contain numbers divisible by 2009.\n\nWe fix the numbers $2009 k$ as landing points, $k=1,2, \\ldots, 1005$. Consider the open intervals $I_{k}=(2009(k-1), 2009 k), k=1,2, \\ldots, 1005$. We show that we can choose exactly one point outside of $M$ as a landing point in 1004 of these intervals such that all lengths from 1 to 2009 are realized. Since there remains one interval without a chosen point, the length 2009 indeed will appear. Each interval has length 2009, hence a new landing point in an interval yields with a length $d$ also the length $2009-d$. Thus it is enough to implement only the lengths from $D=\\{1,2, \\ldots, 1004\\}$. We will do this in a greedy way. Let $n_{k}, k=1,2, \\ldots, 1005$, be the number of elements of $M$ that belong to the interval $I_{k}$. We order these numbers in a decreasing way, so let $p_{1}, p_{2}, \\ldots, p_{1005}$ be a permutation of $\\{1,2, \\ldots, 1005\\}$ such that $n_{p_{1}} \\geq n_{p_{2}} \\geq \\cdots \\geq n_{p_{1005}}$. In $I_{p_{1}}$ we do not choose a landing point. Assume that landing points have already been chosen in the intervals $I_{p_{2}}, \\ldots, I_{p_{m}}$ and the lengths $d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{m}$ from $D$ are realized, $m=1, \\ldots, 1004$. We show that there is some $d \\in D \\backslash\\left\\{d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{m}\\right\\}$ that can be implemented with a new landing point in $I_{p_{m+1}}$. Assume the contrary. Then the $1004-(m-1)$ other lengths are obstructed by the $n_{p_{m+1}}$ points of $M$ in $I_{p_{m+1}}$. Each length $d$ can be realized by two landing points, namely $2009\\left(p_{m+1}-1\\right)+d$ and $2009 p_{m+1}-d$, hence\n\n$$\nn_{p_{m+1}} \\geq 2(1005-m)\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nMoreover, since $|M|=2008=n_{1}+\\cdots+n_{1005}$,\n\n$$\n2008 \\geq n_{p_{1}}+n_{p_{2}}+\\cdots+n_{p_{m+1}} \\geq(m+1) n_{p_{m+1}}\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nConsequently, by (1) and (2),\n\n$$\n2008 \\geq 2(m+1)(1005-m)\n$$\n\nThe right hand side of the last inequality obviously attains its minimum for $m=1004$ and this minimum value is greater than 2008 , a contradiction.\n\nCase 2. $M$ does contain a number $\\mu$ divisible by 2009.\n\nBy the pigeonhole principle there exists some $r \\in\\{1, \\ldots, 2008\\}$ such that $M$ does not contain numbers with remainder $r$ modulo 2009. We fix the numbers $2009(k-1)+r$ as landing points, $k=1,2, \\ldots, 1005$. Moreover, $1005 \\cdot 2009$ is a landing point. Consider the open intervals\n\n\n\n$I_{k}=(2009(k-1)+r, 2009 k+r), k=1,2, \\ldots, 1004$. Analogously to Case 1 , it is enough to show that we can choose in 1003 of these intervals exactly one landing point outside of $M \\backslash\\{\\mu\\}$ such that each of the lengths of $D=\\{1,2, \\ldots, 1004\\} \\backslash\\{r\\}$ are implemented. Note that $r$ and $2009-r$ are realized by the first and last jump and that choosing $\\mu$ would realize these two differences again. Let $n_{k}, k=1,2, \\ldots, 1004$, be the number of elements of $M \\backslash\\{\\mu\\}$ that belong to the interval $I_{k}$ and $p_{1}, p_{2}, \\ldots, p_{1004}$ be a permutation of $\\{1,2, \\ldots, 1004\\}$ such that $n_{p_{1}} \\geq n_{p_{2}} \\geq \\cdots \\geq n_{p_{1004}}$. With the same reasoning as in Case 1 we can verify that a greedy choice of the landing points in $I_{p_{2}}, I_{p_{3}}, \\ldots, I_{p_{1004}}$ is possible. We only have to replace (1) by\n\n$$\nn_{p_{m+1}} \\geq 2(1004-m)\n$$\n\n( $D$ has one element less) and (2) by\n\n$$\n2007 \\geq n_{p_{1}}+n_{p_{2}}+\\cdots+n_{p_{m+1}} \\geq(m+1) n_{p_{m+1}}\n$$']"
