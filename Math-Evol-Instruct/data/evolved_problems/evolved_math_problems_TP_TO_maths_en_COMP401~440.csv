Let $t = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}$ and $N = 10^{100}$. Find the maximal set $S \subseteq \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}$ satisfying $|x - m y| > t y$ for all distinct $x, y \in S$ and all $m \in \mathbb{N}$. Output its cardinality $|S|$ and compute $\lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{|S|}{N}$.","Step 1  
**#Elements Identified#**:  
- Core Object: An infinite set $S$ of positive integers.  
- Core Constraint: $|x - m y| > t y$ for all distinct pairs $x,y \in S$ and all integers $m \geq 1$.  
- Parameter: A real number $t \in (0, \frac{1}{2})$.  
- Quantifiers: Existential (""there exists $S$"") and universal (""for every pair $x,y$ and every $m$"").  
- Theme: Diophantine approximation/existence of lacunary sets.  

Step 2  
**#Plan#**:  
1. **Remove existential quantifier**: Require explicit construction of a *maximal* such set $S$ within a *large finite interval* $[1, N]$.  
2. **Fix $t$ concretely**: Choose an irrational number within $(0,0.5)$, like $t = \sqrt{2}/4 \approx 0.3535$, to prevent trivialities.  
3. **Introduce combinatorial metric**: Demand computation of the *exact cardinality* $|S_N|$ of the maximal set $S_N \subseteq \{1, \dots, N\}$ satisfying $\forall x \ne y \in S_N$, $\forall m \geq 1$, $|x - m y| > t y$.  
4. **Add asymptotic goal**: Require calculation of the limiting density $\lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{|S_N|}{N}$, leveraging extremality of $S_N$.  
5. **Embed dependencies**: Ensure all elements must satisfy simultaneous constraints for all pairs via the inequality.

 'Let $M, N$ be the midpoints of arcs $B C, B A$ of the circumcircle $A B C$, respectively. Let $Y$ be the second intersection of $A D$ and circle $A B C$.

We produce it as a composition of three other projections. Let $O$ be the intersection of lines $A D^{\\prime} D Y$ and $C I N$. Projecting the points $Y N C M$ on the circle $A B C$ through the (concyclic) point $A$ to the line $C N$ yields the points $O N C I$.

**#Elements Identified#**:  
- Triangle \(ABC\), incenter \(I\), sides \(AB\), \(AC\), \(BC\).  
- Circles defined via \(B\) and \(C\) tangent to line \(AI\) at \(I\).

### Step 2  
**#Plan#**:  
1. **Assign fixed side lengths** to \(ABC\) (e.g., \(AB = 13\), \(AC = 15\), \(BC = 14\)) to force coordinate-based computation.  
2. **Introduce a variable point \(D\)** on \(BC\), replacing the fixed points \(B\) and \(C\) with a movable parameter.  
3. **Redefine circles**: Circle through \(D\) (instead of \(B\) or \(C\)) tangent to \(AI\) at \(I\), intersecting \(AB\) and \(AC\) at \(P\) and \(Q\) respectively.  
4. **Demand optimization**: Require finding the **maximum area** of \(\triangle PDQ\) as \(D\) moves along \(BC\).  
5. **Add dependency**: Ensure tangency condition constraints \(D\)'s position. Complexity increases via coordinate geometry, derivatives for extrema, and incircle properties.

 'Like before, notice that $A Q \\cdot A C=A P \\cdot A B=A I^{2}$. Consider the positive inversion $\\Psi$ with center $A$ and power $A I^{2}$.

- **Conditions**:  
  1. $b_i \geq a_i$ for each $i$.  
  2. Residues of $b_i$ modulo $n$ are pairwise distinct.  
  3. The sum $b_1 + \cdots + b_n$ is bounded by $n \left( \frac{n-1}{2} + \left\lfloor \frac{a_1 + \cdots + a_n}{n} \right\rfloor \right)$.

- **Key structures**: Bounds on values, distinctness criteria, summation bound derived from input sum.  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
- **Transform to computation**: Replace the existential proof with a numerical computation problem requiring the specific minimal sum of $b_i$, not just existence. This shifts focus to optimization.  
- **Specify complex inputs**: Set $n=100$ and define $a_i$ as $a_i = i^3 - 5i + 2$ for $i = 1$ to $n$, which introduces polynomial evaluation and non-linear growth, complicating residue minimization.  
- **Increase constraints**: Retain conditions 1 and 2, but replace condition 3 by demanding the minimal achievable sum under a lexicographical ordering of the $b_i$ to force a unique solution, adding depth to the residue assignment problem.  
- **Ensure coherence**: The bounded/ lexicographical constraint integrates well with residue distinctness and $a_i$ dependencies, ensuring the problem remains solvable yet computationally intensive. The floor function is implicitly used in $a_i$ computations but directly appears if sum bounds are evaluated for verification.

- Marked points: includes endpoints and intersections.  
- Segments: between consecutive marked points on each chord, labeled with yellow (sum of endpoint labels) and blue (absolute difference of endpoint labels).

#Plan#:  
1. Retain the number of chords as 2019 to ensure a specific computation but introduce a parameter (k) for the modulus in the blue label constraint to increase complexity.  
2. Modify the blue label condition: instead of ""multiple of 3"", generalize to ""multiple of k"" for a given k (with k=3 as a base, but make k variable), and compute for k=5 to add difficulty and require modular arithmetic with different bases.  
3. Transform the proof conclusion into a computation: find the minimum possible number of blue labels that are multiples of k (for k=5), over all valid label assignments (endpoints: 2019 zeros and 2019 ones, intersections: arbitrary integers), and all configurations (chord arrangements), subject to the yellow labels covering 0 to N exactly once.  
4. Add computational complexity by requiring the constant c such that for general position chords (fixing I = \binom{2019}{2}, S = 2019^2), the minimum number is c and must be output; c depends on k=5.

By applying the lemma, we see that $E_{01}+E_{02} \\equiv C_{0} \\bmod 2$.\n\n$$\n\\text { Similarly } E_{01}+E_{12} \\equiv C_{1}, \\quad \\text { and } E_{02}+E_{12} \\equiv C_{2}, \\quad \\bmod 2 \\text {. }\n$$\n\nUsing the fact that $C_{0}=C_{1}=2019$ and $C_{2}=0$, we deduce that either $E_{02}$ and $E_{12}$ are even and $E_{01}$ is odd; or $E_{02}$ and $E_{12}$ are odd and $E_{01}$ is even.\n\nBut if the edge labels are the first $N$ non-negative integers, then $E_{01}=E_{12}$ unless $N \\equiv 0$ modulo 3 , in which case $E_{01}=E_{02}$. So however Alina chooses the vertex labels, it is not possible that the multiset of edge labels is $\\{0, \\ldots, N\\}$.\n\nHence in fact two vertex labels must differ by a multiple of 3 .'
 'As before, colour vertices based on their label modulo 3.\n\nSuppose this gives a valid 3-colouring of the graph with 2019 0s and 2019 1s on the circumference. Identify pairs of 0-labelled vertices and pairs of 1-labelled vertices on the circumference, with one 0 and one 1 left over. The resulting graph has even degrees except these two leaves. So the connected component $\\mathcal{C}$ containing these leaves has an Eulerian path, and any other component has an Eulerian cycle.\n\nLet $E_{01}^{*}$ denote the number of edges between 0 -vertices and 1-vertices in $\\mathcal{C}$, and let $E_{01}^{\\prime}$ denote the number of such edges in the other components, and so on. By studying whether a given vertex has label congruent to 0 modulo 3 or not as we go along the Eulerian path in $\\mathcal{C}$, we find $E_{01}^{*}+E_{02}^{*}$ is odd, and similarly $E_{01}^{*}+E_{12}^{*}$ is odd. Since neither start nor end vertex is a 2 -vertex, $E_{02}^{*}+E_{12}^{*}$ must be even.\n\nApplying the same argument for the Eulerian cycle in each other component and adding up, we find that $E_{01}^{\\prime}+E_{02}^{\\prime}, E_{01}^{\\prime}+E_{12}^{\\prime}, E_{02}^{\\prime}+E_{12}^{\\prime}$ are all even. So, again we find $E_{01}+E_{02}$, $E_{01}+E_{12}$ are odd, and $E_{02}+E_{12}$ is even, and we finish as in the original solution.']"

- **Convert proof to computation**: Shift from proving equivalence to calculating a specific, non-trivial numerical value (circumradius) that requires multi-step vector, angle, and coordinate calculations, incorporating the concyclic condition as given to streamline into a computational task.
- **Incorporate additional constraints**: Use the inherent equivalence (iff) to assert that the circumradius for both circles (through \(O,X,Y,Z,W\) and through \(P,X,Y,Z,W\)) must be identical when the concyclic condition holds, thus demanding computation of the common circumradius for points \(X,Y,Z,W\).
- **Add real-world depth**: Introduce decimal precision requirements (two decimal places) for the answer, increasing algebraic and trigonometric complexity through calculations like vector angles, bisector intersections, line equations, and circle fitting.

- Action: prove existence  
- Theme: combinatorial existence of a set with bounded pairwise LCM  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
1. Change the action from proving existence to a computational task: Require finding the minimum possible value of the sum of all elements in $S$ instead of proving existence, introducing optimization.  
2. Modify the condition to add a real-world constraint: Enforce that all elements of $S$ must be at most $50n$ to increase the difficulty by bounding the search space and requiring efficient construction.  
3. Replace the fixed LCM bound constant $32$ with a variable $c$ that depends on $n$: Set $c = 32$, but demand that $c$ is minimized while keeping the size $6n$, thus adding a minimax element and numerical computation.  
4. Ensure logical interconnection: The sum minimization depends on the element bounds and the pairwise LCM constraint, which now includes minimizing $c$, creating intertwined dependencies.  
5. Increase complexity: By combining element minimization, bounded size, and constant optimization, the problem becomes a hard computational challenge requiring trade-offs in number theory.

*   **Implicit Concepts:** Relationship between set size (`6n`), individual element magnitudes, prime factorization, and the maximum achievable LCM for pairs within a set constrained by its size. The theme is combinatorial number theory concerning the lower bound of the maximum pairwise LCM in a set of fixed size.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Modify Set Size:** Replace the fixed size `6n` with a variable size `k(n)` defined as `6n + floor(√log₂(n))` for `n ≥ 2`. This intimately ties the size to `n` but adds non-linear complexity requiring computation.
2.  **Transform into an Optimization Problem:** Instead of proving existence for a size-dependent lower bound, demand the computation of the *minimal possible* `M` such that *any* set of size `k(n)` must have a pair with LCM > `M`. Specifically, define `L(n)` as the minimum value of `max_{a,b ∈ S} LCM(a, b)` taken over all sets `S` of `k(n)` distinct positive integers. Ask for a specific computation of `L(n)`.
3.  **Introduce Prime Constraint:** Add the requirement that all elements in the set `S` must contain at most the first `p(n)=ceil(1.5n)` prime factors (counting multiplicity) in their prime factorization. This necessitates managing the combinatorial explosion within the most constrained prime ""buckets"", exponentially complicating the minimal maximum LCM calculation. This constraint concretizes the core LCM argument and greatly amplifies the difficulty.
4.  **Demand Specific Computation:** Require the computation of `L(100)` to ensure a complex, non-trivial calculation involving large numbers and intricate dependencies. This leverages the variability of `k(n)`, the prime constraint `p(n)`, and the optimization target `L(n)` at scale.

- Initial condition: All in mine on day 1  
- Objective: Prove existence of a day where all collect berries  
- Structure: Prove existence via combinatorial reasoning

**#Plan#**:  
1. **Generalize days**: Increase day count from fixed 16 to a variable \(n\) and require finding the *minimal* \(n\) guaranteeing a day where all collect berries.  
2. **Strengthen constraint**: Replace ""at least three dwarves switched tasks"" with an exact required switch count between pairs of days to complicate scheduling.  
3. **Demand computation**: Ask for the minimal \(n\), enforcing precise combinatorial optimization instead of existential proof.  
4. **Add quantization**: Forbid trivial cases by ensuring initial condition (all in mine) and output the minimal \(n\) as the final answer.

Every such vector encodes the work schedule of a single day: if the $i$-th entry is 0 then the $i$-th dwarf works in the mine, and if this entry is 1 then the $i$-th dwarf collects berries. The 16 working days correspond to 16 vectors $d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{16}$ in $V$, which we will call dayvectors. The condition imposed on any pair of distinct days means that any two distinct day-vectors $d_{i}$ and $d_{j}$ differ in at least three positions.\n\nWe say that a vector $x \\in V$ covers some vector $y \\in V$, if $x$ and $y$ differ in at most one position; note that every vector in $V$ covers exactly eight vectors. For each of the 16 day-vectors $d_{i}$ we define $B_{i} \\subset V$ as the set of the eight vectors that are covered by $d_{i}$. As, for $i \\neq j$, the day-vectors $d_{i}$ and $d_{j}$ differ in at least three positions, their corresponding sets $B_{i}$ and $B_{j}$ are disjoint.

 'If a dwarf $X$ performs the same type of work on three days $D_{1}, D_{2}, D_{3}$, then we say that this triple of days is monotonous for $X$.

Then among the remaining dwarves there exist three dwarves $Y_{1}, Y_{2}, Y_{3}$ that performed both types of work on day $D_{1}$ and on day $D_{2}$; without loss of generality these three dwarves worked in the mine on day $D_{1}$ and collected berries on day $D_{2}$. On day $D_{3}$, two of $Y_{1}, Y_{2}, Y_{3}$ performed the same type of work, and without loss of generality $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$ worked in the mine. But then on days $D_{1}$ and $D_{3}$, each of the five dwarves $X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}, Y_{1}, Y_{2}$ performed only one type of work; this is in contradiction with the problem statement.)\n\nNext we consider some fixed triple $X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}$ of dwarves. There are eight possible working schedules for $X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}$ (like mine-mine-mine, mine-mine-berries, mine-berriesmine, etc).

In particular this implies that every dwarf worked exactly eight times in the mine and exactly eight times in the forest.\n\nFor $0 \\leqslant k \\leqslant 7$ we denote by $d(k)$ the number of days on which exactly $k$ dwarves were collecting berries. Since on the first day all seven dwarves were in the mine, on each of the remaining days at least three dwarves collected berries. This yields $d(0)=1$ and $d(1)=d(2)=0$.

As there are $7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5=210$ triples of pairwise distinct dwarves, and as every working schedule for three fixed dwarves occurs on exactly two days, we get $q=420$. As every day on which $k$ dwarves collect berries contributes $k(k-1)(k-2)$ such quadruples, we also have\n\n$$\n3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\cdot d(3)+4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot d(4)+5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot d(5)+6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot d(6)=q=420\n$$\n\n\n\nwhich simplifies to\n\n$$\nd(3)+4 d(4)+10 d(5)+20 d(6)=70 \\tag{3}\n$$\n\nFinally, we count the number $r$ of quadruples $\\left(X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}, D\\right)$ for which $X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}$ are three pairwise distinct dwarves that all worked in the mine on day $D$.

Output the maximum of \(S_a\) over all valid sequences.","### Step 1
**#Elements Identified#:**
- **Variables**: Integers \(n > 1\) and \(m > 1\), sequences of positive integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m\) each bounded by \(n^m\), and sequences of positive integers \(b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m\) each bounded by \(n\).
- **Conditions**: \(a_i \leq n^m\), \(b_i \leq n\), and the gcd of the sums \((a_1 + b_1, \ldots, a_m + b_m)\) must be less than \(n\).
- **Actions/Processes**: Proving the existence of \(b_i\) satisfying the condition for any given \(a_i\) sequence.
- **Theme**: Using combinatorial constraints and number theory (pigeonhole principle) to force a small gcd through additive perturbations.

### Step 2
**#Plan#:**
1. **Replace proof with computational goal**: Instead of proving existence, require computing the minimum possible gcd value over choices of \(b_i\), which is harder due to optimization.
2. **Introduce interdependencies and additional parameters**: 
   - Add a prime modulus constraint: Require \(b_i\) to be chosen such that not all \(a_i\) are congruent modulo a prime \( p < n \), increasing difficulty by adding primality testing and modular constraints.
   - Include a multiplicative size factor: Make \( m \) depend on a new variable \( k \), specifically \( m = n + k \), to scale complexity with \( n \) and introduce a new dimension.
3. **Ask for specific computable output**: Output the minimum value of \(\operatorname{gcd}(a_1 + b_1, \ldots, a_m + b_m)\) over the worst-case sequence \(a_1, \ldots, a_m\), requiring maximin optimization, which is computationally intensive.
4. **Increase complexity via real-world constraints**: Add that the choice of \(b_i\) must satisfy a product constraint \(\prod_{i=1}^m b_i \leq n^{m/2}\), adding multiplicative interdependence and bounding.
5. **Ensure coherence**: All additions interconnect logically—\( m = n + k \) and \(k\) vary with \(n\), prime moduli relate to the gcd, and the product constraint tightens the search space for \(b_i\), making computation non-trivial but feasible with number theory.

#Elements Identified#:  
Variables: `m`, `n` (positive integers, m>1), set `{1, 2, ..., 2m}`, `m` pairs.  
Participants: Anastasia (partitions into pairs), Boris (selects one integer per pair, sums them).  
Core Concept: Anastasia forces Boris's sum to *avoid* a specific `n`.  
Theme: Sum-avoidance strategy in partitioning.  
Proof Structure: Strategy existence guaranteed regardless of Boris's choices.  
Constraints: Pairs partition the set; selection and sum are deterministic.  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
1. **Increase dimensionality/reference set:** Change `n` to depend on multiple variables. Set `n = m^2 + k`, where `k` is a new bounded variable (e.g., `k ∈ {1, 2, ..., m}`).  
2. **Expand Anastasia's objective:** Instead of avoiding one `n`, require her to force Boris's sum to be outside an *arithmetic sequence* `S = {m^2 + 1, m^2 + 2, ..., m^2 + m}` for *all* possible selections (i.e., all sums in `S` are impossible).  
3. **Restrict Boris's choices:** Impose asymmetric rules per pair. For each pair `(a_i, b_i)` Anastasia creates, if `a_i + b_i` is prime, Boris *must choose* the larger number; otherwise, he chooses either freely.  
4. **Require concrete computation:** Shift from a proof to computing the number of distinct partition strategies Anastasia can use to achieve her goal (sum ∉ `S`) *for fixed but large `m`*, making the count non-trivial and large.  
5. **Justify complexity:** The primality condition couples pair sums with Boris's forced choices, while counting valid partitions demands combinatorial analysis despite constraints, ensuring computational hardness even for moderate `m`.  

Step 3  
#Rewritten Instruction#:  
Let `m` be a fixed integer with `m ≥ 3`. Anastasia partitions `{1, 2, ..., 2m}` into `m` pairs. For each pair `(a_i, b_i)`, if `a_i + b_i` is prime, Boris must pick the larger number; otherwise, he picks arbitrarily.

Consider \(n \geq 3\) positive real numbers \(a_1\) to \(a_n\) with \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 1\).

Assume for all \(i, j\), \(a_i \leq a_j\) if and only if \(b_i \leq b_j\). Determine the minimum possible value of \(\max_{1 \le i \le n} b_i\).","### Step 1  
**#Elements Identified#**:  
- Variables: \(n \geq 3\), \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) (positive real numbers), \(b_i = \frac{a_{i-1} + a_{i+1}}{a_i}\) with cyclic boundary conditions (\(a_0 = a_n\), \(a_{n+1} = a_1\)).  
- Condition: For all \(i, j\), \(a_i \leq a_j\) if and only if \(b_i \leq b_j\).  
2
- Theme: The equivalence of orderings between \(a_i\) and \(b_i\) implies all \(a_i\) equal.  
- Core components to manipulate:  
  1. Definition of \(b_i\): Replace the simple average with asymmetric weights.  
  2. Mathematical action: Change from proof to computation of a specific, non-trivial value.  
  3. Constraints: Fix a global invariant (e.g., sum or product) and add uneven weights to prevent trivial solutions.  
  4. Participants: Introduce variable weights \(c_i, d_i\) that depend on \(i\).  
  5. Complexity increase: Ask for min/max of a derived quantity, incorporating real-world like variable weights and a fixed sum.  

### Step 2  
**#Plan#**:  
1. Modify \(b_i\)'s definition: Replace \(\frac{a_{i-1} + a_{i+1}}{a_i}\) with \(\frac{c_i a_{i-1} + d_i a_{i+1}}{a_i}\), where \(c_i\) and \(d_i\) are distinct positive weights for each \(i\). This breaks symmetry and adds complexity through parameter variation.  
2. Add realistic constraints: Fix the sum \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 1\) to eliminate scale invariance and force optimization under a resource limit.  
3. Change ""proof"" to ""compute"": Instead of proving equality, compute the minimum possible value of \(\max_{1 \leq i \leq n} b_i\), which is a non-trivial, specific numerical output that requires solving a min-max problem under the ordering condition.  
4. Ensure logical coherence:  
   - The varying weights \(c_i, d_i\) affect \(b_i\) and are key to making the problem asymmetric and harder.  
   - The sum constraint enables a bounded computation, while the min-max target integrates optimization.  
   - The condition \(a_i \leq a_j \iff b_i \leq b_j\) interlinks all variables and must be preserved.  
5. Justify complexity:  
   - The weights \(c_i, d_i\) introduce heterogeneous parameters, forcing case-dependent solutions.  
   - Computing min max \(b_i\) involves extremal reasoning and potential nonlinear solving.  
   - General \(n\) maintains scalability.  

### Step 3  
**#Rewritten Instruction#**:  
Consider \(n \geq 3\) positive real numbers \(a_1\) to \(a_n\) with \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 1\). For each \(i\), define \(b_i = \frac{c_i a_{i-1} + d_i a_{i+1}}{a_i}\), where \(c_i\) and \(d_i\) are given positive weights for \(1 \le i \le n\), and cyclic indices \(a_0 = a_n\), \(a_{n+1} = a_1\). Assume for all \(i, j\), \(a_i \leq a_j\) if and only if \(b_i \leq b_j\). Determine the minimum possible value of \(\max_{1 \le i \le n} b_i\).

**#Finally Rewritten Instruction#**:  
Consider \(n \geq 3\) positive real numbers \(a_1\) to \(a_n\) with \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 1\). For each \(i\), define \(b_i = \frac{c_i a_{i-1} + d_i a_{i+1}}{a_i}\), where \(c_i\) and \(d_i\) are given positive weights for \(1 \le i \le n\), and cyclic indices \(a_0 = a_n\), \(a_{n+1} = a_1\).

Similar as in the above claim, one can prove that if $a_{k} a_{k+2}<a_{k+1}^{2}$ and $a_{k+2}<a_{k+1}$, then $a_{j+1}<a_{j}$ for all $j$, which also cannot be the case. Thus we have that $a_{k} a_{k+2} \\geq a_{k+1}^{2}$ for all indices $k$.\n\nNext observe (e.g. by taking the product over all indices) that this implies $a_{k} a_{k+2}=a_{k+1}^{2}$ for all indices $k$, which is equivalent to $b_{k}=b_{k+1}$ for all $k$ and hence $a_{k+1}=a_{k}$ for all $k$.'
 'Define $c_{i}:=\\frac{a_{i}}{a_{i+1}}$, then $b_{i}=c_{i-1}+1 / c_{i}$. Assume that not all $c_{i}$ are equal to 1.

Let $A F$ meet $\\Sigma$ again at $T$ so $A T$ (containing $O$ ) is a diameter of this circle and by Thales, $T L \\perp A C$.\n\nLet $G$ (on $\\Sigma$ ) be the reflection of $K$ in $A F$. Now $A T$ is the internal angle bisector of $\\angle G A K$ so, by an upmarket use of angles in the same segment (of $\\Sigma$ ), $T L$ is the internal angle bisector of $\\angle G L K$. Thus the line $G L$ is the reflection of the line $K L$ in $T L$, and so also the reflection of $K L$ in the line $A C$ (internal and external angle bisectors).\n\nOur next project is to show that $L G F$ are collinear.

Therefore $\\angle F L K=\\angle G L K$ so $L G F$ is a line.\n\nNow from the second paragraph, $F$ is on the reflection of $K L$ in $A C$. By symmetry, $F$ is also on the reflection of $K L$ in $A B$. Therefore the reflections of $F$ in $A B$ and $A C$ are both on $K L$ which must therefore be the doubled Wallace-Simson line of $F$.

For integer \( m \geq 1 \), let \( s = 2^m \) and \( N = s^s \). Consider the sequence \( d_1 = k \), \( d_{i+1} = \) twist of \( d_i \) in base \( s \) for each integer \( 1 \leq k \leq N \). Compute how many such \( k \) have \( d_i = 1 \) for some \( i \), and output this count modulo \( s^2 - 1 \).",success,21.83,"['First, we consider the difference $k-k^{\\prime \\prime}$. If $k=a s+b$ as in the problem statement, then $k^{\\prime}=b s+a$. We write $a=l s+m$ with $m, l$ non-negative numbers and $m \\leq s-1$. This gives $k^{\\prime \\prime}=m s+(b+l)$ and hence $k-k^{\\prime \\prime}=(a-m) s-l=l\\left(s^{2}-1\\right)$.\n\nWe conclude\n\nFact 1.1. $k \\geq k^{\\prime \\prime}$ for every every $k \\geq 1$\n\nFact 1.2. $s^{2}-1$ divides the difference $k-k^{\\prime \\prime}$.\n\nFact 1.2 implies that the sequences $d_{1}, d_{3}, d_{5}, \\ldots$ and $d_{2}, d_{4}, d_{6}, \\ldots$ are constant modulo $s^{2}-1$. Moreover, Fact 1.1 says that the sequences are (weakly) decreasing and hence eventually constant. In other words, the sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, d_{3}, \\ldots$ is 2 -periodic modulo $s^{2}-1$ (from the start) and is eventually 2-periodic.\n\nNow, assume that some term in the sequence is equal to 1 . The next term is equal to $1^{\\prime}=s$ and since the sequence is 2 -periodic from the start modulo $s^{2}-1$, we conclude that $d_{1}$ is either equal to 1 or $s$ modulo $s^{2}-1$. This proves the first implication.\n\nTo prove the other direction, assume that $d_{1}$ is congruent to 1 or $s$ modulo $s^{2}-1$. We need the observation that once one of the sequences $d_{1}, d_{3}, d_{5}, \\ldots$ or $d_{2}, d_{4}, d_{6}, \\ldots$ stabilises, then their value is less than $s^{2}$. This is implied by the following fact.\n\nFact 1.3. If $k=k^{\\prime \\prime}$, then $k=k^{\\prime \\prime}<s^{2}$.\n\nProof. We use the expression for $k-k^{\\prime \\prime}$ found before. If $k=k^{\\prime \\prime}$, then $l=0$, and so $k^{\\prime \\prime}=m s+b$. Both $m$ and $b$ are reminders after division by $s$, so they are both $\\leq s-1$. This gives $k^{\\prime \\prime} \\leq(s-1) s+(s-1)<s^{2}$.\n\nUsing Fact 1.2, it follows that the sequence $d_{1}, d_{3}, d_{5}, \\ldots$ is constant to 1 or $s$ modulo $s^{2}-1$ and stabilises to 1 or $s$ by Fact 1.3. Since $s^{\\prime}=1$, we conclude that the sequence contains a 1.'
 'We make a number of initial observations. Let $k$ be a positive integer.\n\nFact 2.1. If $k \\geq s^{2}$, then $k^{\\prime}<k$.\n\nProof. Write $k=a s+b$, as in the problem statement. If $k \\geq s^{2}$, then $a \\geq s$ because $b<s$. So, $k^{\\prime}=b s+a \\leq(s-1) s+a \\leq a s \\leq a s+b=k$. Moreover, we cannot have equality since that would imply $s-1=b=0$.\n\nFact 2.2. If $k \\leq s^{2}-1$, then $k^{\\prime} \\leq s^{2}-1$ and $k^{\\prime \\prime}=k$.\n\n\n\nProof. Write $k=a s+b$, as in the problem statement. If $k<s^{2}$, then it must hold $1 \\leq a, b<s$, hence $k^{\\prime}=b s+a<s^{2}$ and $k^{\\prime \\prime}=(b s+a)^{\\prime}=a s+b=k$.\n\nFact 2.3. We have $k^{\\prime} \\equiv s k\\left(\\bmod s^{2}-1\\right)\\left(\\right.$ or equivalently $\\left.k \\equiv s k^{\\prime}\\left(\\bmod s^{2}-1\\right)\\right)$.\n\nProof. We write $k=a s+b$, as in the problem statement. Now,\n\n$$\ns k-k^{\\prime}=s(a s+b)-(b s+a)=a\\left(s^{2}-1\\right) \\equiv 0 \\quad\\left(\\bmod s^{2}-1\\right),\n$$\n\nas desired.\n\nCombining Facts 2.1 and 2.2, we find that the sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, d_{3} \\ldots$ is eventually periodic with period 2, starting at the first value less than $s^{2}$. From Fact 2.3, it follows that\n\n$$\nk^{\\prime \\prime} \\equiv s k^{\\prime} \\equiv s^{2} k \\equiv k \\quad\\left(\\bmod s^{2}-1\\right)\n$$\n\nand hence the sequence is periodic modulo $s^{2}-1$ from the start with period 2 .\n\nNow, if the sequence contains 1 , the sequence eventually alternates between 1 and $s$ since the twist of 1 is $s$ and vice versa. Using periodicity modulo $s^{2}-1$, we must have $n \\equiv 1, s$ $\\left(\\bmod s^{2}-1\\right)$. Conversely, if $n \\equiv 1, s\\left(\\bmod s^{2}-1\\right)$ then the eventual period must contain at least one value congruent to either 1 or $s$ modulo $s^{2}-1$. Since these values must be less than $s^{2}$, this implies that the sequence eventually alternates between 1 and $s$, showing that it contains a 1 .'
 'We give an alternate proof of the direct implication: if the sequence contains a 1 , then the first term is 1 or $s$ modulo $s^{2}-1$. We prove the following fact.\n\nFact 3.1. For all $k \\geq s^{2}$, we have $\\left(k-s^{2}+1\\right)^{\\prime} \\in\\left\\{k^{\\prime}, k^{\\prime}-s^{2}+1\\right\\}$.\n\nProof. We write $k=a s+b$, as in the problem statement. Since $k \\geq s^{2}$, we have $a \\geq s$. If $b<s-1$, then\n\n$$\n\\left(k-s^{2}+1\\right)^{\\prime}=((a-s) s+(b+1))^{\\prime}=(b+1) s+(a-s)=b s+a=k^{\\prime} .\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, if $b=s-1$, then\n\n$$\n\\left(k-s^{2}+1\\right)^{\\prime}=((a-s+1) s+0)^{\\prime}=0 s+(a-s+1)=a-s+1=k^{\\prime}-s^{2}+1 .\n$$\n\nNow assume $n \\geq s^{2}$ and the sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots$ contains a 1 . Denote by $e_{1}, e_{2}, \\ldots$ the sequence constructed as in the problem statement, but with initial value $e_{1}=n-s^{2}+1$. Using the above fact, we deduce that $e_{i} \\equiv d_{i}\\left(\\bmod s^{2}-1\\right)$ and $e_{i} \\leq d_{i}$ for all $i \\geq 1$ by induction on $i$. Hence, the sequence $e_{1}, e_{2}, \\ldots$ also contains a 1 .\n\nSince the conclusion we are trying to reach only depends on the residue of $d_{1}$ modulo $s^{2}-1$, we conclude that without loss of generality we can assume $n<s^{2}$.\n\nFact 2.2. If $k \\leq s^{2}-1$, then $k^{\\prime} \\leq s^{2}-1$ and $k^{\\prime \\prime}=k$.\n\n\nProof. Write $k=a s+b$, as in the problem statement. If $k<s^{2}$, then it must hold $1 \\leq a, b<s$, hence $k^{\\prime}=b s+a<s^{2}$ and $k^{\\prime \\prime}=(b s+a)^{\\prime}=a s+b=k$.\n\nUsing Fact 2.2, it now follows that the sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots$ is periodic with period two. Since 1 and $s$ are twists of each other, it follows that if this sequence contains a 1, it must be alternating between 1 and $s$. Hence, $d_{1} \\equiv 1, s\\left(\\bmod s^{2}-1\\right)$ as desired.\n\nFor the other direction we can make a similar argument, observing that the second of the two cases in the proof of Fact 3.1 can only apply to finitely many terms of the sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, d_{3}, \\ldots$, allowing us to also go the other way.'
 'First assume that $d_{k}=1$ for some $k$. Let $k$ be the smallest such index. If $k=1$ then $n=1$, so we may assume $k \\geqslant 2$.\n\nThen $d_{k-1}=a s+b$ for some non-negative integers $a, b$ satisfying $b<s$ and $b s+a=1$. The only solution is $b=0, a=1$, so $d_{k-1}=s$. So, if $k=2$, then $n=s$, so we may assume $k \\geqslant 3$.\n\nThen there exist non-negative integers $c, d$ satisfying $d_{k-2}=c s+d, d<s$ and $d s+c=s$. We have two solutions: $d=0, c=s$ and $d=1, c=0$. However, in the second case we get $d_{k-2}=1$, which contradicts the minimality of $k$. Hence, $d_{k-2}=s^{2}$. If $k=3$, then $n=d_{1}=s^{2}$, which gives remainder 1 when divided by $s^{2}-1$.\n\nAssume now that $k \\geqslant 4$. We will show that for each $m \\in\\{3,4, \\ldots, k-1\\}$ there exist $b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{m-2} \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, s-1\\}$ such that\n\n$$\nd_{k-m}=s^{m}-\\sum_{i=1}^{m-2} b_{i}\\left(s^{m-i}-s^{m-i-2}\\right) \\tag{9}\n$$\n\nWe will prove this equality by induction on $m$. If $m=3$, then $d_{k-3}=a_{1} s+b_{1}$ for some non-negative integers $a_{1}, b_{1}$ satisfying $b_{1}<s$ and $b_{1} s+a_{1}=d_{k-2}=s^{2}$. Then $a_{1}=s^{2}-b_{1} s$, so $d_{k-3}=s^{3}-b_{1}\\left(s^{2}-1\\right)$, which proves (9) for $m=3$.\n\nAssume that (9) holds for some $m$ and consider $d_{k-(m+1)}$. There exist non-negative integers $a_{m-1}, b_{m-1}$ such that $d_{k-(m+1)}=a_{m-1} s+b_{m-1}, b_{m-1}<s$ and $d_{k-m}=b_{m-1} s+a_{m-1}$. Using the inductive assumption we get\n\n$$\na_{m-1}=d_{k-m}-b_{m-1} s=s^{m}-\\sum_{i=1}^{m-2} b_{i}\\left(s^{m-i}-s^{m-i-2}\\right)-b_{m-1} s\n$$\n\ntherefore\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nd_{k-(m+1)} & =a_{m-1} s+b_{m-1}=s^{m+1}-\\sum_{i=1}^{m-2} b_{i}\\left(s^{m-i}-s^{m-i-2}\\right) s-b_{m-1} s^{2}+b_{m-1} \\\\\n& =s^{m+1}-\\sum_{i=1}^{m-1} b_{i}\\left(s^{m+1-i}-s^{m-i-1}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich completes the proof of (9). In particular, for $m=k-1$ we get\n\n$$\nd_{1}=s^{k-1}-\\sum_{i=1}^{k-3} b_{i}\\left(s^{k-i-1}-s^{k-i-3}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe above sum is clearly divisible by $s^{2}-1$, and it is clear that the remainder of $s^{k-1}$ when divided by $s^{2}-1$ is 1 when $k$ is odd, and $s$ when $k$ is even. It follows that the remainder when $n=d_{1}$ is divided by $s^{2}-1$ is either 1 or $s$.\n\n\n\nTo prove the other implication, assume that $n$ gives remainder 1 or $s$ when divided by $s^{2}-1$. If $n \\in\\left\\{1, s, s^{2}\\right\\}$, then one of the numbers $d_{1}, d_{2}$ and $d_{3}$ is 1 . We therefore assume that $n>s^{2}$. Since the reminder when a power of $s$ is divided by $s^{2}-1$ is either 1 or $s$, there exists a positive integer $m$ such that $s^{m}-n$ is non-negative and divisible by $s^{2}-1$. By our assumption $m \\geqslant 3$. We also take the smallest such $m$, so that $n>s^{m-2}$. The quotient $\\frac{s^{m}-n}{s^{2}-1}$ is therefore smaller than $s^{m-2}$, so there exist $b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{m-2} \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, s-1\\}$ such that $\\frac{s^{m}-n}{s^{2}-1}=\\sum_{i=1}^{m-2} b_{i} s^{i-1}$. It follows that\n\n$$\nn=s^{m}-\\sum_{i=1}^{m-2} b_{i}\\left(s^{i+1}-s^{i-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe now show that\n\n$$\nd_{j}=s^{m+1-j}-\\sum_{i=1}^{m-1-j} b_{i}\\left(s^{i+1}-s^{i-1}\\right) \\tag{10}\n$$\n\nfor $j=1,2, \\ldots, m-2$ by induction on $j$. For $j=1$ this follows from $d_{1}=n$. Assume now that (10) holds for some $j<m-2$. Then\n\n$$\nd_{j}=\\left(s^{m-j}-\\sum_{i=2}^{m-1-j} b_{i}\\left(s^{i}-s^{i-2}\\right)-b_{1} s\\right) s+b_{1}\n$$\n\nAs $d_{j}$ is positive and $b_{1} \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, s-1\\}$, the expression $s^{m-j}-\\sum_{i=2}^{m-1-j} b_{i}\\left(s^{i}-s^{i-2}\\right)-b_{1} s$ has to be non-negative, so we can compute the twist of $d_{j}$ as\n\n$$\nd_{j+1}=b_{1} s+s^{m-j}-\\sum_{i=2}^{m-1-j} b_{i}\\left(s^{i}-s^{i-2}\\right)-b_{1} s=s^{m-j}-\\sum_{i=1}^{m-2-j} b_{i}\\left(s^{i+1}-s^{i-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich finishes the induction.\n\nNow we use (10) for $j=m-2$ and get $d_{m-2}=s^{3}-b_{1}\\left(s^{2}-1\\right)=\\left(s^{2}-b_{1} s\\right)+b_{1}$. Then $d_{m-1}=b_{1} s+s^{2}-b_{1} s=s^{2}=s \\cdot s+0, d_{m}=0 \\cdot s+s=s=1 \\cdot s+0$ and $d_{m+1}=0 \\cdot s+1=1$.']"

#Elements Identified#:
1.  **Triangle (`ABC`) and Circumcircle (`Ω`).**
2.  **Midpoints of Arcs:** `S_b`, `S_c` (midpoints of arcs AC & AB not containing B, C respectively), `N_a` (midpoint of arc BAC).
3.  **Incenter (`I`).**
4.  **Tangent Circles (`ω_b`, `ω_c`):** Defined by tangency to sides (`AB`, `AC`) and internal tangency to `Ω` at (`S_b`, `S_c`).
5.  **Line `I N_a`.**
6.  **Line through intersection points of `ω_b` and `ω_c`.**
7.  **Collinearity on `Ω`:** The goal is to prove these two lines intersect on `Ω`.

**Structure/Theme:** Plane geometry involving circle tangency, arc midpoints, the incenter, circumcircle, and intersections requiring proof of collinearity with the circumcircle.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Make it Computational:** Require calculation of a specific *numerical value* derived from the intersection point.
2.  **Introduce Constraints using Coordinates:** Fix the triangle `ABC` by assigning coordinates (preferrably using complex numbers to represent points in-plane). This allows precise calculation but requires handling non-trivial points derived from the geometric constructs.
3.  **Demand Calculation of Arc Measure:** Instead of showing the intersection lies on `Ω`, ask for the measure (in degrees) of an arc associated with that intersection point and another fixed point. This incorporates trigonometry and circle properties.
4.  **Keep Core Concepts:** Retain the definition of all points (`S_b`, `S_c`, `N_a`, `I`), circles (`Ω`, `ω_b`, `ω_c`), and the critical lines.
5.  **Increase Complexity:** Use a non-special triangle with complex coordinates. Calculating the required points (`S_b`, `S_c`, `N_a`, `I`, tangency points, centers of `ω_b`/`ω_c`, intersection of `ω_b`/`ω_c`, line-line intersection, point on `Ω`) and finally the arc angle involves solving many simultaneous geometric constraints computationally.

- Ensure logical consistency by linking \(N\) to the table and maintaining the Sieve of Sundaram structure.

- **Theme**: Number theory, specifically the properties of factorials and their products, involving prime exponents and conditions for forming squares.  
- **Key Variables**: Upper limit 400 and denominator base 200 (where 200 is half of 400), implying a relationship that may simplify to a square.

- Transform the proof objective into a computational task by focusing on a specific numerical output: compute the exponent of a large prime (chosen as 251, which is near 1000/4 and requires non-trivial summation). This requires applying Legendre's formula iteratively over a large range.

- Add a computational layer by requesting the exponent modulo 10 (i.e., the last digit of the exponent), introducing an integer constraint that forces modulo arithmetic without simplifying the core complexity. This expands the problem to handle large number properties and residue extraction.

- Furoni family: A collection of subsets of $C_n$ forming an antichain (no one subset of another).
- Variables: $a_k$ for $k = 0$ to $n$, counting sets in $F$ of size $k$.
- Sum expression: $\sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{a_k}{\binom{n}{k}} \leq 1$.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. **Increase combinatorial structure complexity**: For fixed large $n$, require computation of a specific numerical value, making it computational. Choose $n=20$ for difficult binomial calculations.
2. **Constraint modification**: Restrict the Furoni family to be **maximal**—no additional subset can be added without violating the antichain property—adding complexity.
3. **Sum minimization**: Instead of proving the inequality, compute the minimum value of the sum over maximal Furoni families to emphasize optimization.
4. **Additional dependency**: Introduce real-world-inspired constraint—the family must exclude the empty set and the full set to avoid trivial cases and force focus on non-extreme sizes.
5. **Ensure logical flow**: Combine elements into a coherent problem statement with specific output.

3.  **Add Parameter & Constraints:** Define *l* as an odd integer such that l > n and l mod 3 ≡ 1. Define a new weighting function for position indices (e.g., assign a weight *ω_i = 1* if *i* is odd, *ω_i = -1* if *i* is even). The positions where *s_i = l* will be crucial.

This integrates the original modulo 4 constraint into a complex counting criterion.

4.  **Choose Parameters for Complexity**: Set `2m = 100` (large, non-trivial) and introduce a small integer `k=5` to play a role in modifying the set counted by `S`. The condition for `S(2m, k)` becomes ""the shortest side has length *exactly* k"" (`k` chosen independently, `k=5` works well). This focus on a specific side length disrupts any simple bijection, forcing consideration of the full mapping's implications on subsets.
5.  **Theme Integration**: Maintain the combinatorial counting theme but intertwine the inherent bijection (implied by `T(2m)=T(2m-3)`) with the new coprime and side-length constraints to create a layered computational challenge involving filtering, set manipulation, and potentially elementary number theory.
6.  **Justification**: The target value `|S(100, k) - T(97)| = |S(100, 5) - T(97)|` is non-trivial to compute (requires significant enumeration or formula application). `T(97) = T(100)` by the proof's core equality. Calculating `S(100, 5)` requires counting triangles with perimeter 100, integer sides, positive area, gcd(sides)=1, and the shortest side exactly 5. The introduction of the coprime constraint makes summing divisors insufficient; it requires including or excluding triangles based on divisibility conditions. The exact side length `k=5` forces focus on a subset of the triangles mapped between the perimeters, making the difference non-zero and intricate.

Step 3
#Rewritten Instruction#:
For each positive integer `n`, let `T(n)` be the number of triangles with integer side lengths and perimeter `n`. Define `S(n, k)` as the number of such triangles for perimeter `n` where the side lengths are pairwise coprime and the shortest side has length exactly `k`. Calculate `|S(100, 5) - T(97)|`.

Step 4
#Finally Rewritten Instruction#:
For each positive integer `n`, let `T(n)` count the triangles with integer side lengths and perimeter `n`. Define `S(n, k)` as the number of such triangles with perimeter `n` having pairwise coprime side lengths and shortest side exactly `k`.

Since $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $b<a+c$ and $a<b+c$ follow automatically, so only $c<a+b$ ever needs to be checked.\n\nInstead of directly considering triangles and sets of triangle, we can consider triples $(a, b, c)$ and sets of triples $(a, b, c)$ with the appropriate conditions.\n\nFor each positive integer $k \\geq 3$, we use the notation $S_{k}$ to denote the set of triples of positive integers $(a, b, c)$ with $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $c<a+b$ and $a+b+c=k$.\n\nIn this case, $c<a+b$ and $a+b+c=k$, so $c+c<a+b+c=k$, so $2 c<k$ or $c<\\frac{1}{2} k$.\n\nAlso, if $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$ and $a+b+c=k$, then $k=a+b+c \\leq c+c+c$, so $3 c \\geq k$ or $c \\geq \\frac{1}{3} k$.\n\nWe show that $T(2 m)=T(2 m-3)$ by creating a one-to-one correspondence between the triples in $S_{2 m}$ and the triples $S_{2 m-3}$.\n\nNote that $S_{2 m}$ is the set of triples $(a, b, c)$ of positive integers with $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$, with $c<a+b$, and with $a+b+c=2 m$.\n\nAlso, $S_{2 m-3}$ is the set of triples $(A, B, C)$ of positive integers with $0<A \\leq B \\leq C$, with $C<A+B$, and with $A+B+C=2 m-3$.\n\nConsider a triple $(a, b, c)$ in $S_{2 m}$ and a corresponding triple $(a-1, b-1, c-1)$.\n\nWe show that $(a-1, b-1, c-1)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$ :\n\n* Since $(a, b, c)$ is in $S_{2 m}$, then $c<\\frac{1}{2}(2 m)=m$. This means that $b \\leq c \\leq m-1$, so $a=2 m-b-c \\geq 2$. Therefore, $a-1, b-1$ and $c-1$ are positive integers since $a, b$ and $c$ are positive integers with $2 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq c$.\n* Since $2 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $1 \\leq a-1 \\leq b-1 \\leq c-1$, so $0<a-1 \\leq b-1 \\leq c-1$.\n* Since $a+b+c=2 m$, then $c=2 m-(a+b)$ so $a+b$ and $c$ have the same parity.\n\nSince $c<a+b$, then $c \\leq a+b-2$.

Here, we allow for the possibility that $k=t$ knowing that the second term in this difference will be 0 in this case.\n\nThe positive integer $k$ has the property that $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{k(t+1)}{k^{2}+1}\\right\\rfloor-\\left\\lfloor\\frac{k t}{k^{2}+1}\\right\\rfloor \\geq 1$ exactly when there is an integer $N$ for which $\\frac{k(t+1)}{k^{2}+1} \\geq N>\\frac{k t}{k^{2}+1}$.\n\n\n\nThis pair of inequalities is equivalent to the pair of inequalities $t+1 \\geq N \\cdot \\frac{k^{2}+1}{k}>t$ which is in turn equivalent to $t+1 \\geq N k+\\frac{N}{k}>t$.\n\nThe following three pairs $(N, k)$ of integers satisfy this equation:\n\n- $k=1$ and $N=\\frac{t+1}{2}$ (noting that $t$ is odd), which give $N k+\\frac{N}{k}=t+1$;\n- $k=r$ and $N=s$, which give $N k+\\frac{N}{k}=r s+\\frac{s}{r}$ (noting that $\\left.\\frac{s}{r}<1\\right)$\n- $k=t$ and $N=1$, which give $N k+\\frac{N}{k}=t+\\frac{1}{t}$.\n\nThis shows that $f(t+1)-f(t) \\geq 3$ when $t$ is odd and composite, as required.']"
