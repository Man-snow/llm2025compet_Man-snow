- **Flexible Components:** Dimensionality (1D sequences), initial values (arbitrary), recurrence structure (max-sum over singletons).

Step 2  
**#Plan#:**  
1. **Increase Dimensionality:** Generalize the sequence to a 2D grid \(a_{m,n}\) with initial conditions given on \(\{(m,n) \mid m+n \leq r\}\). This explodes combinatorial complexity.  
2. **Parametrize Recurrence:** Replace the simple max-sum with a weighted combination: \(a_{m,n} = \max_{\substack{i+j=m \\ k+l=n}} \left( w(i,k) \cdot a_{i,k} + w(j,l) \cdot a_{j,l} \right)\), where \(w(p,q)\) is a non-constant weight function.  
3. **Target Specific Computation:** Instead of proving existence, require computation of the minimal \(N\) such that \(a_{n,n} = a_{n-\ell,n} + a_{\ell,n}\) holds for all \(n \geq N\), for a system with given initial values and weight function \(w(p,q) = p^2 + q + 1\).  
4. **Real-World Constraint:** Use computationally intensive initial values (e.g., prime-indexed terms) to deter trivial solutions.

It is easy to see that each of these two consecutive changes satisfy the conditions of the Lemma, hence the values of $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ increase.\n\nFinally, we come to the situation when $a<b=c=d=e<f$, and we need to prove the inequality\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n2(a+2 b)(2 b+f) & \\geq \\sqrt{3(a+4 b+f)\\left((a+2 b)\\left(b^{2}+2 b f\\right)+(2 b+f)\\left(2 a b+b^{2}\\right)\\right)} \\\\\n& =\\sqrt{3 b(a+4 b+f) \\cdot((a+2 b)(b+2 f)+(2 b+f)(2 a+b)) .}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{8}\n$$\n\nNow, observe that\n\n$$\n2 \\cdot 2(a+2 b)(2 b+f)=3 b(a+4 b+f)+((a+2 b)(b+2 f)+(2 a+b)(2 b+f)) .\n$$\n\n\n\nHence (4) rewrites as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n3 b(a+4 b+f) & +((a+2 b)(b+2 f)+(2 a+b)(2 b+f)) \\\\\n& \\geq 2 \\sqrt{3 b(a+4 b+f) \\cdot((a+2 b)(b+2 f)+(2 b+f)(2 a+b))}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is simply the AM-GM inequality.']"

**#Elements Identified#**:  
- Variables: $n$ (number of players), $w_i$ (wins of $i$-th player), $\ell_i$ (losses of $i$-th player)  
- Conditions: Each pair plays exactly one game with no ties ($n \geq 4$), no ""bad company"" (defined as a group of four players where one loses to the other three, and those three each have one win and one loss against each other)  
- Process: Summing the cube of the difference between wins and losses ($\sum_{i=1}^{n}(w_i - \ell_i)^3$) with the goal of proving it $\geq 0$ under the no-bad-company constraint  
- Theme: Graph theory/tournament combinatorics focusing on win-loss imbalances and constraints on substructures (bad companies)  

### Step 2  
**#Plan#**:  
- **Modify objective**: Transform the proof into a computational problem seeking a specific minimum value, increasing difficulty by adding constraints.  
- **Fix $n$ to a large, non-trivial value**: Set $n = 12$ (large enough to avoid small-case enumeration, but computationally feasible for optimization).  
- **Introduce an asymmetry constraint**: Require at least one player to have a high win count (e.g., $\geq 10$ wins) to force imbalance and prevent the sum from trivially being zero, while maintaining internal consistency with the no-bad-company condition.  
- **Retain core elements**: Use the original bad company definition and sum formula, ensuring the problem remains grounded in the theme.  
- **Ensure coherence**: The added constraint (player with $\geq 10$ wins) relies on tournament outcomes, links to win/loss variances, and increases complexity by making the minimization non-trivial (as it prevents regular/semi-regular win distributions that can achieve sum $= 0$).

We have $a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+a_{4}=\\left(\\begin{array}{l}4 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)=6$, hence $a_{4} \\leq 1$. If $a_{4}=0$, then we cannot have $a_{1}=a_{2}=a_{3}=2$, otherwise the company of all players is bad. Hence we should have $A=(3,2,1,0)$, and $S(T)=3^{3}+1^{3}+(-1)^{3}+(-3)^{3}=0$. On the other hand, if $a_{4}=1$, then only two possibilities, $A=(3,1,1,1)$ and $A=(2,2,1,1)$ can take place. In the former case we have $S(T)=3^{3}+3 \\cdot(-2)^{3}>0$, while in the latter one $S(T)=1^{3}+1^{3}+(-1)^{3}+(-1)^{3}=0$, as desired.\n\nNow we turn to the general problem. Consider a tournament $T$ with no bad companies and enumerate the players by the numbers from 1 to $n$. For every 4 players $i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{3}, i_{4}$ consider a ""sub-tournament"" $T_{i_{1} i_{2} i_{3} i_{4}}$ consisting of only these players and the games which they performed with each other. By the abovementioned, we have $S\\left(T_{i_{1} i_{2} i_{3} i_{4}}\\right) \\geq 0$. Our aim is to prove that\n\n$$\nS(T)=\\sum_{i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{3}, i_{4}} S\\left(T_{i_{1} i_{2} i_{3} i_{4}}\\right)\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all 4 -tuples of distinct numbers from the set $\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$. This way the problem statement will be established.\n\nWe interpret the number $\\left(w_{i}-\\ell_{i}\\right)^{3}$ as following. For $i \\neq j$, let $\\varepsilon_{i j}=1$ if the $i$ th player wins against the $j$ th one, and $\\varepsilon_{i j}=-1$ otherwise. Then\n\n$$\n\\left(w_{i}-\\ell_{i}\\right)^{3}=\\left(\\sum_{j \\neq i} \\varepsilon_{i j}\\right)^{3}=\\sum_{j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3} \\neq i} \\varepsilon_{i j_{1}} \\varepsilon_{i j_{2}} \\varepsilon_{i j_{3}}\n$$\n\nHence,\n\n$$\nS(T)=\\sum_{i \\notin\\left\\{j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3}\\right\\}} \\varepsilon_{i j_{1}} \\varepsilon_{i j_{2}} \\varepsilon_{i j_{3}}\n$$\n\nTo simplify this expression, consider all the terms in this sum where two indices are equal. If, for instance, $j_{1}=j_{2}$, then the term contains $\\varepsilon_{i j_{1}}^{2}=1$, so we can replace this term by $\\varepsilon_{i j_{3}}$. Make such replacements for each such term; obviously, after this change each term of the form $\\varepsilon_{i j_{3}}$ will appear $P(T)$ times, hence\n\n$$\nS(T)=\\sum_{\\left|\\left\\{i, j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3}\\right\\}\\right|=4} \\varepsilon_{i j_{1}} \\varepsilon_{i j_{2}} \\varepsilon_{i j_{3}}+P(T) \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\varepsilon_{i j}=S_{1}(T)+P(T) S_{2}(T)\n$$\n\n\n\nWe show that $S_{2}(T)=0$ and hence $S(T)=S_{1}(T)$ for each tournament. Actually, note that $\\varepsilon_{i j}=-\\varepsilon_{j i}$, and the whole sum can be split into such pairs. Since the sum in each pair is 0 , so is $S_{2}(T)$.\n\nThus the desired equality (2) rewrites as\n\n$$\nS_{1}(T)=\\sum_{i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{3}, i_{4}} S_{1}\\left(T_{i_{1} i_{2} i_{3} i_{4}}\\right)\n\\tag{3}\n$$\n\nNow, if all the numbers $j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3}$ are distinct, then the set $\\left\\{i, j_{1}, j_{2}, j_{3}\\right\\}$ is contained in exactly one 4-tuple, hence the term $\\varepsilon_{i j_{1}} \\varepsilon_{i j_{2}} \\varepsilon_{i j_{3}}$ appears in the right-hand part of (3) exactly once, as well as in the left-hand part. Clearly, there are no other terms in both parts, so the equality is established.'
 ""Similarly to the first solution, we call the subsets of players as companies, and the $k$-element subsets will be called as $k$-companies.\n\nIn any company of the players, call a player the local champion of the company if he defeated all other members of the company. Similarly, if a player lost all his games against the others in the company then call him the local loser of the company. Obviously every company has at most one local champion and at most one local loser. By the condition of the problem, whenever a 4-company has a local loser, then this company has a local champion as well.\n\nSuppose that $k$ is some positive integer, and let us count all cases when a player is the local champion of some $k$-company. The $i$ th player won against $w_{i}$ other player. To be the local champion of a $k$-company, he must be a member of the company, and the other $k-1$ members must be chosen from those whom he defeated. Therefore, the $i$ th player is the local champion of $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}w_{i} \\\\ k-1\\end{array}\\right) k$-companies.

1727,"Given a positive integer $k$ and other two integers $b>w>1$. There are two strings of pearls, a string of $b$ black pearls and a string of $w$ white pearls. The length of a string is the number of pearls on it.

One cuts these strings in some steps by the following rules. In each step:

(i) The strings are ordered by their lengths in a non-increasing order. If there are some strings of equal lengths, then the white ones precede the black ones. Then $k$ first ones (if they consist of more than one pearl) are chosen; if there are less than $k$ strings longer than 1 , then one chooses all of them.

(ii) Next, one cuts each chosen string into two parts differing in length by at most one.

(For instance, if there are strings of 5, 4, 4, 2 black pearls, strings of $8,4,3$ white pearls and $k=4$, then the strings of 8 white, 5 black, 4 white and 4 black pearls are cut into the parts $(4,4),(3,2),(2,2)$ and $(2,2)$, respectively.)

The process stops immediately after the step when a first isolated white pearl appears. Prove that at this stage, there will still exist a string of at least two black pearls.","Given a positive integer \(k\) and sequences \(B = [b_1, \dots, b_\mu]\), \(W = [w_1, \dots, w_\nu]\), \(\mu + \nu \geq 3\), all \(b_i, w_j > 1\), with \(T = \sum b_i + \sum w_j\) divisible by \(k\). Initially, separate strings: black lengths \(B\), white lengths \(W\). Each step:  
(i) Order strings by length non-increasing; whites precede blacks for ties. Select first min(\(s, k\)) strings \(> 1\), where \(s\) is their count.  
(ii) Cut each selected string into two parts differing in length by at most one.  
The process stops immediately after a step where any white string of size 1 appears. Compute the minimum size among black strings of size at least 2 at this instant.","Step 1  
#Elements Identified#:  
- Core variables: Positive integer \(k\), integers \(b > w > 1\) (pearl counts).  
- Participants: Two strings: one black with \(b\) pearls, one white with \(w\) pearls, all pearls initially in these strings.  
- Conditions: Strings ordered by length non-increasingly; white precedes black for equal lengths; up to \(k\) longest strings >1 are cut per step.  
- Actions: Cutting a string splits it into two parts differing in length by at most one.  
- Process: Iterative cutting until the first isolated white pearl (size 1) appears.  
- Output: Proof that at this stop point, at least one black string of size ≥2 exists.  
- Theme: Invariant properties during a deterministic sequence of cuts based on ordering rules.  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
- Expand participants: Generalize to multiple initial strings of varying lengths for both colors, increasing state complexity and interdependency. Specifically, replace \(b\) and \(w\) with lists \(B = [b_1, \dots, b_\mu]\) for black and \(W = [w_1, \dots, w_\nu]\) for white, all elements >1, forcing heterogeneous starting conditions.  
- Incorporate recursive dependency: Add a new computational variable: the total number of pearls \(T = \sum b_i + \sum w_j\), with \(T\) mod \(k\) constraining the process (e.g., by affecting initial string counts).  
- Change output to computational: Instead of proof, compute a specific difficult value: the minimum size among all black strings of size ≥2 at the stop point (defaulting to a large number if none exist, though the proof implies it should). This requires full simulation to track all string states and identify critical minima.  
- Justify complexity: Multiple strings and varying lengths interact with ordering/cutting rules, demanding detailed state tracking. Adding \(T\) mod \(k\) creates a modulus-based constraint that influences string counts and cut selection. Computing the minimum size ≥2 is harder than its existence, as it quantifies fragmentation resilience and involves global optimization over the cut sequence.  

Step 3  
#Rewritten Instruction#:  
Given a positive integer \(k\) and sequences \(B = [b_1, \dots, b_\mu]\), \(W = [w_1, \dots, w_\nu]\), \(\mu + \nu \geq 3\), all \(b_i, w_j > 1\), with \(T = \sum_{i=1}^\mu b_i + \sum_{j=1}^\nu w_j\) such that \(T \mod k = 0\). Initially separate strings: black of lengths \(b_i\), white of lengths \(w_j\). Each step:  
(i) Order strings by length (non-increasing); whites precede blacks for ties. Select first min(\(s, k\)) strings longer than 1, where \(s\) is the count of such.  
(ii) Cut each selected string into two parts differing in length by at most one.  
The process stops immediately after a step where an isolated white pearl appears. Compute the minimum size among black strings of size at least 2 at this instant; if no such black string exists, output infinity.

We call a string containing $m$ pearls an $m$-string; it is an $m$-w-string or a $m$-b-string if it is white or black, respectively.\n\nWe continue the process until every string consists of a single pearl. We will focus on three moments of the process: (a) the first stage $A_{s}$ when the first 1-string (no matter black or white) appears; (b) the first stage $A_{t}$ where the total number of strings is greater than $k$ (if such moment does not appear then we put $t=\\infty$ ); and (c) the first stage $A_{f}$ when all black pearls are isolated. It is sufficient to prove that in $A_{f-1}$ (or earlier), a 1-w-string appears.\n\nWe start with some easy properties of the situations under consideration. Obviously, we have $s \\leq f$. Moreover, all b-strings from $A_{f-1}$ become single pearls in the $f$ th step, hence all of them are 1 - or 2 -b-strings.\n\nNext, observe that in each step $A_{i} \\rightarrow A_{i+1}$ with $i \\leq t-1$, all $(>1)$-strings were cut since there are not more than $k$ strings at all; if, in addition, $i<s$, then there were no 1 -string, so all the strings were cut in this step.\n\nNow, let $B_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ be the lengths of the longest and the shortest b-strings in $A_{i}$, and let $W_{i}$ and $w_{i}$ be the same for w-strings. We show by induction on $i \\leq \\min \\{s, t\\}$ that (i) the situation $A_{i}$ contains exactly $2^{i}$ black and $2^{i}$ white strings, (ii) $B_{i} \\geq W_{i}$, and (iii) $b_{i} \\geq w_{i}$. The base case $i=0$ is obvious. For the induction step, if $i \\leq \\min \\{s, t\\}$ then in the $i$ th step, each string is cut, thus the claim (i) follows from the induction hypothesis; next, we have $B_{i}=\\left\\lceil B_{i-1} / 2\\right\\rceil \\geq\\left\\lceil W_{i-1} / 2\\right\\rceil=W_{i}$ and $b_{i}=\\left\\lfloor b_{i-1} / 2\\right\\rfloor \\geq\\left\\lfloor w_{i-1} / 2\\right\\rfloor=w_{i}$, thus establishing (ii) and (iii).\n\nFor the numbers $s, t, f$, two cases are possible.\n\nCase 1. Suppose that $s \\leq t$ or $f \\leq t+1$ (and hence $s \\leq t+1$ ); in particular, this is true when $t=\\infty$. Then in $A_{s-1}$ we have $B_{s-1} \\geq W_{s-1}, b_{s-1} \\geq w_{s-1}>1$ as $s-1 \\leq \\min \\{s, t\\}$. Now, if $s=f$, then in $A_{s-1}$, there is no $1-\\mathrm{w}$-string as well as no $(>2)$-b-string. That is, $2=B_{s-1} \\geq W_{s-1} \\geq b_{s-1} \\geq w_{s-1}>1$, hence all these numbers equal 2 . This means that in $A_{s-1}$, all strings contain 2 pearls, and there are $2^{s-1}$ black and $2^{s-1}$ white strings, which means $b=2 \\cdot 2^{s-1}=w$. This contradicts the problem conditions.\n\nHence we have $s \\leq f-1$ and thus $s \\leq t$. Therefore, in the $s$ th step each string is cut into two parts. Now, if a 1-b-string appears in this step, then from $w_{s-1} \\leq b_{s-1}$ we see that a 1-w-string appears as well; so, in each case in the sth step a 1-w-string appears, while not all black pearls become single, as desired.\n\nCase 2. Now assume that $t+1 \\leq s$ and $t+2 \\leq f$. Then in $A_{t}$ we have exactly $2^{t}$ white and $2^{t}$ black strings, all being larger than 1 , and $2^{t+1}>k \\geq 2^{t}$ (the latter holds since $2^{t}$ is the total number of strings in $\\left.A_{t-1}\\right)$. Now, in the $(t+1)$ st step, exactly $k$ strings are cut, not more than $2^{t}$ of them being black; so the number of w-strings in $A_{t+1}$ is at least $2^{t}+\\left(k-2^{t}\\right)=k$. Since the number of w-strings does not decrease in our process, in $A_{f-1}$ we have at least $k$ white strings as well.\n\nFinally, in $A_{f-1}$, all b-strings are not larger than 2, and at least one 2-b-string is cut in the $f$ th step. Therefore, at most $k-1$ white strings are cut in this step, hence there exists a w-string $\\mathcal{W}$ which is not cut in the $f$ th step. On the other hand, since a 2 -b-string is cut, all $(\\geq 2)$-w-strings should also be cut in the $f$ th step; hence $\\mathcal{W}$ should be a single pearl. This is exactly what we needed.'
 'We use the same notations as introduced in the first paragraph of the previous solution. We claim that at every stage, there exist a $u$-b-string and a $v$-w-string such that either\n\n(i) $u>v \\geq 1$, or\n\n(ii) $2 \\leq u \\leq v<2 u$, and there also exist $k-1$ of $(>v / 2)$-strings other than considered above.\n\nFirst, we notice that this statement implies the problem statement. Actually, in both cases (i) and (ii) we have $u>1$, so at each stage there exists a $(\\geq 2)$-b-string, and for the last stage it is exactly what we need.\n\nNow, we prove the claim by induction on the number of the stage. Obviously, for $A_{0}$ the condition (i) holds since $b>w$. Further, we suppose that the statement holds for $A_{i}$, and prove it for $A_{i+1}$. Two cases are possible.\n\nCase 1. Assume that in $A_{i}$, there are a $u$-b-string and a $v$-w-string with $u>v$. We can assume that $v$ is the length of the shortest w-string in $A_{i}$; since we are not at the final stage, we have $v \\geq 2$. Now, in the $(i+1)$ st step, two subcases may occur.\n\nSubcase 1a. Suppose that either no $u$-b-string is cut, or both some $u$-b-string and some $v$-w-string are cut. Then in $A_{i+1}$, we have either a $u$-b-string and a $(\\leq v)$-w-string (and (i) is valid), or we have a $\\lceil u / 2\\rceil$-b-string and a $\\lfloor v / 2\\rfloor$-w-string. In the latter case, from $u>v$ we get $\\lceil u / 2\\rceil>\\lfloor v / 2\\rfloor$, and (i) is valid again.\n\nSubcase 1b. Now, some $u$-b-string is cut, and no $v$-w-string is cut (and hence all the strings which are cut are longer than $v$ ). If $u^{\\prime}=\\lceil u / 2\\rceil>v$, then the condition (i) is satisfied since we have a $u^{\\prime}$-b-string and a $v$-w-string in $A_{i+1}$. Otherwise, notice that the inequality $u>v \\geq 2$ implies $u^{\\prime} \\geq 2$. Furthermore, besides a fixed $u$-b-string, other $k-1$ of $(\\geq v+1)$-strings should be cut in the $(i+1)$ st step, hence providing at least $k-1$ of $(\\geq\\lceil(v+1) / 2\\rceil)$-strings, and $\\lceil(v+1) / 2\\rceil>v / 2$. So, we can put $v^{\\prime}=v$, and we have $u^{\\prime} \\leq v<u \\leq 2 u^{\\prime}$, so the condition (ii) holds for $A_{i+1}$.\n\nCase 2. Conversely, assume that in $A_{i}$ there exist a $u$-b-string, a $v$-w-string $(2 \\leq u \\leq v<2 u)$ and a set $S$ of $k-1$ other strings larger than $v / 2$ (and hence larger than 1 ). In the $(i+1)$ st step, three subcases may occur.\n\nSubcase 2a. Suppose that some $u$-b-string is not cut, and some $v$-w-string is cut. The latter one results in a $\\lfloor v / 2\\rfloor$-w-string, we have $v^{\\prime}=\\lfloor v / 2\\rfloor<u$, and the condition (i) is valid.\n\n\n\nSubcase 2b. Next, suppose that no $v$-w-string is cut (and therefore no $u$-b-string is cut as $u \\leq v)$. Then all $k$ strings which are cut have the length $>v$, so each one results in a $(>v / 2)$ string. Hence in $A_{i+1}$, there exist $k \\geq k-1$ of $(>v / 2)$-strings other than the considered $u$ - and $v$-strings, and the condition (ii) is satisfied.\n\nSubcase 2c. In the remaining case, all $u$-b-strings are cut. This means that all $(\\geq u)$-strings are cut as well, hence our $v$-w-string is cut. Therefore in $A_{i+1}$ there exists a $[u / 2]$-b-string together with a $\\lfloor v / 2\\rfloor$-w-string. Now, if $u^{\\prime}=\\lceil u / 2\\rceil>\\lfloor v / 2\\rfloor=v^{\\prime}$ then the condition (i) is fulfilled. Otherwise, we have $u^{\\prime} \\leq v^{\\prime}<u \\leq 2 u^{\\prime}$. In this case, we show that $u^{\\prime} \\geq 2$. If, to the contrary, $u^{\\prime}=1$ (and hence $u=2$ ), then all black and white $(\\geq 2)$-strings should be cut in the $(i+1)$ st step, and among these strings there are at least a $u$-b-string, a $v$-w-string, and $k-1$ strings in $S$ ( $k+1$ strings altogether). This is impossible.\n\nHence, we get $2 \\leq u^{\\prime} \\leq v^{\\prime}<2 u^{\\prime}$. To reach (ii), it remains to check that in $A_{i+1}$, there exists a set $S^{\\prime}$ of $k-1$ other strings larger than $v^{\\prime} / 2$. These will be exactly the strings obtained from the elements of $S$. Namely, each $s \\in S$ was either cut in the $(i+1)$ st step, or not. In the former case, let us include into $S^{\\prime}$ the largest of the strings obtained from $s$; otherwise we include $s$ itself into $S^{\\prime}$. All $k-1$ strings in $S^{\\prime}$ are greater than $v / 2 \\geq v^{\\prime}$, as desired.']"

2.  **Change Goal to Computation:** Instead of proving a lower bound inequality, require computation of the *exact minimum possible* $s$ under concrete constraints.
3.  **Add Constraint on Progressions:** Demand that each progression $P_j$ must contain a specific multiple of its step $d_j$ (where $d_j \mid n$) at a position congruent to a given fixed offset modulo $d_j$, creating interdependence.
4.  **Modify Uniqueness Condition:** Replace the single uniqueness point condition with the *stronger* requirement that the *first occurrence* (smallest positive integer) exclusively contained in $P_j$ must itself be a divisor of $n$. This significantly complicates balancing coverage and uniqueness.
5.  **Enforce Interdependence:** Ensure the constraints in (3) and (4) relate directly to the prime factors of the chosen `n`. This connects the choice of progression steps/offsets and their uniqueness points directly to $n$'s factorization structure.

#Rewritten Instruction#:
Given $n = 2520 = 2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$, consider arithmetic progressions $P_{1}, \ldots, P_{s}$ $(\text{step } d_j \gcd(d_j, n)=d_j)$ covering all integers where each $P_j$ contains a multiple of $d_j$ at position $d_j$ modulo $d_j$, and the first integer unique to $P_j$ is a divisor of $n$. Find the minimum $s$.

Let $n = 2520 = 2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$. Consider arithmetic progressions $P_{1}, \ldots, P_{s}$ of integers satisfying:
(i) Every integer belongs to at least one $P_j$;
(ii) The first integer uniquely contained in $P_j$ (smallest positive integer belonging only to $P_j$) is a divisor of $n$;
(iii) $P_j$ contains the integer $d_j$ (hence $d_j \mid n$).
Determine the minimal possible number $s$ of such progressions.",success,26.79,"[""First, we prove the key lemma, and then we show how to apply it to finish the solution.\n\nLet $n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{k}$ be positive integers. By an $n_{1} \\times n_{2} \\times \\cdots \\times n_{k}$ grid we mean the set $N=$ $\\left\\{\\left(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{k}\\right): a_{i} \\in \\mathbb{Z}, 0 \\leq a_{i} \\leq n_{i}-1\\right\\}$; the elements of $N$ will be referred to as points. In this grid, we define a subgrid as a subset of the form\n\n$$\nL=\\left\\{\\left(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{k}\\right) \\in N: b_{i_{1}}=x_{i_{1}}, \\ldots, b_{i_{t}}=x_{i_{t}}\\right\\}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nwhere $I=\\left\\{i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{t}\\right\\}$ is an arbitrary nonempty set of indices, and $x_{i_{j}} \\in\\left[0, n_{i_{j}}-1\\right](1 \\leq j \\leq t)$ are fixed integer numbers. Further, we say that a subgrid (1) is orthogonal to the $i$ th coordinate axis if $i \\in I$, and that it is parallel to the $i$ th coordinate axis otherwise.\n\nLemma. Assume that the grid $N$ is covered by subgrids $L_{1}, L_{2}, \\ldots, L_{s}$ (this means $N=\\bigcup_{i=1}^{s} L_{i}$ ) so that\n\n(ii') each subgrid contains a point which is not covered by other subgrids;\n\n(iii) for each coordinate axis, there exists a subgrid $L_{i}$ orthogonal to this axis.\n\nThen\n\n$$\ns \\geq 1+\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\left(n_{i}-1\\right)\n$$\n\nProof. Assume to the contrary that $s \\leq \\sum_{i}\\left(n_{i}-1\\right)=s^{\\prime}$. Our aim is to find a point that is not covered by $L_{1}, \\ldots, L_{s}$.\n\nThe idea of the proof is the following. Imagine that we expand each subgrid to some maximal subgrid so that for the $i$ th axis, there will be at most $n_{i}-1$ maximal subgrids orthogonal to this axis. Then the desired point can be found easily: its $i$ th coordinate should be that not covered by the maximal subgrids orthogonal to the $i$ th axis. Surely, the conditions for existence of such expansion are provided by Hall's lemma on matchings. So, we will follow this direction, although we will apply Hall's lemma to some subgraph instead of the whole graph.\n\nConstruct a bipartite graph $G=\\left(V \\cup V^{\\prime}, E\\right)$ as follows. Let $V=\\left\\{L_{1}, \\ldots, L_{s}\\right\\}$, and let $V^{\\prime}=\\left\\{v_{i j}: 1 \\leq i \\leq s, 1 \\leq j \\leq n_{i}-1\\right\\}$ be some set of $s^{\\prime}$ elements. Further, let the edge $\\left(L_{m}, v_{i j}\\right)$ appear iff $L_{m}$ is orthogonal to the $i$ th axis.\n\nFor each subset $W \\subset V$, denote\n\n$$\nf(W)=\\left\\{v \\in V^{\\prime}:(L, v) \\in E \\text { for some } L \\in W\\right\\}\n$$\n\nNotice that $f(V)=V^{\\prime}$ by (iii).\n\nNow, consider the set $W \\subset V$ containing the maximal number of elements such that $|W|>$ $|f(W)|$; if there is no such set then we set $W=\\varnothing$. Denote $W^{\\prime}=f(W), U=V \\backslash W, U^{\\prime}=V^{\\prime} \\backslash W^{\\prime}$.\n\n\n\nBy our assumption and the Lemma condition, $|f(V)|=\\left|V^{\\prime}\\right| \\geq|V|$, hence $W \\neq V$ and $U \\neq \\varnothing$. Permuting the coordinates, we can assume that $U^{\\prime}=\\left\\{v_{i j}: 1 \\leq i \\leq \\ell\\right\\}, W^{\\prime}=\\left\\{v_{i j}: \\ell+1 \\leq i \\leq k\\right\\}$.\n\nConsider the induced subgraph $G^{\\prime}$ of $G$ on the vertices $U \\cup U^{\\prime}$. We claim that for every $X \\subset U$, we get $\\left|f(X) \\cap U^{\\prime}\\right| \\geq|X|$ (so $G^{\\prime}$ satisfies the conditions of Hall's lemma). Actually, we have $|W| \\geq|f(W)|$, so if $|X|>\\left|f(X) \\cap U^{\\prime}\\right|$ for some $X \\subset U$, then we have\n\n$$\n|W \\cup X|=|W|+|X|>|f(W)|+\\left|f(X) \\cap U^{\\prime}\\right|=\\left|f(W) \\cup\\left(f(X) \\cap U^{\\prime}\\right)\\right|=|f(W \\cup X)|\n$$\n\nThis contradicts the maximality of $|W|$.\n\nThus, applying Hall's lemma, we can assign to each $L \\in U$ some vertex $v_{i j} \\in U^{\\prime}$ so that to distinct elements of $U$, distinct vertices of $U^{\\prime}$ are assigned. In this situation, we say that $L \\in U$ corresponds to the $i$ th axis, and write $g(L)=i$. Since there are $n_{i}-1$ vertices of the form $v_{i j}$, we get that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq \\ell$, not more than $n_{i}-1$ subgrids correspond to the $i$ th axis.\n\nFinally, we are ready to present the desired point. Since $W \\neq V$, there exists a point $b=\\left(b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{k}\\right) \\in N \\backslash\\left(\\cup_{L \\in W} L\\right)$. On the other hand, for every $1 \\leq i \\leq \\ell$, consider any subgrid $L \\in U$ with $g(L)=i$. This means exactly that $L$ is orthogonal to the $i$ th axis, and hence all its elements have the same $i$ th coordinate $c_{L}$. Since there are at most $n_{i}-1$ such subgrids, there exists a number $0 \\leq a_{i} \\leq n_{i}-1$ which is not contained in a set $\\left\\{c_{L}: g(L)=i\\right\\}$. Choose such number for every $1 \\leq i \\leq \\ell$. Now we claim that point $a=\\left(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{\\ell}, b_{\\ell+1}, \\ldots, b_{k}\\right)$ is not covered, hence contradicting the Lemma condition.\n\nSurely, point $a$ cannot lie in some $L \\in U$, since all the points in $L$ have $g(L)$ th coordinate $c_{L} \\neq a_{g(L)}$. On the other hand, suppose that $a \\in L$ for some $L \\in W$; recall that $b \\notin L$. But the points $a$ and $b$ differ only at first $\\ell$ coordinates, so $L$ should be orthogonal to at least one of the first $\\ell$ axes, and hence our graph contains some edge $\\left(L, v_{i j}\\right)$ for $i \\leq \\ell$. It contradicts the definition of $W^{\\prime}$. The Lemma is proved.\n\nNow we turn to the problem. Let $d_{j}$ be the step of the progression $P_{j}$. Note that since $n=$ l.c.m. $\\left(d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{s}\\right)$, for each $1 \\leq i \\leq k$ there exists an index $j(i)$ such that $p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}} \\mid d_{j(i)}$. We assume that $n>1$; otherwise the problem statement is trivial.\n\nFor each $0 \\leq m \\leq n-1$ and $1 \\leq i \\leq k$, let $m_{i}$ be the residue of $m$ modulo $p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}}$, and let $m_{i}=\\overline{r_{i \\alpha_{i}} \\ldots r_{i 1}}$ be the base $p_{i}$ representation of $m_{i}$ (possibly, with some leading zeroes). Now, we put into correspondence to $m$ the sequence $r(m)=\\left(r_{11}, \\ldots, r_{1 \\alpha_{1}}, r_{21}, \\ldots, r_{k \\alpha_{k}}\\right)$. Hence $r(m)$ lies in a $\\underbrace{p_{1} \\times \\cdots \\times p_{1}}_{\\alpha_{1} \\text { times }} \\times \\cdots \\times \\underbrace{p_{k} \\times \\cdots \\times p_{k}}_{\\alpha_{k} \\text { times }} \\operatorname{grid} N$.\n\nSurely, if $r(m)=r\\left(m^{\\prime}\\right)$ then $p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}} \\mid m_{i}-m_{i}^{\\prime}$, which follows $p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}} \\mid m-m^{\\prime}$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq k$; consequently, $n \\mid m-m^{\\prime}$. So, when $m$ runs over the set $\\{0, \\ldots, n-1\\}$, the sequences $r(m)$ do not repeat; since $|N|=n$, this means that $r$ is a bijection between $\\{0, \\ldots, n-1\\}$ and $N$. Now we will show that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq s$, the set $L_{i}=\\left\\{r(m): m \\in P_{i}\\right\\}$ is a subgrid, and that for each axis there exists a subgrid orthogonal to this axis. Obviously, these subgrids cover $N$, and the condition (ii') follows directly from (ii). Hence the Lemma provides exactly the estimate we need.\n\nConsider some $1 \\leq j \\leq s$ and let $d_{j}=p_{1}^{\\gamma_{1}} \\ldots p_{k}^{\\gamma_{k}}$. Consider some $q \\in P_{j}$ and let $r(q)=$ $\\left(r_{11}, \\ldots, r_{k \\alpha_{k}}\\right)$. Then for an arbitrary $q^{\\prime}$, setting $r\\left(q^{\\prime}\\right)=\\left(r_{11}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, r_{k \\alpha_{k}}^{\\prime}\\right)$ we have\n\n$$\nq^{\\prime} \\in P_{j} \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad p_{i}^{\\gamma_{i}} \\mid q-q^{\\prime} \\text { for each } 1 \\leq i \\leq k \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad r_{i, t}=r_{i, t}^{\\prime} \\text { for all } t \\leq \\gamma_{i} \\text {. }\n$$\n\nHence $L_{j}=\\left\\{\\left(r_{11}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, r_{k \\alpha_{k}}^{\\prime}\\right) \\in N: r_{i, t}=r_{i, t}^{\\prime}\\right.$ for all $\\left.t \\leq \\gamma_{i}\\right\\}$ which means that $L_{j}$ is a subgrid containing $r(q)$. Moreover, in $L_{j(i)}$, all the coordinates corresponding to $p_{i}$ are fixed, so it is orthogonal to all of their axes, as desired.""
 ""We start with introducing some notation. For positive integer $r$, we denote $[r]=\\{1,2, \\ldots, r\\}$. Next, we say that a set of progressions $\\mathcal{P}=\\left\\{P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{s}\\right\\}$ cover $\\mathbb{Z}$ if each integer belongs to some of them; we say that this covering is minimal if no proper subset of $\\mathcal{P}$ covers $\\mathbb{Z}$. Obviously, each covering contains a minimal subcovering.\n\nNext, for a minimal covering $\\left\\{P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{s}\\right\\}$ and for every $1 \\leq i \\leq s$, let $d_{i}$ be the step of progression $P_{i}$, and $h_{i}$ be some number which is contained in $P_{i}$ but in none of the other progressions. We assume that $n>1$, otherwise the problem is trivial. This implies $d_{i}>1$, otherwise the progression $P_{i}$ covers all the numbers, and $n=1$.\n\nWe will prove a more general statement, namely the following\n\nClaim. Assume that the progressions $P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{s}$ and number $n=p_{1}^{\\alpha_{1}} \\ldots p_{k}^{\\alpha_{k}}>1$ are chosen as in the problem statement. Moreover, choose some nonempty set of indices $I=\\left\\{i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{t}\\right\\} \\subseteq[k]$ and some positive integer $\\beta_{i} \\leq \\alpha_{i}$ for every $i \\in I$. Consider the set of indices\n\n$$\nT=\\left\\{j: 1 \\leq j \\leq s, \\text { and } p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}-\\beta_{i}+1} \\mid d_{j} \\text { for some } i \\in I\\right\\} .\n$$\n\nThen\n\n$$\n|T| \\geq 1+\\sum_{i \\in I} \\beta_{i}\\left(p_{i}-1\\right)\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nObserve that the Claim for $I=[k]$ and $\\beta_{i}=\\alpha_{i}$ implies the problem statement, since the left-hand side in (2) is not greater than $s$. Hence, it suffices to prove the Claim.\n\n1. First, we prove the Claim assuming that all $d_{j}$ 's are prime numbers. If for some $1 \\leq i \\leq k$ we have at least $p_{i}$ progressions with the step $p_{i}$, then they do not intersect and hence cover all the integers; it means that there are no other progressions, and $n=p_{i}$; the Claim is trivial in this case.\n\nNow assume that for every $1 \\leq i \\leq k$, there are not more than $p_{i}-1$ progressions with step $p_{i}$; each such progression covers the numbers with a fixed residue modulo $p_{i}$, therefore there exists a residue $q_{i} \\bmod p_{i}$ which is not touched by these progressions. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there exists a number $q$ such that $q \\equiv q_{i}\\left(\\bmod p_{i}\\right)$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq k$; this number cannot be covered by any progression with step $p_{i}$, hence it is not covered at all. A contradiction.\n\n\n\n2. Now, we assume that the general Claim is not valid, and hence we consider a counterexample $\\left\\{P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{s}\\right\\}$ for the Claim; we can choose it to be minimal in the following sense:\n\n- the number $n$ is minimal possible among all the counterexamples; of $n$.\n- the sum $\\sum_{i} d_{i}$ is minimal possible among all the counterexamples having the chosen value\n\nAs was mentioned above, not all numbers $d_{i}$ are primes; hence we can assume that $d_{1}$ is composite, say $p_{1} \\mid d_{1}$ and $d_{1}^{\\prime}=\\frac{d_{1}}{p_{1}}>1$. Consider a progression $P_{1}^{\\prime}$ having the step $d_{1}^{\\prime}$, and containing $P_{1}$. We will focus on two coverings constructed as follows.\n\n(i) Surely, the progressions $P_{1}^{\\prime}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{s}$ cover $\\mathbb{Z}$, though this covering in not necessarily minimal. So, choose some minimal subcovering $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ in it; surely $P_{1}^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ since $h_{1}$ is not covered by $P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{s}$, so we may assume that $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}=\\left\\{P_{1}^{\\prime}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{s^{\\prime}}\\right\\}$ for some $s^{\\prime} \\leq s$. Furthermore, the period of the covering $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ can appear to be less than $n$; so we denote this period by\n\n$$\nn^{\\prime}=p_{1}^{\\alpha_{1}-\\sigma_{1}} \\ldots p_{k}^{\\alpha_{k}-\\sigma_{k}}=\\text { l.c.m. }\\left(d_{1}^{\\prime}, d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{s^{\\prime}}\\right)\n$$\n\nObserve that for each $P_{j} \\notin \\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$, we have $h_{j} \\in P_{1}^{\\prime}$, otherwise $h_{j}$ would not be covered by $\\mathcal{P}$.\n\n(ii) On the other hand, each nonempty set of the form $R_{i}=P_{i} \\cap P_{1}^{\\prime}(1 \\leq i \\leq s)$ is also a progression with a step $r_{i}=$ l.c.m. $\\left(d_{i}, d_{1}^{\\prime}\\right)$, and such sets cover $P_{1}^{\\prime}$. Scaling these progressions with the ratio $1 / d_{1}^{\\prime}$, we obtain the progressions $Q_{i}$ with steps $q_{i}=r_{i} / d_{1}^{\\prime}$ which cover $\\mathbb{Z}$. Now we choose a minimal subcovering $\\mathcal{Q}$ of this covering; again we should have $Q_{1} \\in \\mathcal{Q}$ by the reasons of $h_{1}$. Now, denote the period of $\\mathcal{Q}$ by\n\n$$\nn^{\\prime \\prime}=\\text { l.c.m. }\\left\\{q_{i}: Q_{i} \\in \\mathcal{Q}\\right\\}=\\frac{\\text { l.c.m. }\\left\\{r_{i}: Q_{i} \\in \\mathcal{Q}\\right\\}}{d_{1}^{\\prime}}=\\frac{p_{1}^{\\gamma_{1}} \\ldots p_{k}^{\\gamma_{k}}}{d_{1}^{\\prime}} \\text {. }\n$$\n\nNote that if $h_{j} \\in P_{1}^{\\prime}$, then the image of $h_{j}$ under the scaling can be covered by $Q_{j}$ only; so, in this case we have $Q_{j} \\in \\mathcal{Q}$.\n\nOur aim is to find the desired number of progressions in coverings $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\mathcal{Q}$. First, we have $n \\geq n^{\\prime}$, and the sum of the steps in $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ is less than that in $\\mathcal{P}$; hence the Claim is valid for $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$. We apply it to the set of indices $I^{\\prime}=\\left\\{i \\in I: \\beta_{i}>\\sigma_{i}\\right\\}$ and the exponents $\\beta_{i}^{\\prime}=\\beta_{i}-\\sigma_{i}$; hence the set under consideration is\n\n$$\nT^{\\prime}=\\left\\{j: 1 \\leq j \\leq s^{\\prime}, \\text { and } p_{i}^{\\left(\\alpha_{i}-\\sigma_{i}\\right)-\\beta_{i}^{\\prime}+1}=p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}-\\beta_{i}+1} \\mid d_{j} \\text { for some } i \\in I^{\\prime}\\right\\} \\subseteq T \\cap\\left[s^{\\prime}\\right] \\text {, }\n$$\n\nand we obtain that\n\n$$\n\\left|T \\cap\\left[s^{\\prime}\\right]\\right| \\geq\\left|T^{\\prime}\\right| \\geq 1+\\sum_{i \\in I^{\\prime}}\\left(\\beta_{i}-\\sigma_{i}\\right)\\left(p_{i}-1\\right)=1+\\sum_{i \\in I}\\left(\\beta_{i}-\\sigma_{i}\\right)_{+}\\left(p_{i}-1\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $(x)_{+}=\\max \\{x, 0\\}$; the latter equality holds as for $i \\notin I^{\\prime}$ we have $\\beta_{i} \\leq \\sigma_{i}$.\n\nObserve that $x=(x-y)_{+}+\\min \\{x, y\\}$ for all $x, y$. So, if we find at least\n\n$$\nG=\\sum_{i \\in I} \\min \\left\\{\\beta_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right\\}\\left(p_{i}-1\\right)\n$$\n\nindices in $T \\cap\\left\\{s^{\\prime}+1, \\ldots, s\\right\\}$, then we would have\n\n$|T|=\\left|T \\cap\\left[s^{\\prime}\\right]\\right|+\\left|T \\cap\\left\\{s^{\\prime}+1, \\ldots, s\\right\\}\\right| \\geq 1+\\sum_{i \\in I}\\left(\\left(\\beta_{i}-\\sigma_{i}\\right)_{+}+\\min \\left\\{\\beta_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right\\}\\right)\\left(p_{i}-1\\right)=1+\\sum_{i \\in I} \\beta_{i}\\left(p_{i}-1\\right)$,\n\nthus leading to a contradiction with the choice of $\\mathcal{P}$. We will find those indices among the indices of progressions in $\\mathcal{Q}$.\n\n\n\n3. Now denote $I^{\\prime \\prime}=\\left\\{i \\in I: \\sigma_{i}>0\\right\\}$ and consider some $i \\in I^{\\prime \\prime}$; then $p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}} \\nmid n^{\\prime}.$. On the other hand, there exists an index $j(i)$ such that $p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}} \\mid d_{j(i)}$; this means that $d_{j(i)} \\nmid n^{\\prime}$ and hence $P_{j(i)}$ cannot appear in $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$, so $j(i)>s^{\\prime}$. Moreover, we have observed before that in this case $h_{j(i)} \\in P_{1}^{\\prime}$, hence $Q_{j(i)} \\in \\mathcal{Q}$. This means that $q_{j(i)} \\mid n^{\\prime \\prime}$, therefore $\\gamma_{i}=\\alpha_{i}$ for each $i \\in I^{\\prime \\prime}$ (recall here that $q_{i}=r_{i} / d_{1}^{\\prime}$ and hence $\\left.d_{j(i)}\\left|r_{j(i)}\\right| d_{1}^{\\prime} n^{\\prime \\prime}\\right)$.\n\nLet $d_{1}^{\\prime}=p_{1}^{\\tau_{1}} \\ldots p_{k}^{\\tau_{k}}$. Then $n^{\\prime \\prime}=p_{1}^{\\gamma_{1}-\\tau_{1}} \\ldots p_{k}^{\\gamma_{i}-\\tau_{i}}$. Now, if $i \\in I^{\\prime \\prime}$, then for every $\\beta$ the condition $p_{i}^{\\left(\\gamma_{i}-\\tau_{i}\\right)-\\beta+1} \\mid q_{j}$ is equivalent to $p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}-\\beta+1} \\mid r_{j}$.\n\nNote that $n^{\\prime \\prime} \\leq n / d_{1}^{\\prime}<n$, hence we can apply the Claim to the covering $\\mathcal{Q}$. We perform this with the set of indices $I^{\\prime \\prime}$ and the exponents $\\beta_{i}^{\\prime \\prime}=\\min \\left\\{\\beta_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right\\}>0$. So, the set under consideration is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nT^{\\prime \\prime} & =\\left\\{j: Q_{j} \\in \\mathcal{Q}, \\text { and } p_{i}^{\\left(\\gamma_{i}-\\tau_{i}\\right)-\\min \\left\\{\\beta_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right\\}+1} \\mid q_{j} \\text { for some } i \\in I^{\\prime \\prime}\\right\\} \\\\\n& =\\left\\{j: Q_{j} \\in \\mathcal{Q}, \\text { and } p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}-\\min \\left\\{\\beta_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right\\}+1} \\mid r_{j} \\text { for some } i \\in I^{\\prime \\prime}\\right\\},\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand we obtain $\\left|T^{\\prime \\prime}\\right| \\geq 1+G$. Finally, we claim that $T^{\\prime \\prime} \\subseteq T \\cap\\left(\\{1\\} \\cup\\left\\{s^{\\prime}+1, \\ldots, s\\right\\}\\right)$; then we will obtain $\\left|T \\cap\\left\\{s^{\\prime}+1, \\ldots, s\\right\\}\\right| \\geq G$, which is exactly what we need.\n\nTo prove this, consider any $j \\in T^{\\prime \\prime}$. Observe first that $\\alpha_{i}-\\min \\left\\{\\beta_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right\\}+1>\\alpha_{i}-\\sigma_{i} \\geq \\tau_{i}$, hence from $p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}-\\min \\left\\{\\beta_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right\\}+1} \\mid r_{j}=$ l.c.m. $\\left(d_{1}^{\\prime}, d_{j}\\right)$ we have $p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}-\\min \\left\\{\\beta_{i}, \\sigma_{i}\\right\\}+1} \\mid d_{j}$, which means that $j \\in T$. Next, the exponent of $p_{i}$ in $d_{j}$ is greater than that in $n^{\\prime}$, which means that $P_{j} \\notin \\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$. This may appear only if $j=1$ or $j>s^{\\prime}$, as desired.

*   **Parallel Lines:** $BC \parallel AE$.

*   **Theme:** Geometric relationships in a convex pentagon with parallelism, length sums, midpoints, circumcenters, and perpendicularity leading to an angle proportion.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Introduce Concrete Parameter & Demand Numerical Computation:** Remove the proof requirement. Instead, assign a challenging numerical value to $\angle ABC$ (e.g., $97^{\circ}$). Require computation of both $\angle CDE$ and $\angle BDA$ as specific numbers, then verify the relationship directly by calculating $2 \angle BDA$ and confirming it equals $\angle CDE$.
2.  **Add Constraint & Introduce New Point:** Add the constraint $AE = AB/2$, implying $BC = AE$ (from $AB = BC + AE$). Introduce a new point $P$ on $AE$ such that $AP = BC$, establishing $AP = PE = BC = AE/2$ and $AB = AP + PE$. This ties the existing length condition directly to the new constraint and adds minor construction complexity.
3.  **Increase Reasoning & Concretize Relationship:** The equality $AB = AP + PE$ becomes explicit, reinforcing the length sum under the new constraint. Computing $\angle BDA$ requires navigating the same geometric relationships as the original proof but now demands precise numerical determination.
4.  **Ensure Interconnection:** All new elements are tightly linked. The new constraint ($AE = AB/2$) implies $BC = AE$, is integrated into the existing $AB = BC + AE$ to yield $AB = AP + PE$, guides the definition of $P$, and forces specific geometric ratios. The assigned $\angle ABC$ initiates the numerical computation chain.

2.  **Parameterize Position of X:** Express point X's position on BC with a parameter \(t\) (e.g., \(BX = t \cdot BC\) with \(0 < t < 1\)) to control the configuration. This adds variables.

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
1. **Modify the specific \(n\)**: Increase complexity by using a larger numerical value with more prime factors, replacing \(n = 2010\) with \(n = 2025\) (since \(2025 = 3^4 \times 5^2\), introducing prime powers for higher difficulty).

3. **Shift from proof to computation**: Instead of proving a universal statement, require computing the number of pairs \((a, b)\) in the range that satisfy a key property—here, being \(n\)-good for \(n = 2025\). This leverages the necessity to handle prime power injectivity conditions computationally.

If $(a, b)$ is $2010-\\operatorname{good}$ then $(a, b)$ is 67 -good.\n\nProof. Assume that $P(m)=P(k)(\\bmod 67)$. Since 67 and 30 are coprime, there exist integers $m^{\\prime}$ and $k^{\\prime}$ such that $k^{\\prime} \\equiv k(\\bmod 67), k^{\\prime} \\equiv 0(\\bmod 30)$, and $m^{\\prime} \\equiv m(\\bmod 67), m^{\\prime} \\equiv 0$ $(\\bmod 30)$.

Therefore, $(a, b)$ is 67 -good.\n\nClaim 2. If $(a, b)$ is 67 -good then $67 \\mid a$.\n\nProof. Suppose that $67 \\nmid a$. Consider the sets $\\left\\{a t^{2}(\\bmod 67): 0 \\leq t \\leq 33\\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{-3 a s^{2}-b\\right.$ $\\bmod 67: 0 \\leq s \\leq 33\\}$. Since $a \\not \\equiv 0(\\bmod 67)$, each of these sets has 34 elements. Hence they have at least one element in common. If $a t^{2} \\equiv-3 a s^{2}-b(\\bmod 67)$ then for $m=t \\pm s, k=\\mp 2 s$ we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nP(m)-P(k)=a\\left(m^{3}-k^{3}\\right)+b(m-k) & =(m-k)\\left(a\\left(m^{2}+m k+k^{2}\\right)+b\\right) \\\\\n& =(t \\pm 3 s)\\left(a t^{2}+3 a s^{2}+b\\right) \\equiv 0 \\quad(\\bmod 67)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince $(a, b)$ is 67 -good, we must have $m \\equiv k(\\bmod 67)$ in both cases, that is, $t \\equiv 3 s(\\bmod 67)$ and $t \\equiv-3 s(\\bmod 67)$. This means $t \\equiv s \\equiv 0(\\bmod 67)$ and $b \\equiv-3 a s^{2}-a t^{2} \\equiv 0(\\bmod 67)$. But then $67 \\mid P(7)-P(2)=67 \\cdot 5 a+5 b$ and $67 / 17-2$, contradicting that $(a, b)$ is 67 -good.\n\nClaim 3. If $(a, b)$ is $2010-\\operatorname{good}$ then $(a, b)$ is $67^{i}-\\operatorname{good}$ all $i \\geq 1$.\n\nProof. By Claim 2 , we have $67 \\mid a$. If $67 \\mid b$, then $P(x) \\equiv P(0)(\\bmod 67)$ for all $x$, contradicting that $(a, b)$ is 67 -good. Hence, $67 /\\langle b$.\n\nSuppose that $67^{i} \\mid P(m)-P(k)=(m-k)\\left(a\\left(m^{2}+m k+k^{2}\\right)+b\\right)$. Since $67 \\mid a$ and $67 \\not \\nmid b$, the second factor $a\\left(m^{2}+m k+k^{2}\\right)+b$ is coprime to 67 and hence $67^{i} \\mid m-k$. Therefore, $(a, b)$ is $67^{i}$-good.']"

*   **Operation Type:** Proof of upper bound ($2^{n}$).

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Replace Proof with Computation:** Instead of proving the maximum possible *theoretical* colors, require computing the exact *number* of valid color configurations (colorings) that satisfy the condition while also maximizing color usage under new constraints.
2.  **Introduce Per-Cell Color Limits:** Add a constraint $k$ limiting the maximum distinct colors allowed in any *single* cell: each cell can contain at most $\min(3, k)$ distinct colors, making equivalence class color assignment non-trivial and dependent on synergistic choices across the grid. Higher $k$ allows more colorings but adds counting complexity. Set $k = n + 1$ or similar.
3.  **Require Explicit Values:** Demarcate specific outputs: the theoretical maximum number of distinct colors (or a proof it's $2^n$), the count of valid colorings (maximizing distinct colors under cell limits), and a specific large-n evaluation.
4.  **Concretize & Avoid Trivial Cases:** Set $n \geq 2$ to ensure non-trivial size. Target the computation specifically for $n \geq 2$.
5.  **Symmetry Depth:** Require considering all pairs simultaneously when optimizing color classes, leveraging the equivalence relation structure implied by the core condition to define color classes before assignment subject to cell limits.
6.  **Interconnect:** The cell limit $k$ applies *after* defining equivalence classes from the symmetry. Coloring involves assigning *distinct* colors to different equivalence classes, but each cell belongs to one class and can only hold up to $\min(3, k)$ distinct colors (forcing careful assignment if $k< |classes|$), while still maximizing the total distinct colors used across the grid within this constraint. The equivalence relation computation is implicit in the requirement to satisfy the core condition.

Find the maximal possible number of distinct colors.

On the other hand, if each cycle has its own color, the obtained coloring obviously satisfies the problem conditions. Thus, the maximal possible number of colors is the same as the number of cycles, and we have to prove that this number is $2^{n}$.\n\nNext, consider any cycle $\\left(i_{1}, j_{1}\\right),\\left(i_{2}, j_{2}\\right), \\ldots$; we will describe it in other terms. Define a sequence $\\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots\\right)$ by the relations $a_{0}=i_{1}, a_{1}=j_{1}, a_{n+1}=a_{n}+a_{n-1}$ for all $n \\geq 1$ (we say that such a sequence is a Fibonacci-type sequence).

But then we have $F_{\\ell}=F_{k-1} F_{\\ell-k}+F_{k} F_{\\ell-k+1}$, where the second summand is divisible by $2^{m-1}$ but the first one is not (since $F_{k-1}$ is odd and $\\ell-k<k)$. Hence the sum is not divisible even by $2^{m-1}$. A contradiction.\n\nNow, for every pair of integers $(a, b) \\neq(0,0)$, let $\\mu(a, b)=\\min \\{\\nu(a), \\nu(b)\\}$.

Also denote by $p_{n}(A)$ the period of this sequence modulo $2^{n}$, that is, the least $p>0$ such that $a_{k+p} \\equiv a_{k}\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)$ for all $k \\geq 0$.\n\nLemma 3. Let $A=\\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots\\right)$ be a Fibonacci-type sequence such that $\\mu(A)=k<n$. Then $p_{n}(A)=3 \\cdot 2^{n-1-k}$.\n\nProof. First, we note that the sequence $\\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots\\right)$ has period $p$ modulo $2^{n}$ if and only if the sequence $\\left(a_{0} / 2^{k}, a_{1} / 2^{k}, \\ldots\\right)$ has period $p$ modulo $2^{n-k}$. Hence, passing to this sequence we can assume that $k=0$\n\nWe prove the statement by induction on $n$. It is easy to see that for $n=1,2$ the claim is true; actually, each Fibonacci-type sequence $A$ with $\\mu(A)=0$ behaves as $0,1,1,0,1,1, \\ldots$ modulo 2 , and as $0,1,1,2,3,1,0,1,1,2,3,1, \\ldots$ modulo 4 (all pairs of residues from which at least one is odd appear as a pair of consecutive terms in this sequence).\n\nNow suppose that $n \\geq 3$ and consider an arbitrary Fibonacci-type sequence $A=\\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots\\right)$ with $\\mu(A)=0$. Obviously we should have $p_{n-1}(A) \\mid p_{n}(A)$, or, using the induction hypothesis, $s=3 \\cdot 2^{n-2} \\mid p_{n}(A)$. Next, we may suppose that $a_{0}$ is even; hence $a_{1}$ is odd, and $a_{0}=2 b_{0}$, $a_{1}=2 b_{1}+1$ for some integers $b_{0}, b_{1}$.\n\nConsider the Fibonacci-type sequence $B=\\left(b_{0}, b_{1}, \\ldots\\right)$ starting with $\\left(b_{0}, b_{1}\\right)$. Since $a_{0}=$ $2 b_{0}+F_{0}, a_{1}=2 b_{1}+F_{1}$, by an easy induction we get $a_{k}=2 b_{k}+F_{k}$ for all $k \\geq 0$. By the induction hypothesis, we have $p_{n-1}(B) \\mid s$, hence the sequence $\\left(2 b_{0}, 2 b_{1}, \\ldots\\right)$ is $s$-periodic modulo $2^{n}$. On the other hand, by Lemma 2 we have $F_{s+1} \\equiv 1+2^{n-1}\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right), F_{2 s} \\equiv 0$ $\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right), F_{2 s+1} \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)$, hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\na_{s+1}=2 b_{s+1}+F_{s+1} \\equiv 2 b_{1}+1+2^{n-1} \\not \\equiv 2 b_{1}+1=a_{1} \\quad\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right) \\\\\na_{2 s}=2 b_{2 s}+F_{2 s} \\equiv 2 b_{0}+0=a_{0} \\quad\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right) \\\\\na_{2 s+1}=2 b_{2 s+1}+F_{2 s+1} \\equiv 2 b_{1}+1=a_{1} \\quad\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right) .\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nThe first line means that $A$ is not s-periodic, while the other two provide that $a_{2 s} \\equiv a_{0}$, $a_{2 s+1} \\equiv a_{1}$ and hence $a_{2 s+t} \\equiv a_{t}$ for all $t \\geq 0$. Hence $s\\left|p_{n}(A)\\right| 2 s$ and $p_{n}(A) \\neq s$, which means that $p_{n}(A)=2 s$, as desired.\n\nFinally, Lemma 3 provides a straightforward method of counting the number of cycles. Actually, take any number $0 \\leq k \\leq n-1$ and consider all the cells $(i, j)$ with $\\mu(i, j)=k$. The total number of such cells is $2^{2(n-k)}-2^{2(n-k-1)}=3 \\cdot 2^{2 n-2 k-2}$. On the other hand, they are split into cycles, and by Lemma 3 the length of each cycle is $3 \\cdot 2^{n-1-k}$. Hence the number of cycles consisting of these cells is exactly $\\frac{3 \\cdot 2^{2 n-2 k-2}}{3 \\cdot 2^{n-1-k}}=2^{n-k-1}$. Finally, there is only one cell $(0,0)$ which is not mentioned in the previous computation, and it forms a separate cycle. So the total number of cycles is\n\n$$\n1+\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2^{n-1-k}=1+\\left(1+2+4+\\cdots+2^{n-1}\\right)=2^{n}\n$$']"

#Plan#:
1.  **Transform Proof to Computation:** Instead of proving existence, require computation of the **minimum and maximum** achievable values of the key linear form over a constrained set related to `$S$` for a fixed `$n$`, demanding a specific numerical output.
2.  **Introduce Complex Subset Restriction:** Restrict the index set `$J$` used to define `$S$` to exclude indices congruent to `$0$` modulo a fixed integer `$k>1$`, significantly complicating the combinatorial structure of allowable subset sums for `$(x, y)$`.
3.  **Embed Constants via Root & Scale:** Derive `$\alpha$` and `$\beta$` from the characteristic root of the sequence `$c_n$` (`$\phi$`, the golden ratio) and scale one constant to `$1$` for simplicity/specificity. Set `$\alpha = 1$`, `$\beta = \phi - 1$` (forcing them to be fixed irrationals based on the sequence). Define the linear form `$D_{(x,y)} = \alpha x + \beta y$`.
4.  **Target Large Computable Value:** Set the constraint and computation for `$n=100$`, forcing computational complexity due to the exponential growth of subset sums under the new index restriction.
5.  **Concrete Output:** Define `$D_{\text{min}}$` and `$D_{\text{max}}$` as the min and max values of `$D_{(x,y)}$` for pairs in the *restricted* `$S$` derived from subsets `$J \subseteq \{1, 2, ..., n\}$` avoiding indices divisible by `$k$`. Require these values for `$n=100$` and `$k=5$`.

For $x=y=0$ it suffices to choose the empty subset of $\\mathbb{N}$ as $J$, so let at least one of $x, y$ be nonzero. There exist representations of $\\psi x+y$ of the form\n\n$$\n\\psi x+y=\\psi^{i_{1}}+\\cdots+\\psi^{i_{k}}\n$$\n\nwhere $i_{1} \\leq \\cdots \\leq i_{k}$ is a sequence of nonnegative integers, not necessarily distinct. For instance, we can take $x$ summands $\\psi^{1}=\\psi$ and $y$ summands $\\psi^{0}=1$. Consider all such representations of minimum length $k$ and focus on the ones for which $i_{1}$ has the minimum possible value $j_{1}$. Among them, consider the representations where $i_{2}$ has the minimum possible value $j_{2}$. Upon choosing $j_{3}, \\ldots, j_{k}$ analogously, we obtain a sequence $j_{1} \\leq \\cdots \\leq j_{k}$ which clearly satisfies $\\psi x+y=\\sum_{r=1}^{k} \\psi^{j_{r}}$. To prove the lemma, it suffices to show that $j_{1}, \\ldots, j_{k}$ are pairwise distinct.\n\nSuppose on the contrary that $j_{r}=j_{r+1}$ for some $r=1, \\ldots, k-1$. Let us consider the case $j_{r} \\geq 2$ first. Observing that $2 \\psi^{2}=1+\\psi^{3}$, we replace $j_{r}$ and $j_{r+1}$ by $j_{r}-2$ and $j_{r}+1$, respectively. Since\n\n$$\n\\psi^{j_{r}}+\\psi^{j_{r+1}}=2 \\psi^{j_{r}}=\\psi^{j_{r}-2}\\left(1+\\psi^{3}\\right)=\\psi^{j_{r}-2}+\\psi^{j_{r}+1}\n$$\n\nthe new sequence also represents $\\psi x+y$ as needed, and the value of $i_{r}$ in it contradicts the minimum choice of $j_{r}$.\n\nLet $j_{r}=j_{r+1}=0$. Then the sum $\\psi x+y=\\sum_{r=1}^{k} \\psi^{j_{r}}$ contains at least two summands equal to $\\psi^{0}=1$. On the other hand $j_{s} \\neq 1$ for all $s$, because the equality $1+\\psi=\\psi^{2}$ implies that a representation of minimum length cannot contain consecutive $i_{r}$ 's. It follows that\n\n$$\n\\psi x+y=\\sum_{r=1}^{k} \\psi^{j_{r}}>2+\\psi^{3}+\\psi^{5}+\\psi^{7}+\\cdots=2-\\psi^{2}=\\varphi\n$$\n\ncontradicting the condition of the lemma.\n\nLet $j_{r}=j_{r+1}=1$; then $\\sum_{r=1}^{k} \\psi^{j_{r}}$ contains at least two summands equal to $\\psi^{1}=\\psi$. Like in the case $j_{r}=j_{r+1}=0$, we also infer that $j_{s} \\neq 0$ and $j_{s} \\neq 2$ for all $s$.

The conclusion follows.\n\nNow let the ordered pair $(x, y)$ satisfy $-1<\\psi x+y<\\varphi$; hence the lemma applies to $(x, y)$. Let $J \\subset \\mathbb{N}$ be such that (2) holds. Comparing (1) and (2), we conclude that $\\psi x+y=\\psi a_{J}+b_{J}$. Now, $x, y, a_{J}$ and $b_{J}$ are integers, and $\\psi$ is irrational. So the last equality implies $x=a_{J}$ and $y=b_{J}$.

- **Update rule**: Simultaneous state change per second based on neighbors.

#Plan#:
1. **Introduce a specific challenging parameter**: Set \(n = 2^{20} - 1\) (a large fixed \(n = 1048575\)) instead of general \(n\), ensuring it’s one of the values known to reach all-off (as \(n+1 = 2^{20}\) is a power of 2).
2. **Alter the goal**: Instead of proving existence for infinitely many \(n\), requiring a precise numerical computation—first occurrence time \(T\) when all lamps are off—which demands simulating complex state transitions or deriving a closed form for large \(n\).
3. **Add a second computational metric**: Request the total number of lamp state changes until all-off is reached, counting every on/off toggle of each lamp over time, cumulatively. This blends counting with dynamics, doubling the computational depth.

This is indeed the case, and more precisely: let $A_{k}$ be the $2^{k} \\times 2^{k}$ matrix whose rows represent the evolution of the system, with entries 0,1 (for off and on respectively). The top row shows the initial state $[1,0,0, \\ldots, 0]$; the bottom row shows the state after $2^{k}-1$ steps. The claim is that:\n\n$$\n\\text { The bottom row of } A_{k} \\text { is }[1,1,1, \\ldots, 1] \\text {. }\n$$\n\nThis will of course suffice because one more move then produces $[0,0,0, \\ldots, 0]$, as required.\n\nThe proof is by induction on $k$. The base $k=1$ is obvious. Assume the claim to be true for a\n\n$k \\geq 1$ and write the matrix $A_{k+1}$ in the block form $\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}A_{k} & O_{k} \\\\ B_{k} & C_{k}\\end{array}\\right)$ with four $2^{k} \\times 2^{k}$ matrices. After $m$ steps, the last 1 in a row is at position $m+1$. Therefore $O_{k}$ is the zero matrix. According to the induction hypothesis, the bottom row of $\\left[A_{k} O_{k}\\right]$ is $[1, \\ldots, 1,0, \\ldots, 0]$, with $2^{k}$ ones and $2^{k}$ zeros.

Thus $B_{k}$ is the mirror image of $C_{k}$. In particular, the rightmost column of $B_{k}$ is identical with the leftmost column of $C_{k}$.\n\nImagine the matrix $C_{k}$ in isolation from the rest of $A_{k+1}$. Suppose it is subject to evolution as defined in the problem: the first (leftmost) term in a row depends only on the two first terms in the preceding row, according as they are equal or not. Now embed $C_{k}$ again in $A_{k}$. The 'leftmost' terms in the rows of $C_{k}$ now have neighbours on their left side - but these neighbours are their exact copies. Consequently the actual evolution within $C_{k}$ is the same, whether or not $C_{k}$ is considered as a piece of $A_{k+1}$ or in isolation. And since the top row of $C_{k}$ is $[1,0, \\ldots, 0]$, it follows that $C_{k}$ is identical with $A_{k}$.\n\n\n\nThe bottom row of $A_{k}$ is $[1,1, \\ldots, 1]$; the same is the bottom row of $C_{k}$, hence also of $B_{k}$, which mirrors $C_{k}$.

2. **Introduce time dependency**: Query the state of a specific lamp (e.g., the middle lamp \(L_{528}\)) after a large number of steps (e.g., \(t = 10^6\)) to necessitate cycle analysis or mathematical insight, preventing brute-force simulation.

2. **Introduce computational output:** Require counting the number of distinct $(n,k)$-tournaments after fixing players and constraints, increasing complexity through explicit enumeration.

We show that an $(n, k)$-tournament exists if and only if $2^{t_{k}}$ divides $n$.\n\nFirst we prove that if $n=2^{t}$ for some $t$ then there is an $(n, k)$-tournament for all $k \\leq 2^{t}-1$. Let $S$ be the set of $0-1$ sequences with length $t$. We label the $2^{t}$ players with the elements of $S$ in an arbitrary fashion (which is possible as there are exactly $2^{t}$ sequences in $S$ ). Players are identified with their labels in the construction below. If $\\alpha, \\beta \\in S$, let $\\alpha+\\beta \\in S$ be the result of the modulo 2 term-by-term addition of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ (with rules $0+0=0,0+1=1+0=1$, $1+1=0$; there is no carryover). For each $i=1, \\ldots, 2^{t}-1$ let $\\omega(i) \\in S$ be the sequence of base 2 digits of $i$, completed with leading zeros if necessary to achieve length $t$.\n\nNow define a tournament with $n=2^{t}$ players in $k \\leq 2^{t}-1$ rounds as follows: For all $i=1, \\ldots, k$, let player $\\alpha$ meet player $\\alpha+\\omega(i)$ in round $i$. The tournament is well-defined as $\\alpha+\\omega(i) \\in S$ and $\\alpha+\\omega(i)=\\beta+\\omega(i)$ implies $\\alpha=\\beta$; also $[\\alpha+\\omega(i)]+\\omega(i)=\\alpha$ for each $\\alpha \\in S$ (meaning that player $\\alpha+\\omega(i)$ meets player $\\alpha$ in round $i$, as needed). Each player plays in each round. Next, every two players meet at most once (exactly once if $k=2^{t}-1$ ), since $\\omega(i) \\neq \\omega(j)$ if $i \\neq j$. Thus condition (i) holds true, and condition (ii) is also easy to check.\n\nLet player $\\alpha$ meet player $\\beta$ in round $i$, player $\\gamma$ meet player $\\delta$ in round $i$, and player $\\alpha$ meet player $\\gamma$ in round $j$. Then $\\beta=\\alpha+\\omega(i), \\delta=\\gamma+\\omega(i)$ and $\\gamma=\\alpha+\\omega(j)$. By definition, $\\beta$ will play in round $j$ with\n\n$$\n\\beta+\\omega(j)=[\\alpha+\\omega(i)]+\\omega(j)=[\\alpha+\\omega(j)]+\\omega(i)=\\gamma+\\omega(i)=\\delta\n$$\n\nas required by (ii).\n\nSo there exists an $(n, k)$-tournament for pairs $(n, k)$ such that $n=2^{t}$ and $k \\leq 2^{t}-1$. The same conclusion is straightforward for $n$ of the form $n=2^{t} s$ and $k \\leq 2^{t}-1$. Indeed, consider $s$ different $\\left(2^{t}, k\\right)$-tournaments $T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{s}$, no two of them having players in common. Their union can be regarded as a $\\left(2^{t} s, k\\right)$-tournament $T$ where each round is the union of the respective rounds in $T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{s}$.\n\nIn summary, the condition that $2^{t_{k}}$ divides $n$ is sufficient for an $(n, k)$-tournament to exist. We prove that it is also necessary.\n\nConsider an arbitrary $(n, k)$-tournament. Represent each player by a point and after each round, join by an edge every two players who played in this round. Thus to a round $i=1, \\ldots, k$ there corresponds a graph $G_{i}$. We say that player $Q$ is an $i$-neighbour of player $P$ if there is a path of edges in $G_{i}$ from $P$ to $Q$; in other words, if there are players $P=X_{1}, X_{2}, \\ldots, X_{m}=Q$ such that player $X_{j}$ meets player $X_{j+1}$ in one of the first $i$ rounds, $j=1,2 \\ldots, m-1$. The set of $i$-neighbours of a player will be called its $i$-component. Clearly two $i$-components are either disjoint or coincide.\n\nHence after each round $i$ the set of players is partitioned into pairwise disjoint $i$-components. So, to achieve our goal, it suffices to show that all $k$-components have size divisible by $2^{t_{k}}$.\n\nTo this end, let us see how the $i$-component $\\Gamma$ of a player $A$ changes after round $i+1$. Suppose that $A$ meets player $B$ with $i$-component $\\Delta$ in round $i+1$ (components $\\Gamma$ and $\\Delta$ are\n\n\n\nnot necessarily distinct). We claim that then in round $i+1$ each player from $\\Gamma$ meets a player from $\\Delta$, and vice versa.\n\nIndeed, let $C$ be any player in $\\Gamma$, and let $C$ meet $D$ in round $i+1$. Since $C$ is an $i$-neighbour of $A$, there is a sequence of players $A=X_{1}, X_{2}, \\ldots, X_{m}=C$ such that $X_{j}$ meets $X_{j+1}$ in one of the first $i$ rounds, $j=1,2 \\ldots, m-1$. Let $X_{j}$ meet $Y_{j}$ in round $i+1$, for $j=1,2 \\ldots, m$; in particular $Y_{1}=B$ and $Y_{m}=D$. Players $Y_{j}$ exists in view of condition (i). Suppose that $X_{j}$ and $X_{j+1}$ met in round $r$, where $r \\leq i$. Then condition (ii) implies that and $Y_{j}$ and $Y_{j+1}$ met in round $r$, too. Hence $B=Y_{1}, Y_{2}, \\ldots, Y_{m}=D$ is a path in $G_{i}$ from $B$ to $D$. This is to say, $D$ is in the $i$-component $\\Delta$ of $B$, as claimed. By symmetry, each player from $\\Delta$ meets a player from $\\Gamma$ in round $i+1$. It follows in particular that $\\Gamma$ and $\\Delta$ have the same cardinality.\n\nIt is straightforward now that the $(i+1)$-component of $A$ is $\\Gamma \\cup \\Delta$, the union of two sets with the same size. Since $\\Gamma$ and $\\Delta$ are either disjoint or coincide, we have either $|\\Gamma \\cup \\Delta|=2|\\Gamma|$ or $|\\Gamma \\cup \\Delta|=|\\Gamma|$; as usual, $|\\cdots|$ denotes the cardinality of a finite set.\n\nLet $\\Gamma_{1}, \\ldots, \\Gamma_{k}$ be the consecutive components of a given player $A$. We obtained that either $\\left|\\Gamma_{i+1}\\right|=2\\left|\\Gamma_{i}\\right|$ or $\\left|\\Gamma_{i+1}\\right|=\\left|\\Gamma_{i}\\right|$ for $i=1, \\ldots, k-1$. Because $\\left|\\Gamma_{1}\\right|=2$, each $\\left|\\Gamma_{i}\\right|$ is a power of 2 , $i=1, \\ldots, k-1$. In particular $\\left|\\Gamma_{k}\\right|=2^{u}$ for some $u$.\n\nOn the other hand, player $A$ has played with $k$ different opponents by (i). All of them belong to $\\Gamma_{k}$, therefore $\\left|\\Gamma_{k}\\right| \\geq k+1$.\n\nThus $2^{u} \\geq k+1$, and since $t_{k}$ is the least integer satisfying $2^{t_{k}} \\geq k+1$, we conclude that $u \\geq t_{k}$. So the size of each $k$-component is divisible by $2^{t_{k}}$, which completes the argument.']"

We say simply ""triangle"" instead of ""upward equilateral triangle"" and ""size"" instead of ""side length.""\n\nThe necessity will be proven first. Assume that a holey triangle $T$ can be tiled with diamonds and consider such a tiling. Let $T^{\\prime}$ be a triangle of size $k$ in $T$ containing $h$ holes. Focus on the diamonds which cover (one or two) cells in $T^{\\prime}$. Let them form a figure $R$. The boundary of $T^{\\prime}$ consists of upward cells, so $R$ is a triangle of size $k$ with $h$ upward holes cut out and possibly some downward cells sticking out. Hence there are exactly $\\left(k^{2}+k\\right) / 2-h$ upward cells in $R$, and at least $\\left(k^{2}-k\\right) / 2$ downward cells (not counting those sticking out). On the other hand each diamond covers one upward and one downward cell, which implies $\\left(k^{2}+k\\right) / 2-h \\geq\\left(k^{2}-k\\right) / 2$. It follows that $h \\leq k$, as needed.\n\nWe pass on to the sufficiency. For brevity, let us say that a set of holes in a given triangle $T$ is spread out if every triangle of size $k$ in $T$ contains at most $k$ holes. For any set $S$ of spread out holes, a triangle of size $k$ will be called full of $S$ if it contains exactly $k$ holes of $S$. The proof is based on the following observation.\n\nLemma. Let $S$ be a set of spread out holes in $T$. Suppose that two triangles $T^{\\prime}$ and $T^{\\prime \\prime}$ are full of $S$, and that they touch or intersect. Let $T^{\\prime}+T^{\\prime \\prime}$ denote the smallest triangle in $T$ containing them. Then $T^{\\prime}+T^{\\prime \\prime}$ is also full of $S$.\n\nProof. Let triangles $T^{\\prime}, T^{\\prime \\prime}, T^{\\prime} \\cap T^{\\prime \\prime}$ and $T^{\\prime}+T^{\\prime \\prime}$ have sizes $a, b, c$ and $d$, and let them contain $a, b, x$ and $y$ holes of $S$, respectively. (Note that $T^{\\prime} \\cap T^{\\prime \\prime}$ could be a point, in which case $c=0$.) Since $S$ is spread out, we have $x \\leq c$ and $y \\leq d$. The geometric configuration of triangles clearly satisfies $a+b=c+d$. Furthermore, $a+b \\leq x+y$, since $a+b$ counts twice the holes in $T^{\\prime} \\cap T^{\\prime \\prime}$. These conclusions imply $x=c$ and $y=d$, as we wished to show.\n\nNow let $T_{n}$ be a holey triangle of size $n$, and let the set $H$ of its holes be spread out. We show by induction on $n$ that $T_{n}$ can be tiled with diamonds. The base $n=1$ is trivial. Suppose that $n \\geq 2$ and that the claim holds for holey triangles of size less than $n$.\n\nDenote by $B$ the bottom row of $T_{n}$ and by $T^{\\prime}$ the triangle formed by its top $n-1$ rows. There is at least one hole in $B$ as $T^{\\prime}$ contains at most $n-1$ holes. If this hole is only one, there is a unique way to tile $B$ with diamonds. Also, $T^{\\prime}$ contains exactly $n-1$ holes, making it a holey triangle of size $n-1$, and these holes are spread out. Hence it remains to apply the induction hypothesis.\n\nSo suppose that there are $m \\geq 2$ holes in $B$ and label them $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{m}$ from left to right. Let $\\ell$ be the line separating $B$ from $T^{\\prime}$. For each $i=1, \\ldots, m-1$, pick an upward cell $b_{i}$ between $a_{i}$ and $a_{i+1}$, with base on $\\ell$. Place a diamond to cover $b_{i}$ and its lower neighbour, a downward cell in $B$. The remaining part of $B$ can be tiled uniquely with diamonds. Remove from $T_{n}$ row $B$ and the cells $b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{m-1}$ to obtain a holey triangle $T_{n-1}$ of size $n-1$. The conclusion will follow by induction if the choice of $b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{m-1}$ guarantees that the following condition is satisfied: If the holes $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{m-1}$ are replaced by $b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{m-1}$ then the new set of holes is spread out again.\n\nWe show that such a choice is possible. The cells $b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{m-1}$ can be defined one at a time in this order, making sure that the above condition holds at each step. Thus it suffices to prove that there is an appropriate choice for $b_{1}$, and we set $a_{1}=u, a_{2}=v$ for clarity.\n\n\n\nLet $\\Delta$ be the triangle of maximum size which is full of $H$, contains the top vertex of the hole $u$, and has base on line $\\ell$. Call $\\Delta$ the associate of $u$. Observe that $\\Delta$ does not touch $v$. Indeed, if $\\Delta$ has size $r$ then it contains $r$ holes of $T_{n}$. Extending its slanted sides downwards produces a triangle $\\Delta^{\\prime}$ of size $r+1$ containing at least one more hole, namely $u$. Since there are at most $r+1$ holes in $\\Delta^{\\prime}$, it cannot contain $v$. Consequently, $\\Delta$ does not contain the top vertex of $v$.\n\nLet $w$ be the upward cell with base on $\\ell$ which is to the right of $\\Delta$ and shares a common vertex with it. The observation above shows that $w$ is to the left of $v$. Note that $w$ is not a hole, or else $\\Delta$ could be extended to a larger triangle full of $H$.\n\nWe prove that if the hole $u$ is replaced by $w$ then the new set of holes is spread out again. To verify this, we only need to check that if a triangle $\\Gamma$ in $T_{n}$ contains $w$ but not $u$ then $\\Gamma$ is not full of $H$. Suppose to the contrary that $\\Gamma$ is full of $H$. Consider the minimum triangle $\\Gamma+\\Delta$ containing $\\Gamma$ and the associate $\\Delta$ of $u$. Clearly $\\Gamma+\\Delta$ is larger than $\\Delta$, because $\\Gamma$ contains $w$ but $\\Delta$ does not. Next, $\\Gamma+\\Delta$ is full of $H \\backslash\\{u\\}$ by the lemma, since $\\Gamma$ and $\\Delta$ have a common point and neither of them contains $u$.\n\n<img_3190>\n\nIf $\\Gamma$ is above line $\\ell$ then so is $\\Gamma+\\Delta$, which contradicts the maximum choice of $\\Delta$. If $\\Gamma$ contains cells from row $B$, observe that $\\Gamma+\\Delta$ contains $u$. Let $s$ be the size of $\\Gamma+\\Delta$. Being full of $H \\backslash\\{u\\}, \\Gamma+\\Delta$ contains $s$ holes other than $u$. But it also contains $u$, contradicting the assumption that $H$ is spread out.\n\nThe claim follows, showing that $b_{1}=w$ is an appropriate choice for $a_{1}=u$ and $a_{2}=v$. As explained above, this is enough to complete the induction.']"

**#Elements Identified#:**
- **Polyhedron Properties**: Convex, without parallel edges, and without an edge parallel to any face except the two adjacent faces. The polyhedron is the core object, and its generality can be restricted to increase complexity.
- **Antipodal Pairs**: Defined for any two points (vertices, edge midpoints, etc.) where parallel planes pass through these points and contain the polyhedron between them. The definition can be extended to include additional point types (e.g., face centroids) to add layers.
- **Variables**: 
  - \(A\): Number of antipodal vertex pairs.
  - \(B\): Number of antipodal edge midpoint pairs.
- **Output**: The difference \(A - B\) expressed in terms of vertices (\(V\)), edges (\(E\)), and faces (\(F\)) counts. This can be transformed from a formula-based output to a specific numerical computation for a complex instance, ensuring computational difficulty by imposing concrete parameters.
- **Theme**: The problem involves combinatorial geometry on convex polyhedra, specifically counting critical points under parallel supporting plane conditions. Complexity can be increased by specifying a high-complexity polyhedron, adding point types, and demanding numerical computation over symbolic derivation.

### Step 2
**#Plan#:**
1. **Increase Polyhedron Complexity**: Replace the general polyhedron with a specific, highly symmetric polyhedron with numerous elements to make manual computation laborious. Choose the truncated icosahedron (known for its use in soccer balls), which has 60 vertices, 90 edges, and 32 faces (12 pentagons and 20 hexagons). It naturally satisfies the no-parallel conditions due to its symmetry and non-degeneracy.
2. **Extend Antipodal Definition**: Add a new point type (face centroids) for antipodal pairs, denoted as \(C\) (number of antipodal pairs of face centroids). This introduces additional counting variables and requires handling mixed point types, increasing combinatorial workload.
3. **Demand Detailed Numerical Output**: Instead of a symbolic difference \(A - B\), require the computation of numerical values for \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and their combined expression \(A - B + C\) for the specific polyhedron. This shift to numerical output forces explicit enumeration or algorithmic reasoning without relying on general formulas, leveraging the high element counts for complexity.
4. **Ensure Cohesion**: The truncated icosahedron's properties maintain the original constraints logically. Adding face centroids ties into the polyhedron's face geometry without introducing qualitative ambiguity. The computation of \(A - B + C\) is chosen as it likely simplifies to a known constant (like the Euler characteristic), but this is not stated to avoid simplification, demanding full computation.

Arc $S^{+}\\left(E_{j}\\right)$ is perpendicular to edge $E_{j}$ and it connects points $S^{+}\\left(F_{i_{1}}\\right)$ and $S^{+}\\left(F_{i_{2}}\\right)$.\n\nDefine also the set of inward normal vectors $S^{-}\\left(E_{i}\\right)$ which is the reflection of $S^{+}\\left(E_{i}\\right)$ across the origin.\n\nFor a vertex $V_{k}$, which is the common endpoint of edges $E_{j_{1}}, \\ldots, E_{j_{h}}$ and shared by faces $F_{i_{1}}, \\ldots, F_{i_{h}}$, take all support planes of $\\Gamma$ through point $V_{k}$ and let $S^{+}\\left(V_{k}\\right)$ be the set of their outward normal vectors. This is a region on $S$, a spherical polygon with vertices $S^{+}\\left(F_{i_{1}}\\right), \\ldots, S^{+}\\left(F_{i_{h}}\\right)$ bounded by $\\operatorname{arcs} S^{+}\\left(E_{j_{1}}\\right), \\ldots, S^{+}\\left(E_{j_{h}}\\right)$. Let $S^{-}\\left(V_{k}\\right)$ be the reflection of $S^{+}\\left(V_{k}\\right)$, the set of inward normal vectors.\n\nNote that region $S^{+}\\left(V_{k}\\right)$ is convex in the sense that it is the intersection of several half spheres.\n<img_3664>\n\nNow translate the conditions on $\\Gamma$ to the language of these objects.\n\n(a) Polyhedron $\\Gamma$ has no parallel edges - the great circles of $\\operatorname{arcs} S^{+}\\left(E_{i}\\right)$ and $S^{-}\\left(E_{j}\\right)$ are different for all $i \\neq j$.\n\n(b) If an edge $E_{i}$ does not belong to a face $F_{j}$ then they are not parallel - the great circle which contains $\\operatorname{arcs} S^{+}\\left(E_{i}\\right)$ and $S^{-}\\left(E_{i}\\right)$ does not pass through points $S^{+}\\left(F_{j}\\right)$ and $S^{-}\\left(F_{j}\\right)$.\n\n(c) Polyhedron $\\Gamma$ has no parallel faces - points $S^{+}\\left(F_{i}\\right)$ and $S^{-}\\left(F_{j}\\right)$ are pairwise distinct.\n\nThe regions $S^{+}\\left(V_{k}\\right)$, arcs $S^{+}\\left(E_{j}\\right)$ and points $S^{+}\\left(F_{i}\\right)$ provide a decomposition of the surface of the sphere. Regions $S^{-}\\left(V_{k}\\right)$, arcs $S^{-}\\left(E_{j}\\right)$ and points $S^{-}\\left(F_{i}\\right)$ provide the reflection of this decomposition. These decompositions are closely related to the problem.\n\n\n\nLemma 1. For any $1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$, regions $S^{-}\\left(V_{i}\\right)$ and $S^{+}\\left(V_{j}\\right)$ overlap if and only if vertices $V_{i}$ and $V_{j}$ are antipodal.\n\nLemma 2. For any $1 \\leq i, j \\leq m$, arcs $S^{-}\\left(E_{i}\\right)$ and $S^{+}\\left(E_{j}\\right)$ intersect if and only if the midpoints $Q_{i}$ and $Q_{j}$ of edges $E_{i}$ and $E_{j}$ are antipodal.\n\nProof of lemma 1. First note that by properties (a,b,c) above, the two regions cannot share only a single point or an arc. They are either disjoint or they overlap.\n\nAssume that the two regions have a common interior point $u$. Let $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ be two parallel support planes of $\\Gamma$ through points $V_{i}$ and $V_{j}$, respectively, with normal vector $u$. By the definition of regions $S^{-}\\left(V_{i}\\right)$ and $S^{+}\\left(V_{j}\\right), u$ is the inward normal vector of $P_{1}$ and the outward normal vector of $P_{2}$. Therefore polyhedron $\\Gamma$ lies between the two planes; vertices $V_{i}$ and $V_{j}$ are antipodal.\n\nTo prove the opposite direction, assume that $V_{i}$ and $V_{j}$ are antipodal. Then there exist two parallel support planes $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ through $V_{i}$ and $V_{j}$, respectively, such that $\\Gamma$ is between them. Let $u$ be the inward normal vector of $P_{1}$; then $u$ is the outward normal vector of $P_{2}$, therefore $u \\in S^{-}\\left(V_{i}\\right) \\cap S^{+}\\left(V_{j}\\right)$. The two regions have a common point, so they overlap.\n\nProof of lemma 2. Again, by properties (a,b) above, the endpoints of arc $S^{-}\\left(E_{i}\\right)$ cannot belong to $S^{+}\\left(E_{j}\\right)$ and vice versa. The two arcs are either disjoint or intersecting.\n\nAssume that arcs $S^{-}\\left(E_{i}\\right)$ and $S^{+}\\left(E_{j}\\right)$ intersect at point $u$. Let $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ be the two support planes through edges $E_{i}$ and $E_{j}$, respectively, with normal vector $u$. By the definition of $\\operatorname{arcs} S^{-}\\left(E_{i}\\right)$ and $S^{+}\\left(E_{j}\\right)$, vector $u$ points inwards from $P_{1}$ and outwards from $P_{2}$. Therefore $\\Gamma$ is between the planes. Since planes $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ pass through $Q_{i}$ and $Q_{j}$, these points are antipodal.\n\nFor the opposite direction, assume that points $Q_{i}$ and $Q_{j}$ are antipodal. Let $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ be two support planes through these points, respectively. An edge cannot intersect a support plane, therefore $E_{i}$ and $E_{j}$ lie in the planes $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$, respectively. Let $u$ be the inward normal vector of $P_{1}$, which is also the outward normal vector of $P_{2}$. Then $u \\in S^{-}\\left(E_{i}\\right) \\cap S^{+}\\left(E_{j}\\right)$. So the two arcs are not disjoint; they therefore intersect.\n\nNow create a new decomposition of sphere $S$. Draw all $\\operatorname{arcs} S^{+}\\left(E_{i}\\right)$ and $S^{-}\\left(E_{j}\\right)$ on sphere $S$ and put a knot at each point where two arcs meet. We have $\\ell$ knots at points $S^{+}\\left(F_{i}\\right)$ and another $\\ell$ knots at points $S^{-}\\left(F_{i}\\right)$, corresponding to the faces of $\\Gamma$; by property (c) they are different. We also have some pairs $1 \\leq i, j \\leq m$ where $\\operatorname{arcs} S^{-}\\left(E_{i}\\right)$ and $S^{+}\\left(E_{j}\\right)$ intersect. By Lemma 2, each antipodal pair $\\left(Q_{i}, Q_{j}\\right)$ gives rise to two such intersections; hence, the number of all intersections is $2 B$ and we have $2 \\ell+2 B$ knots in all.\n\nEach intersection knot splits two arcs, increasing the number of arcs by 2 . Since we started with $2 m$ arcs, corresponding the edges of $\\Gamma$, the number of the resulting curve segments is $2 m+4 B$.\n\nThe network of these curve segments divides the sphere into some ""new"" regions. Each new region is the intersection of some overlapping sets $S^{-}\\left(V_{i}\\right)$ and $S^{+}\\left(V_{j}\\right)$. Due to the convexity, the intersection of two overlapping regions is convex and thus contiguous. By Lemma 1, each pair of overlapping regions corresponds to an antipodal vertex pair and each antipodal vertex pair gives rise to two different overlaps, which are symmetric with respect to the origin. So the number of new regions is $2 A$.\n\nThe result now follows from Euler\'s polyhedron theorem. We have $n+l=m+2$ and\n\n$$\n(2 \\ell+2 B)+2 A=(2 m+4 B)+2,\n$$\n\ntherefore\n\n$$\nA-B=m-\\ell+1=n-1 \\text {. }\n$$\n\nTherefore $A-B$ is by one less than the number of vertices of $\\Gamma$.'
 ""Use the same notations for the polyhedron and its vertices, edges and faces as in Solution 1. We regard points as vectors starting from the origin. Polyhedron $\\Gamma$ is regarded as a closed convex set, including its interior. In some cases the edges and faces of $\\Gamma$ are also regarded as sets of points. The symbol $\\partial$ denotes the boundary of the certain set; e.g. $\\partial \\Gamma$ is the surface of $\\Gamma$.\n\nLet $\\Delta=\\Gamma-\\Gamma=\\{U-V: U, V \\in \\Gamma\\}$ be the set of vectors between arbitrary points of $\\Gamma$. Then $\\Delta$, being the sum of two bounded convex sets, is also a bounded convex set and, by construction, it is also centrally symmetric with respect to the origin. We will prove that $\\Delta$ is also a polyhedron and express the numbers of its faces, edges and vertices in terms $n, m, \\ell, A$ and $B$.\n\nLemma 1. For points $U, V \\in \\Gamma$, point $W=U-V$ is a boundary point of $\\Delta$ if and only if $U$ and $V$ are antipodal. Moreover, for each boundary point $W \\in \\partial \\Delta$ there exists exactly one pair of points $U, V \\in \\Gamma$ such that $W=U-V$.\n\nProof. Assume first that $U$ and $V$ are antipodal points of $\\Gamma$. Let parallel support planes $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ pass through them such that $\\Gamma$ is in between. Consider plane $P=P_{1}-U=$ $P_{2}-V$. This plane separates the interiors of $\\Gamma-U$ and $\\Gamma-V$. After reflecting one of the sets, e.g. $\\Gamma-V$, the sets $\\Gamma-U$ and $-\\Gamma+V$ lie in the same half space bounded by $P$. Then $(\\Gamma-U)+(-\\Gamma+V)=\\Delta-W$ lies in that half space, so $0 \\in P$ is a boundary point of the set $\\Delta-W$. Translating by $W$ we obtain that $W$ is a boundary point of $\\Delta$.\n\nTo prove the opposite direction, let $W=U-V$ be a boundary point of $\\Delta$, and let $\\Psi=$ $(\\Gamma-U) \\cap(\\Gamma-V)$. We claim that $\\Psi=\\{0\\}$. Clearly $\\Psi$ is a bounded convex set and $0 \\in \\Psi$. For any two points $X, Y \\in \\Psi$, we have $U+X, V+Y \\in \\Gamma$ and $W+(X-Y)=(U+X)-(V+Y) \\in \\Delta$. Since $W$ is a boundary point of $\\Delta$, the vector $X-Y$ cannot have the same direction as $W$. This implies that the interior of $\\Psi$ is empty. Now suppose that $\\Psi$ contains a line segment $S$. Then $S+U$ and $S+V$ are subsets of some faces or edges of $\\Gamma$ and these faces/edges are parallel to $S$. In all cases, we find two faces, two edges, or a face and an edge which are parallel, contradicting the conditions of the problem. Therefore, $\\Psi=\\{0\\}$ indeed.\n\nSince $\\Psi=(\\Gamma-U) \\cap(\\Gamma-V)$ consists of a single point, the interiors of bodies $\\Gamma-U$ and $\\Gamma-V$ are disjoint and there exists a plane $P$ which separates them. Let $u$ be the normal vector of $P$ pointing into that half space bounded by $P$ which contains $\\Gamma-U$. Consider the planes $P+U$ and $P+V$; they are support planes of $\\Gamma$, passing through $U$ and $V$, respectively. From plane $P+U$, the vector $u$ points into that half space which contains $\\Gamma$. From plane $P+V$, vector $u$ points into the opposite half space containing $\\Gamma$. Therefore, we found two proper support through points $U$ and $V$ such that $\\Gamma$ is in between.\n\nFor the uniqueness part, assume that there exist points $U_{1}, V_{1} \\in \\Gamma$ such that $U_{1}-V_{1}=U-V$. The points $U_{1}-U$ and $V_{1}-V$ lie in the sets $\\Gamma-U$ and $\\Gamma-V$ separated by $P$. Since $U_{1}-U=V_{1}-V$, this can happen only if both are in $P$; but the only such point is 0 . Therefore, $U_{1}-V_{1}=U-V$ implies $U_{1}=U$ and $V_{1}=V$. The lemma is complete.\n\nLemma 2. Let $U$ and $V$ be two antipodal points and assume that plane $P$, passing through 0 , separates the interiors of $\\Gamma-U$ and $\\Gamma-V$. Let $\\Psi_{1}=(\\Gamma-U) \\cap P$ and $\\Psi_{2}=(\\Gamma-V) \\cap P$. Then $\\Delta \\cap(P+U-V)=\\Psi_{1}-\\Psi_{2}+U-V$.\n\nProof. The sets $\\Gamma-U$ and $-\\Gamma+V$ lie in the same closed half space bounded by $P$. Therefore, for any points $X \\in(\\Gamma-U)$ and $Y \\in(-\\Gamma+V)$, we have $X+Y \\in P$ if and only if $X, Y \\in P$. Then\n\n$(\\Delta-(U-V)) \\cap P=((\\Gamma-U)+(-\\Gamma+V)) \\cap P=((\\Gamma-U) \\cap P)+((-\\Gamma+V) \\cap P)=\\Psi_{1}-\\Psi_{2}$.\n\nNow a translation by $(U-V)$ completes the lemma.\n\n\n\nNow classify the boundary points $W=U-V$ of $\\Delta$, according to the types of points $U$ and $V$. In all cases we choose a plane $P$ through 0 which separates the interiors of $\\Gamma-U$ and $\\Gamma-V$. We will use the notation $\\Psi_{1}=(\\Gamma-U) \\cap P$ and $\\Psi_{2}=(\\Gamma-V) \\cap P$ as well.\n\nCase 1: Both $U$ and $V$ are vertices of $\\Gamma$. Bodies $\\Gamma-U$ and $\\Gamma-V$ have a common vertex which is 0 . Choose plane $P$ in such a way that $\\Psi_{1}=\\Psi_{2}=\\{0\\}$. Then Lemma 2 yields $\\Delta \\cap(P+W)=\\{W\\}$. Therefore $P+W$ is a support plane of $\\Delta$ such that they have only one common point so no line segment exists on $\\partial \\Delta$ which would contain $W$ in its interior.\n\nSince this case occurs for antipodal vertex pairs and each pair is counted twice, the number of such boundary points on $\\Delta$ is $2 A$.\n\nCase 2: Point $U$ is an interior point of an edge $E_{i}$ and $V$ is a vertex of $\\Gamma$. Choose plane $P$ such that $\\Psi_{1}=E_{i}-U$ and $\\Psi_{2}=\\{0\\}$. By Lemma $2, \\Delta \\cap(P+W)=E_{i}-V$. Hence there exists a line segment in $\\partial \\Delta$ which contains $W$ in its interior, but there is no planar region in $\\partial \\Delta$ with the same property.\n\nWe obtain a similar result if $V$ belongs to an edge of $\\Gamma$ and $U$ is a vertex.\n\nCase 3: Points $U$ and $V$ are interior points of edges $E_{i}$ and $E_{j}$, respectively. Let $P$ be the plane of $E_{i}-U$ and $E_{j}-V$. Then $\\Psi_{1}=E_{i}-U, \\Psi_{2}=E_{j}-V$ and $\\Delta \\cap(P+W)=E_{i}-E_{j}$. Therefore point $W$ belongs to a parallelogram face on $\\partial \\Delta$.\n\nThe centre of the parallelogram is $Q_{i}-Q_{j}$, the vector between the midpoints. Therefore an edge pair $\\left(E_{i}, E_{j}\\right)$ occurs if and only if $Q_{i}$ and $Q_{j}$ are antipodal which happens $2 B$ times.\n\nCase 4: Point $U$ lies in the interior of a face $F_{i}$ and $V$ is a vertex of $\\Gamma$. The only choice for $P$ is the plane of $F_{i}-U$. Then we have $\\Psi_{1}=F_{i}-U, \\Psi_{2}=\\{0\\}$ and $\\Delta \\cap(P+W)=F_{i}-V$. This is a planar face of $\\partial \\Delta$ which is congruent to $F_{i}$.\n\nFor each face $F_{i}$, the only possible vertex $V$ is the farthest one from the plane of $F_{i}$.\n\nIf $U$ is a vertex and $V$ belongs to face $F_{i}$ then we obtain the same way that $W$ belongs to a face $-F_{i}+U$ which is also congruent to $F_{i}$. Therefore, each face of $\\Gamma$ has two copies on $\\partial \\Delta$, a translated and a reflected copy.\n\nCase 5: Point $U$ belongs to a face $F_{i}$ of $\\Gamma$ and point $V$ belongs to an edge or a face $G$. In this case objects $F_{i}$ and $G$ must be parallel which is not allowed.\n<img_3967>\n\nNow all points in $\\partial \\Delta$ belong to some planar polygons (cases 3 and 4 ), finitely many line segments (case 2) and points (case 1). Therefore $\\Delta$ is indeed a polyhedron. Now compute the numbers of its vertices, edges and faces.\n\nThe vertices are obtained in case 1 , their number is $2 A$.\n\nFaces are obtained in cases 3 and 4 . Case 3 generates $2 B$ parallelogram faces. Case 4 generates $2 \\ell$ faces.\n\nWe compute the number of edges of $\\Delta$ from the degrees (number of sides) of faces of $\\Gamma$. Let $d_{i}$ be the the degree of face $F_{i}$. The sum of degrees is twice as much as the number of edges, so $d_{1}+d_{2}+\\ldots+d_{l}=2 m$. The sum of degrees of faces of $\\Delta$ is $2 B \\cdot 4+2\\left(d_{1}+d_{2}+\\cdots+d_{l}\\right)=8 B+4 m$, so the number of edges on $\\Delta$ is $4 B+2 m$.\n\nApplying Euler's polyhedron theorem on $\\Gamma$ and $\\Delta$, we have $n+l=m+2$ and $2 A+(2 B+2 \\ell)=$ $(4 B+2 m)+2$. Then the conclusion follows:\n\n$$\nA-B=m-\\ell+1=n-1 \\text {. }\n$$""]"

The lines $A O_{1}$, $B O_{2}$ and $C M=t$ are concurrent at the centre $Q$ of this homothety.\n\nFinally, apply Pappus' theorem to the triples of collinear points $A, O, B$ and $O_{2}, D, O_{1}$. The theorem implies that the points $A D \\cap O O_{2}=F, A O_{1} \\cap B O_{2}=Q$ and $O O_{1} \\cap B D=E$ are collinear.

#Elements Identified#:  
- Variables: Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\) forming a convex quadrilateral; circles through \(A\) and \(D\), and through \(B\) and \(C\); point \(P\) at external tangency inside the quadrilateral.  
- Conditions: \(\angle PAB + \angle PDC \leq 90^\circ\), \(\angle PBA + \angle PCD \leq 90^\circ\).  
- Theme: Geometric inequality involving side lengths, circle tangency, and angle constraints.  
- Participants/Process: Circles tangent at \(P\), angles at vertices, side length comparison.  
- Actions: Proof of \(AB + CD \geq BC + AD\) under given constraints.  

### Step 2  
#Plan#:  
- Add numerical specificity: Assign fixed lengths \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 4\), \(AD = 3\) to introduce asymmetry and require solution of unknown \(CD\).  
- Increase reasoning via concrete angles: Replace angle sum inequalities with fixed angle values to impose strict conditions, ensuring sums equal \(90^\circ\): set \(\angle PAB = 30^\circ\), \(\angle PDC = 60^\circ\), \(\angle PBA = 45^\circ\), \(\angle PCD = 45^\circ\). This forces equality in the sums, increasing calculation complexity.  
- Transform from proof to computation: Instead of proving inequality, compute a specific output—length of \(CD\)—under the above, adding real-world constraint of resolving circle tangency and vertex angles.  
- Modify outcome: Final answer is numerical (length \(CD\)), obtained via solving geometric relations involving circles, tangency, and trigonometric properties, ensuring logical interconnection.

Thus $\\angle A D T+\\angle B C T=\\angle A T Z+\\angle B T Z=\\angle A T B$.\n\nAnd conversely, if $\\angle A D T+\\angle B C T=\\angle A T B$ then one can draw from $T$ a ray $T Z$ with $Z$ on $A B$ so that $\\angle A D T=\\angle A T Z, \\angle B C T=\\angle B T Z$. The first of these equalities implies that $T Z$ is tangent to the circle $(D A T)$; by the second equality, $T Z$ is tangent to the circle $(B C T)$, so the two circles are tangent at $T$.\n\n<img_3708>\n\nSo the equivalence (1) is settled. It will be used later on. Now pass to the actual solution. Its key idea is to introduce the circumcircles of triangles $A B P$ and $C D P$ and to consider their second intersection $Q$ (assume for the moment that they indeed meet at two distinct points $P$ and $Q$ ).\n\nSince the point $A$ lies outside the circle $(B C P)$, we have $\\angle B C P+\\angle B A P<180^{\\circ}$. Therefore the point $C$ lies outside the circle $(A B P)$. Analogously, $D$ also lies outside that circle.

So their angles at $Q$ are obtuse. This implies that $Q$ lies not only inside the angle $B P C$ but in fact inside the triangle $B P C$, hence also inside the quadrilateral $A B C D$.\n\nNow an argument similar to that used in deriving (2) shows that\n\n$$\n\\angle B Q C=\\angle P A B+\\angle P D C \\leq 90^{\\circ} .\\tag{3}\n$$\n\nMoreover, since $\\angle P C Q=\\angle P D Q$, we get\n\n$$\n\\angle A D Q+\\angle B C Q=\\angle A D P+\\angle P D Q+\\angle B C P-\\angle P C Q=\\angle A D P+\\angle B C P .\n$$\n\nThe last sum is equal to $\\angle A P B$, according to the observation (1) applied to $T=P$.

(We have assumed $P \\neq Q$; but if $P=Q$ then the last conclusion holds trivially.)\n\nFinally consider the halfdiscs with diameters $B C$ and $D A$ constructed inwardly to the quadrilateral $A B C D$. They have centres at $M$ and $N$, the midpoints of $B C$ and $D A$ respectively. In view of (2) and (3), these two halfdiscs lie entirely inside the circles $(B Q C)$ and $(A Q D)$; and since these circles are tangent, the two halfdiscs cannot overlap. Hence $M N \\geq \\frac{1}{2} B C+\\frac{1}{2} D A$.\n\nOn the other hand, since $\\overrightarrow{M N}=\\frac{1}{2}(\\overrightarrow{B A}+\\overrightarrow{C D})$, we have $M N \\leq \\frac{1}{2}(A B+C D)$.

**#Elements Identified#:**  
- **Convex polygon**: The shape is explicitly convex, with sides defined by its vertices.  
- **Sides**: The polygon has multiple sides, each a line segment between consecutive vertices.  
- **Triangle area assignment**: For each side, compute the maximum area of a triangle contained in the polygon that shares that side.  
- **Summation**: The result involves summing these maximum areas over all sides.  
- **Comparison to twice polygon area**: The original instruction involves proving an inequality relating the sum to twice the polygon's area.  
- **Theme**: Geometry of convex sets, optimization (max area per side), algebraic computation of areas.  

### Step 2  
**#Plan#:**  
- **Modify variable (polygon specification)**: Replace the general convex polygon with a specific, computationally intensive instance: vertices defined by discrete exponential growth, e.g., \((k, 2^k)\) for \(k = 0\) to \(n\) with \(n = 10\), ensuring more vertices (10 sides) and irregular shape to increase calculation complexity.  
- **Change action from proof to computation and add constraint**: Instead of proving an inequality, require computation of a specific numerical value for the sum \(S\) after increasing the number of vertices. Add the constraint that vertices have integer coordinates to facilitate area computation but with large range (due to \(2^k\)), making distance and area calculations intricate.  
- **Increase reasoning difficulty**: Demand computation for a large \(n\) (10 vertices, 10 sides) to necessitate detailed geometric calculations for each side, including determining line equations, perpendicular distances, and max area via vertex distances for all possible vertices per side.  
- **Ensure interconnection**: Coordinates and large \(n\) directly tie to the area assignment computations; integer coordinates allow precise arithmetic but rapid growth amplifies complexity; the problem remains centered on areas and the sum from the original.  
- **Avoid simplification**: Using \(n=10\) is non-trivial (not a small case), and the exponential growth introduces numerical magnitude.

Every convex $(2 n)$-gon, of area $S$, has a side and a vertex that jointly span a triangle of area not less than $S / n$.\n\nProof. By main diagonals of the (2n)-gon we shall mean those which partition the (2n)-gon into two polygons with equally many sides. For any side $b$ of the $(2 n)$-gon denote by $\\Delta_{b}$ the triangle $A B P$ where $A, B$ are the endpoints of $b$ and $P$ is the intersection point of the main diagonals $A A^{\\prime}, B B^{\\prime}$. We claim that the union of triangles $\\Delta_{b}$, taken over all sides, covers the whole polygon.\n\nTo show this, choose any side $A B$ and consider the main diagonal $A A^{\\prime}$ as a directed segment. Let $X$ be any point in the polygon, not on any main diagonal. For definiteness, let $X$ lie on the left side of the ray $A A^{\\prime}$. Consider the sequence of main diagonals $A A^{\\prime}, B B^{\\prime}, C C^{\\prime}, \\ldots$, where $A, B, C, \\ldots$ are consecutive vertices, situated right to $A A^{\\prime}$.\n\nThe $n$-th item in this sequence is the diagonal $A^{\\prime} A$ (i.e. $A A^{\\prime}$ reversed), having $X$ on its right side. So there are two successive vertices $K, L$ in the sequence $A, B, C, \\ldots$ before $A^{\\prime}$ such that $X$ still lies to the left of $K K^{\\prime}$ but to the right of $L L^{\\prime}$. And this means that $X$ is in the triangle $\\Delta_{\\ell^{\\prime}}, \\ell^{\\prime}=K^{\\prime} L^{\\prime}$. Analogous reasoning applies to points $X$ on the right of $A A^{\\prime}$ (points lying on main diagonals can be safely ignored). Thus indeed the triangles $\\Delta_{b}$ jointly cover the whole polygon.\n\nThe sum of their areas is no less than $S$.

Attach the $2 n$ vectors $\\pm \\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i+1}}$ at a common origin and label them $\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{1}}, \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{2}}, \\ldots, \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{2 n}}$ in counterclockwise direction; the choice of the first vector $\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{1}}$ is irrelevant. The order of labelling is well-defined if $\\mathcal{P}$ has neither parallel sides nor angles equal to $180^{\\circ}$. Otherwise several collinear vectors with the same direction are labelled consecutively $\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}, \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j+1}}, \\ldots, \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j+r}}$. One can assume that in such cases the respective opposite vectors occur in the order $-\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}},-\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j+1}}, \\ldots,-\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j+r}}$, ensuring that $\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j+n}}=-\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}$ for $j=1, \\ldots, 2 n$. Indices are taken cyclically here and in similar situations below.\n\nChoose points $B_{1}, B_{2}, \\ldots, B_{2 n}$ satisfying $\\overrightarrow{B_{j} B_{j+1}}=\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}$ for $j=1, \\ldots, 2 n$. The polygonal line $\\mathcal{Q}=B_{1} B_{2} \\ldots B_{2 n}$ is closed, since $\\sum_{j=1}^{2 n} \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}=\\overrightarrow{0}$. Moreover, $\\mathcal{Q}$ is a convex $(2 n)$-gon due to the arrangement of the vectors $\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}$, possibly with $180^{\\circ}$-angles. The side vectors of $\\mathcal{Q}$ are $\\pm \\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i+1}}$, $1 \\leq i \\leq n$. So in particular $\\mathcal{Q}$ is centrally symmetric, because it contains as side vectors $\\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i+1}}$ and $-\\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i+1}}$ for each $i=1, \\ldots, n$. Note that $B_{j} B_{j+1}$ and $B_{j+n} B_{j+n+1}$ are opposite sides of $\\mathcal{Q}$, $1 \\leq j \\leq n$. We call $\\mathcal{Q}$ the associate of $\\mathcal{P}$.\n\nLet $S_{i}$ be the maximum area of a triangle with side $A_{i} A_{i+1}$ in $\\mathcal{P}, 1 \\leq i \\leq n$. We prove that\n\n$$\n\\left[B_{1} B_{2} \\ldots B_{2 n}\\right]=2 \\sum_{i=1}^{n} S_{i} \\tag{1}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\left[B_{1} B_{2} \\ldots B_{2 n}\\right] \\geq 4\\left[A_{1} A_{2} \\ldots A_{n}\\right] \\tag{2}\n$$\n\nIt is clear that (1) and (2) imply the conclusion of the original problem.\n\nLemma. For a side $A_{i} A_{i+1}$ of $\\mathcal{P}$, let $h_{i}$ be the maximum distance from a point of $\\mathcal{P}$ to line $A_{i} A_{i+1}$, $i=1, \\ldots, n$. Denote by $B_{j} B_{j+1}$ the side of $\\mathcal{Q}$ such that $\\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i+1}}=\\overrightarrow{B_{j} B_{j+1}}$. Then the distance between $B_{j} B_{j+1}$ and its opposite side in $\\mathcal{Q}$ is equal to $2 h_{i}$.\n\nProof. Choose a vertex $A_{k}$ of $\\mathcal{P}$ at distance $h_{i}$ from line $A_{i} A_{i+1}$. Let $\\mathbf{u}$ be the unit vector perpendicular to $A_{i} A_{i+1}$ and pointing inside $\\mathcal{P}$. Denoting by $\\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{y}$ the dot product of vectors $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$, we have\n\n$$\nh=\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{k}}=\\mathbf{u} \\cdot\\left(\\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i+1}}+\\cdots+\\overrightarrow{A_{k-1} A_{k}}\\right)=\\mathbf{u} \\cdot\\left(\\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i-1}}+\\cdots+\\overrightarrow{A_{k+1} A_{k}}\\right)\n$$\n\nIn $\\mathcal{Q}$, the distance $H_{i}$ between the opposite sides $B_{j} B_{j+1}$ and $B_{j+n} B_{j+n+1}$ is given by\n\n$$\nH_{i}=\\mathbf{u} \\cdot\\left(\\overrightarrow{B_{j} B_{j+1}}+\\cdots+\\overrightarrow{B_{j+n-1} B_{j+n}}\\right)=\\mathbf{u} \\cdot\\left(\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}+\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j+1}}+\\cdots+\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j+n-1}}\\right) .\n$$\n\nThe choice of vertex $A_{k}$ implies that the $n$ consecutive vectors $\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}, \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j+1}}, \\ldots, \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j+n-1}}$ are precisely $\\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i+1}}, \\ldots, \\overrightarrow{A_{k-1} A_{k}}$ and $\\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i-1}}, \\ldots, \\overrightarrow{A_{k+1} A_{k}}$, taken in some order. This implies $H_{i}=2 h_{i}$.\n\nFor a proof of (1), apply the lemma to each side of $\\mathcal{P}$. If $O$ the centre of $\\mathcal{Q}$ then, using the notation of the lemma,\n\n$$\n\\left[B_{j} B_{j+1} O\\right]=\\left[B_{j+n} B_{j+n+1} O\\right]=\\left[A_{i} A_{i+1} A_{k}\\right]=S_{i}\n$$\n\nSummation over all sides of $\\mathcal{P}$ yields (1).\n\nSet $d(\\mathcal{P})=[\\mathcal{Q}]-4[\\mathcal{P}]$ for a convex polygon $\\mathcal{P}$ with associate $\\mathcal{Q}$. Inequality $(2)$ means that $d(\\mathcal{P}) \\geq 0$ for each convex polygon $\\mathcal{P}$. The last inequality will be proved by induction on the\n\n\n\nnumber $\\ell$ of side directions of $\\mathcal{P}$, i. e. the number of pairwise nonparallel lines each containing a side of $\\mathcal{P}$.\n\nWe choose to start the induction with $\\ell=1$ as a base case, meaning that certain degenerate polygons are allowed. More exactly, we regard as degenerate convex polygons all closed polygonal lines of the form $X_{1} X_{2} \\ldots X_{k} Y_{1} Y_{2} \\ldots Y_{m} X_{1}$, where $X_{1}, X_{2}, \\ldots, X_{k}$ are points in this order on a line segment $X_{1} Y_{1}$, and so are $Y_{m}, Y_{m-1}, \\ldots, Y_{1}$. The initial construction applies to degenerate polygons; their associates are also degenerate, and the value of $d$ is zero. For the inductive step, consider a convex polygon $\\mathcal{P}$ which determines $\\ell$ side directions, assuming that $d(\\mathcal{P}) \\geq 0$ for polygons with smaller values of $\\ell$.\n\nSuppose first that $\\mathcal{P}$ has a pair of parallel sides, i. e. sides on distinct parallel lines. Let $A_{i} A_{i+1}$ and $A_{j} A_{j+1}$ be such a pair, and let $A_{i} A_{i+1} \\leq A_{j} A_{j+1}$. Remove from $\\mathcal{P}$ the parallelogram $R$ determined by vectors $\\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i+1}}$ and $\\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{j+1}}$. Two polygons are obtained in this way. Translating one of them by vector $\\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i+1}}$ yields a new convex polygon $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$, of area $[\\mathcal{P}]-[R]$ and with value of $\\ell$ not exceeding the one of $\\mathcal{P}$. The construction just described will be called operation A.\n<img_3326>\n\nThe associate of $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ is obtained from $\\mathcal{Q}$ upon decreasing the lengths of two opposite sides by an amount of $2 A_{i} A_{i+1}$. By the lemma, the distance between these opposite sides is twice the distance between $A_{i} A_{i+1}$ and $A_{j} A_{j+1}$. Thus operation $\\mathbf{A}$ decreases $[\\mathcal{Q}]$ by the area of a parallelogram with base and respective altitude twice the ones of $R$, i. e. by $4[R]$. Hence $\\mathbf{A}$ leaves the difference $d(\\mathcal{P})=[\\mathcal{Q}]-4[\\mathcal{P}]$ unchanged.\n\nNow, if $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ also has a pair of parallel sides, apply operation $\\mathbf{A}$ to it. Keep doing so with the subsequent polygons obtained for as long as possible. Now, A decreases the number $p$ of pairs of parallel sides in $\\mathcal{P}$. Hence its repeated applications gradually reduce $p$ to 0 , and further applications of $\\mathbf{A}$ will be impossible after several steps. For clarity, let us denote by $\\mathcal{P}$ again the polygon obtained at that stage.\n\nThe inductive step is complete if $\\mathcal{P}$ is degenerate. Otherwise $\\ell>1$ and $p=0$, i. e. there are no parallel sides in $\\mathcal{P}$. Observe that then $\\ell \\geq 3$. Indeed, $\\ell=2$ means that the vertices of $\\mathcal{P}$ all lie on the boundary of a parallelogram, implying $p>0$.\n\nFurthermore, since $\\mathcal{P}$ has no parallel sides, consecutive collinear vectors in the sequence $\\left(\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{k}}\\right)$ (if any) correspond to consecutive $180^{\\circ}$-angles in $\\mathcal{P}$. Removing the vertices of such angles, we obtain a convex polygon with the same value of $d(\\mathcal{P})$.\n\nIn summary, if operation $\\mathbf{A}$ is impossible for a nondegenerate polygon $\\mathcal{P}$, then $\\ell \\geq 3$. In addition, one may assume that $\\mathcal{P}$ has no angles of size $180^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe last two conditions then also hold for the associate $\\mathcal{Q}$ of $\\mathcal{P}$, and we perform the following construction. Since $\\ell \\geq 3$, there is a side $B_{j} B_{j+1}$ of $\\mathcal{Q}$ such that the sum of the angles at $B_{j}$ and $B_{j+1}$ is greater than $180^{\\circ}$. (Such a side exists in each convex $k$-gon for $k>4$.) Naturally, $B_{j+n} B_{j+n+1}$ is a side with the same property. Extend the pairs of sides $B_{j-1} B_{j}, B_{j+1} B_{j+2}$\n\n\n\nand $B_{j+n-1} B_{j+n}, B_{j+n+1} B_{j+n+2}$ to meet at $U$ and $V$, respectively. Let $\\mathcal{Q}^{\\prime}$ be the centrally symmetric convex 2(n+1)-gon obtained from $\\mathcal{Q}$ by inserting $U$ and $V$ into the sequence $B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{2 n}$ as new vertices between $B_{j}, B_{j+1}$ and $B_{j+n}, B_{j+n+1}$, respectively. Informally, we adjoin to $\\mathcal{Q}$ the congruent triangles $B_{j} B_{j+1} U$ and $B_{j+n} B_{j+n+1} V$. Note that $B_{j}, B_{j+1}, B_{j+n}$ and $B_{j+n+1}$ are kept as vertices of $\\mathcal{Q}^{\\prime}$, although $B_{j} B_{j+1}$ and $B_{j+n} B_{j+n+1}$ are no longer its sides.\n\nLet $A_{i} A_{i+1}$ be the side of $\\mathcal{P}$ such that $\\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i+1}}=\\overrightarrow{B_{j} B_{j+1}}=\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}$. Consider the point $W$ such that triangle $A_{i} A_{i+1} W$ is congruent to triangle $B_{j} B_{j+1} U$ and exterior to $\\mathcal{P}$. Insert $W$ into the sequence $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n}$ as a new vertex between $A_{i}$ and $A_{i+1}$ to obtain an $(n+1)$-gon $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$. We claim that $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ is convex and its associate is $\\mathcal{Q}^{\\prime}$.\n<img_3469>\n\nVectors $\\overrightarrow{A_{i} W}$ and $\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j-1}}$ are collinear and have the same direction, as well as vectors $\\overrightarrow{W A_{i+1}}$ and $\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j+1}}$. Since $\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j-1}}, \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}, \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j+1}}$ are consecutive terms in the sequence $\\left(\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{k}}\\right)$, the angle inequalities $\\angle\\left(\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j-1}}, \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}\\right) \\leq \\angle\\left(\\overrightarrow{A_{i-1} A_{i}}, \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}\\right)$ and $\\angle\\left(\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}, \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j+1}}\\right) \\leq \\angle\\left(\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}, \\overrightarrow{A_{i+1} A_{i+2}}\\right)$ hold true. They show that $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ is a convex polygon. To construct its associate, vectors $\\pm \\overrightarrow{A_{i} A_{i+1}}= \\pm \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j}}$ must be deleted from the defining sequence $\\left(\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{k}}\\right)$ of $\\mathcal{Q}$, and the vectors $\\pm \\overrightarrow{A_{i} W}, \\pm \\overrightarrow{W A_{i+1}}$ must be inserted appropriately into it. The latter can be done as follows:\n\n$$\n\\ldots, \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j-1}}, \\overrightarrow{A_{i} W}, \\overrightarrow{W A_{i+1}}, \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j+1}}, \\ldots,-\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j-1}},-\\overrightarrow{A_{i} W},-\\overrightarrow{W A_{i+1}},-\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{b}_{j+1}}, \\ldots\n$$\n\nThis updated sequence produces $\\mathcal{Q}^{\\prime}$ as the associate of $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$.\n\nIt follows from the construction that $\\left[\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}\\right]=[\\mathcal{P}]+\\left[A_{i} A_{i+1} W\\right]$ and $\\left[\\mathcal{Q}^{\\prime}\\right]=[\\mathcal{Q}]+2\\left[A_{i} A_{i+1} W\\right]$. Therefore $d\\left(\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}\\right)=d(\\mathcal{P})-2\\left[A_{i} A_{i+1} W\\right]<d(\\mathcal{P})$.\n\nTo finish the induction, it remains to notice that the value of $\\ell$ for $\\mathcal{P}^{\\prime}$ is less than the one for $\\mathcal{P}$. This is because side $A_{i} A_{i+1}$ was removed. The newly added sides $A_{i} W$ and $W A_{i+1}$ do not introduce new side directions. Each one of them is either parallel to a side of $\\mathcal{P}$ or lies on the line determined by such a side. The proof is complete.']"

In other words, every integer fixed point of $Q$ is a fixed point of the polynomial $P(P(x))$. Our task is to prove that there are at most $n$ such points.\n\nLet $a$ be one of them so that $b=P(a) \\neq a$ (we have assumed that such an $a$ exists); then $a=P(b)$. Take any other integer fixed point $\\alpha$ of $P(P(x))$ and let $P(\\alpha)=\\beta$, so that $P(\\beta)=\\alpha$; the numbers $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ need not be distinct ( $\\alpha$ can be a fixed point of $P$ ), but each of $\\alpha, \\beta$ is different from each of $a, b$. Applying property (1) to the four pairs of integers $(\\alpha, a),(\\beta, b)$, $(\\alpha, b),(\\beta, a)$ we get that the numbers $\\alpha-a$ and $\\beta-b$ divide each other, and also $\\alpha-b$ and $\\beta-a$ divide each other. Consequently\n\n$$\n\\alpha-b= \\pm(\\beta-a), \\quad \\alpha-a= \\pm(\\beta-b)\\tag{3}\n$$\n\nSuppose we have a plus in both instances: $\\alpha-b=\\beta-a$ and $\\alpha-a=\\beta-b$. Subtraction yields $a-b=b-a$, a contradiction, as $a \\neq b$. Therefore at least one equality in (3) holds with a minus sign. For each of them this means that $\\alpha+\\beta=a+b$; equivalently $a+b-\\alpha-P(\\alpha)=0$.\n\nDenote $a+b$ by $C$. We have shown that every integer fixed point of $Q$ other that $a$ and $b$ is a root of the polynomial $F(x)=C-x-P(x)$. This is of course true for $a$ and $b$ as well. And since $P$ has degree $n>1$, the polynomial $F$ has the same degree, so it cannot have more than $n$ roots. Hence the result.']"
