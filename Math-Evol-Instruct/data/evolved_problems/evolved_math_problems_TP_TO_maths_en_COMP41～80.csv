#Elements Identified#:
*   **Base Shape:** Unit square
*   **Subdivision:** Dissection into `n > 1` rectangles.
*   **Alignment:** Rectangle sides parallel to square's sides.
*   **Critical Condition:** Any line parallel to a side and in square's interior must intersect some rectangle's interior.
*   **Proof Conclusion:** Existence of a rectangle with no boundary point.
*   **Variables:** `n` (number of rectangles).
*   **Theme:** Geometric dissection satisfying a covering condition, guaranteeing an ""interior"" rectangle.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Increase Dimensionality/Scale:** Replace the unit square with a large `m x k` grid of unit squares (`m, k >= 2`). This introduces two parameters and forces consideration of a much more complex dissection structure. The dissection occurs on this grid.
2.  **Quantify the Conclusion:** Instead of proving the *existence* of one interior rectangle, demand the computation of the *maximum possible number* of rectangles that *do* touch the boundary (`γ`), across *all* dissections satisfying the condition for a specific grid and `n`. This transforms an existential question into a complex minimization problem over configurations.
3.  **Add Parameter-Dependent Answer Depth:** Make the answer depend explicitly on `m`, `k`, and `n`. Calculating the maximum `γ` requires understanding the combinatorial constraints imposed by the line condition on the grid layout.
4.  **Incorporate Optimization Constraint:** Introduce the condition that *all* rectangles must have a prescribed minimum perimeter `P_min`. This adds a geometric optimization layer, forcing rectangles to be ""non-trivial"" and interact strongly with the boundary condition, increasing the computational difficulty significantly.

A horizontal or vertical line, which intersects the interior of the square but does not intersect the interior of any rectangle, will be called a splitting line. A rectangle having no point on the boundary of the square will be called an interior rectangle.\n\nSuppose, to the contrary, that there exists a dissection of the square into more than one rectangle, such that no interior rectangle and no splitting line appear. Consider such a dissection with the least possible number of rectangles. Notice that this number of rectangles is greater than 2, otherwise their common side provides a splitting line.\n\nIf there exist two rectangles having a common side, then we can replace them by their union (see Figure 1). The number of rectangles was greater than 2, so in a new dissection it is greater than 1. Clearly, in the new dissection, there is also no splitting line as well as no interior rectangle. This contradicts the choice of the original dissection.\n\nDenote the initial square by $A B C D$, with $A$ and $B$ being respectively the lower left and lower right vertices. Consider those two rectangles $a$ and $b$ containing vertices $A$ and $B$, respectively. (Note that $a \\neq b$, otherwise its top side provides a splitting line.) We can assume that the height of $a$ is not greater than that of $b$. Then consider the rectangle $c$ neighboring to the lower right corner of $a$ (it may happen that $c=b$ ). By aforementioned, the heights of $a$ and $c$ are distinct. Then two cases are possible.\n\n<img_3797>\n\nFigure 1\n\n<img_4037>\n\nFigure 2\n\n<img_3752>\n\nFigure 3\n\nCase 1. The height of $c$ is less than that of $a$. Consider the rectangle $d$ which is adjacent to both $a$ and $c$, i. e. the one containing the angle marked in Figure 2. This rectangle has no common point with $B C$ (since $a$ is not higher than $b$ ), as well as no common point with $A B$ or with $A D$ (obviously). Then $d$ has a common point with $C D$, and its left side provides a splitting line. Contradiction.\n\nCase 2. The height of $c$ is greater than that of $a$. Analogously, consider the rectangle $d$ containing the angle marked on Figure 3. It has no common point with $A D$ (otherwise it has a common side with $a$ ), as well as no common point with $A B$ or with $B C$ (obviously). Then $d$ has a common point with $C D$.

 'Again, we suppose the contrary. Consider an arbitrary counterexample. Then we know that each rectangle is attached to at least one side of the square. Observe that a rectangle cannot be attached to two opposite sides, otherwise one of its sides lies on a splitting line.\n\nWe say that two rectangles are opposite if they are attached to opposite sides of $A B C D$. We claim that there exist two opposite rectangles having a common point.\n\nConsider the union $L$ of all rectangles attached to the left. Assume, to the contrary, that $L$ has no common point with the rectangles attached to the right. Take a polygonal line $p$ connecting the top and the bottom sides of the square and passing close from the right to the boundary of $L$ (see Figure 4). Then all its points belong to the rectangles attached either to the top or to the bottom. Moreover, the upper end-point of $p$ belongs to a rectangle attached to the top, and the lower one belongs to an other rectangle attached to the bottom. Hence, there is a point on $p$ where some rectangles attached to the top and to the bottom meet each other. So, there always exists a pair of neighboring opposite rectangles.\n\n<img_3470>\n\nFigure 4\n\n<img_3863>\n\nFigure 5\n\n<img_3721>\n\nFigure 6\n\nNow, take two opposite neighboring rectangles $a$ and $b$. We can assume that $a$ is attached to the left and $b$ is attached to the right. Let $X$ be their common point. If $X$ belongs to their horizontal sides (in particular, $X$ may appear to be a common vertex of $a$ and $b$ ), then these sides provide a splitting line (see Figure 5). Otherwise, $X$ lies on the vertical sides. Let $\\ell$ be the line containing these sides.\n\nSince $\\ell$ is not a splitting line, it intersects the interior of some rectangle. Let $c$ be such a rectangle, closest to $X$; we can assume that $c$ lies above $X$. Let $Y$ be the common point of $\\ell$ and the bottom side of $c$ (see Figure 6). Then $Y$ is also a vertex of two rectangles lying below $c$.\n\nSo, let $Y$ be the upper-right and upper-left corners of the rectangles $a^{\\prime}$ and $b^{\\prime}$, respectively. Then $a^{\\prime}$ and $b^{\\prime}$ are situated not lower than $a$ and $b$, respectively (it may happen that $a=a^{\\prime}$ or $b=b^{\\prime}$ ). We claim that $a^{\\prime}$ is attached to the left. If $a=a^{\\prime}$ then of course it is. If $a \\neq a^{\\prime}$ then $a^{\\prime}$ is above $a$, below $c$ and to the left from $b^{\\prime}$. Hence, it can be attached to the left only.\n\nAnalogously, $b^{\\prime}$ is attached to the right. Now, the top sides of these two rectangles pass through $Y$, hence they provide a splitting line again. This last contradiction completes the proof.']"

#Elements Identified#:  
- Variables: Initial sequence \(A_0 = (a_1, \ldots, a_n)\), sequence iterations \(A_k\) and \(A_{k+1}\), partition sets \(I\) and \(J\), element values \(x_i\) and \(y_i\).  
- Conditions: Partition \(\{1, \ldots, n\} = I \cup J\) must minimize \(\left| \sum_{i \in I} x_i - \sum_{j \in J} x_j \right|\), with sets allowed to be empty; ties in minimization are resolved arbitrarily.

- Theme: Deterministic sequential growth leading to an element with large absolute value, specifically \(|x| \geq n/2\).  
- Goal: Prove existence of \(k\) where some element satisfies the bound.  

### Step 2  
#Plan#:  
- Increase complexity by setting the initial sequence to \(a_i = i \) for \(i = 1\) to \(n\) (ensuring a non-trivial starting point with growth patterns).  
- Add detailed tie-breaking rules for partition selection: When minimizing the absolute difference, if multiple partitions achieve the minimum, choose the one that minimizes \(|I|\), and if still tied, minimize \(\sum_{i \in I} i\) (making the process fully deterministic and computationally intensive).  
- Alter the output request: Transform the proof requirement into a computational problem for fixed large \(n\) (e.g., \(n = 100\)) by asking for the exact iteration count \(k\) when \(\max |x_i|\) first exceeds \(n/2\), which demands simulation or pattern recognition for a numerical answer.  
- Justify complexity: The specific initial sequence and deterministic tie-breaking introduce dependencies on element indices and require precise computation. The fixed \(n = 100\) ensures non-trivial calculation without programming, while maintaining the core theme of iterative growth under minimization.

#Plan#:
1.  **Increase Dimensionality:** Change the object from a 2D rectangle to a 3D rectangular *box* (rectangular prism) with given side lengths $a, b, c$. This drastically increases vertices and combinatorial complexity.
2.  **Strengthen Color Constraint:** Require the vertices to satisfy a stricter condition: *every* face of the 3D box must be monochromatic (all four of its vertices same color). The ""global"" condition for the whole box in the original becomes explicitly ensured locally on each face here. This intertwines the coloring constraints geometrically.
3.  **Add Positioning Constraint:** Restrict the box vertices' coordinates. Instead of arbitrary positions, require precisely *two* vertices to lie on integer $x$-coordinates and *two* on half-integer $x$-coordinates ($\dots, -1.5, -0.5, 0.5, 1.5, \dots$).

Let $M$ be one of the cliques of largest size, $|M|=2 m$.

Each of them has been in a clique with $B \\cap M$ so they are also friends with all members of $B \\cap M$.\n\nHence, all members of $Q$ are friends with all members of $B \\cap M$.

1. **Transform proof to computation**: Replace the existence proof with a numerical computation task requiring a specific output. Specifically, fix a challenging value of $\alpha$ close to the bound and task finding the minimal $n$ satisfying the conditions.
2. **Increase computational complexity**: Choose $\alpha$ such that $\alpha = \frac{1}{3}$ (slightly below $\frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 0.382$ for a tighter constraint). This demands detailed small-$n$ case analysis.
3. **Add real-world constraint**: Introduce non-emptiness for subsets to avoid trivialities and ensure distinctness. Requires combinatorial enumeration for verification.
4. **Incorporate minimization**: Ask for the minimal $n$, forcing computation across multiple values and leveraging the exponential growth due to $p > \alpha \cdot 2^{n}$.

#Elements Identified#:  
- Quadrilateral ABCD: initially general convex, can be specified with coordinates or dimensions to add numerical complexity.  
- Point P on AB: arbitrary position, can be fixed at a specific ratio or coordinate to require calculation.  
- Incircles and tangency points: inclusion of ω, K, L makes geometry complex; tangency conditions can be computationally intensive with specific values.  
- Intersection points E (AC ∩ BD) and F (AK ∩ BL): coordinate-based computation replaces abstract collinearity proof.  
- Core theme: geometric configuration involving circles, tangency, and intersections; transformation to computational problem requires numerical output, such as a coordinate or length.  

### Step 2  
#Plan#:  
1. Specify quadrilateral: Use a rectangle ABCD with irrational side ratios (AB = √2 units, AD = ∛4 units) to complicate distance and angle calculations.  
2. Set P precisely: Position P at (2/(√3)) AB from A to introduce irrationals, demanding exact numerical output.  
3. Increase complexity: Instead of proving collinearity, require computation of the x-coordinate of F, which depends on solving multiple circle equations and line intersections, leveraging coordinate geometry.  
4. Add constraints: Impose a coordinate system with A at (0,0), B at (√2,0), etc., ensuring all values remain exact and challenging to compute.  
5. Ensure coherence: All points (K, L, E, I, F) are interconnected through tangency and intersection operations, pushing computational difficulty via irrational numbers and multi-step algebra.

- Change task from proof to computation: Replace the prove directive with finding a specific numerical value— the smallest \(b > N\) that satisfies the condition for \(k\) dividing \(N\) but is not a perfect \(n\)th power, forcing a search for minimal counterexamples within a bounded modulus set.
- Add dependency for complexity: Define \(N = n^{n+1}\), which grows rapidly with \(n\), ensuring computational non-triviality while maintaining logical ties to \(n\). This intensifies reasoning by requiring handling of CRT-like systems over divisors of \(N\).
- Increase reasoning depth: Implicitly demand computation of \(b\) through sieve methods or optimization over residue classes modulo many divisors, drawing from analytic number theory, to find the minimal such \(b\).

- **Objective**: Prove existence of infinitely many \(n\) satisfying the conditions.  
- **Core Theme**: Number theory properties of factorial valuations and infinitude, relying on growth and modular arithmetic.  

### Step 2

- **Increase Real-World Complexity**: Integrate deciphering whether \(r_p\) values are achievable or impose boundary conditions, and make \(d\) large to force significant computation. Ensure all elements interconnect via the valuation system mod \(d\) and primality, using that \(\nu_p(m!)\) depends on \(m\) via the cumulative sum formula.

#Elements Identified#:
- The set $\mathcal{S}$: Finite set of at least two points in the plane, with no three collinear.
- The pivot $P$: Starting point from $\mathcal{S}$ for the windmill.
- The starting line $\ell$: Line through $P$ that is used to initialize the rotation.
- The rotation process: Clockwise rotation around $P$ until a new point $Q \in \mathcal{S}$ is hit, then $Q$ becomes the new pivot.
- The core claim: Existence of a suitable $P$ and $\ell$ ensuring every point is pivot infinitely often.
- Theme: Geometric invariance and recurrence in a dynamic process with discrete events (pivot changes). Elements to manipulate: the configuration of $\mathcal{S}$ (e.g., regular polygon), the definition of the ""visit"" (e.g., finite-time coverage), and quantification (e.g., optimizing over parameters).

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. Modify the set $\mathcal{S}$: Restrict to vertices of a regular $n$-gon for integer $n \geq 3$, adding symmetry and geometric specificity, which enables computational analysis.
2. Transform the proof goal into a computational problem: Instead of existence of infinite visitation, compute a specific minimax value— the minimum, over all starting pivots $P$ and all starting angles $\alpha \in [0^\circ, 360^\circ)$, of the number of pivot changes needed until every point has been the pivot at least once. This requires quantifying the ""first coverage"" event.
3. Increase complexity by adding dependencies: Require a closed-form expression in $n$ for this minimax value, incorporating $n$ as a key parameter. This forces consideration of geometric symmetries, parity of $n$, and angular increments, making the computation nontrivial and mathematically deep.
4. Ensure interconnectedness: All components (regular polygon, minimax over $\alpha$ and $P$, dependence on $n$) link to the windmill's rotational dynamics and coverage properties, avoiding arbitrary variables.

- Transform from proof to computational problem with specific output: Require the numerical value (e.g., fraction or integer) of the sum, leveraging that it may not inherently be zero in 3D, and enforce exact arithmetic for the answer.

- **Variables**: Points \(A, B, C, D, E, F, I, K\); lines, circles, intersections.  
- **Conditions**: Triangle \(ABC\) isosceles with \(AB = AC\); \(D\) is the midpoint of \(AC\); \(E\) is inside \(\triangle ABC\); \(F\) is distinct from \(B\) on circle \(AEB\); all lines and intersections are defined based on geometric constructions.

**#Plan#**:  
1. **Assign specific side lengths** to transform the abstract proof into computation: Set \(AB = AC = 10\), \(BC = 12\). This introduces numerical computation and enables demanding exact-value calculations.  
2. **Shift goal to computational objective**: Instead of proving \(I\) is the incenter of \(\triangle KAB\), ask for the exact **inradius** of \(\triangle KAB\). This requires determining sides and area of \(\triangle KAB\) after applying the full construction.  
3. **Increase complexity by requiring specialized computations**: Solve for the inradius explicitly, which involves:  
   - Precise coordinate geometry or trigonometric setups (e.g., setting origin at \(BC\) midpoint, calculating vertex coordinates).  
   - Solving circle equations and intersections (e.g., circle through \(D, B, C\) and circle through \(A, E, B\)).  
   - Finding points \(E, F, I, K\) rigorously.  
   - Computing area and semiperimeter of \(\triangle KAB\), and deriving inradius algebraically.  
   - Ensuring exact answers with radicals and fractions, avoiding decimals.  
4. **Maintain logical coherence**: All steps are interconnected; the side lengths define positions, and the inradius requires \(K\) and \(I\) to be constructed as described. Avoid ambiguity by specifying lengths and demanding an exact answer.

Thus, either the triangles $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}$ and $A^{\\prime \\prime} B^{\\prime \\prime} C^{\\prime \\prime}$ are homothetic, or they are translates of each other. Now we will prove that they are in fact homothetic, and that the center $K$ of the homothety belongs\n\n\n\nto $\\omega$. It would then follow that their circumcircles are also homothetic with respect to $K$ and are therefore tangent at this point, as desired.\n\nWe need the two following claims.\n\nClaim 1. The point of intersection $X$ of the lines $B^{\\prime \\prime} C$ and $B C^{\\prime \\prime}$ lies on $t_{a}$.\n\nProof. Actually, the points $X$ and $T$ are symmetric about the line $B C$, since the lines $C T$ and $C B^{\\prime \\prime}$ are symmetric about this line, as are the lines $B T$ and $B C^{\\prime \\prime}$.\n\nClaim 2. The point of intersection $I$ of the lines $B B^{\\prime}$ and $C C^{\\prime}$ lies on the circle $\\omega$.\n\nProof. We consider the case that $t$ is not parallel to the sides of $A B C$; the other cases may be regarded as limit cases. Let $D=t \\cap B C, E=t \\cap A C$, and $F=t \\cap A B$.\n\nDue to symmetry, the line $D B$ is one of the angle bisectors of the lines $B^{\\prime} D$ and $F D$; analogously, the line $F B$ is one of the angle bisectors of the lines $B^{\\prime} F$ and $D F$. So $B$ is either the incenter or one of the excenters of the triangle $B^{\\prime} D F$. In any case we have $\\angle(B D, D F)+\\angle(D F, F B)+$ $\\angle\\left(B^{\\prime} B, B^{\\prime} D\\right)=90^{\\circ}$, so\n\n$$\n\\angle\\left(B^{\\prime} B, B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\right)=\\angle\\left(B^{\\prime} B, B^{\\prime} D\\right)=90^{\\circ}-\\angle(B C, D F)-\\angle(D F, B A)=90^{\\circ}-\\angle(B C, A B) .\n$$\n\nAnalogously, we get $\\angle\\left(C^{\\prime} C, B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\right)=90^{\\circ}-\\angle(B C, A C)$.

Let $K$ be the second intersection point of $B^{\\prime} B^{\\prime \\prime}$ and $\\omega$. Applying PASCAL's theorem to hexagon $K B^{\\prime \\prime} C I B C^{\\prime \\prime}$ we get that the points $B^{\\prime}=K B^{\\prime \\prime} \\cap I B$ and $X=B^{\\prime \\prime} C \\cap B C^{\\prime \\prime}$ are collinear with the intersection point $S$ of $C I$ and $C^{\\prime \\prime} K$. So $S=$ $C I \\cap B^{\\prime} X=C^{\\prime}$, and the points $C^{\\prime}, C^{\\prime \\prime}, K$ are collinear. Thus $K$ is the intersection point of $B^{\\prime} B^{\\prime \\prime}$ and $C^{\\prime} C^{\\prime \\prime}$ which implies that $K$ is the center of the homothety mapping $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}$ to $A^{\\prime \\prime} B^{\\prime \\prime} C^{\\prime \\prime}$, and it belongs to $\\omega$.""

#Elements Identified#:
- Primary function: \(f(d)\), defined as the smallest positive integer with exactly \(d\) positive divisors.
- Variables: \(d\) (number of divisors), \(k\) (non-negative integer exponent).
- Core condition: \(d = 2^k\) for \(k \geq 0\) in the proof, examining divisibility relation between \(f(2^k)\) and \(f(2^{k+1})\).
- Actions/processes: Verifying that \(f(2^k)\) divides \(f(2^{k+1})\) for all \(k \geq 0\).
- Theme: Properties of the minimal number with a given number of divisors, specifically for powers of 2, and their divisibility relationships.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. Change the divisor function argument to increase complexity: Replace \(d = 2^k\) with \(d = k \cdot 2^k\), which grows faster and introduces a multiplicative term depending on \(k\). This complicates divisor count, as \(k \cdot 2^k\) has more factors and varies with both exponents and linear growth.
2. Transform the proof task into a computational problem: Instead of proving divisibility, compute a specific value derived from \(f\) at a large, non-trivial \(k\) (e.g., \(k = 10\)) to ensure computational difficulty. The computation requires constructing the minimal number with a complex divisor count.
3. Add constraints and dependencies: Introduce that the number \(f(k \cdot 2^k)\) must be square-free (i.e., not divisible by any perfect square other than 1) to incorporate real-world mathematical constraints, which adds reasoning about prime factors and may force reevaluation of minimality. This connects to the theme by ensuring the solution uses distinct prime factors optimally.
4. Ensure coherence: All elements link logically—\(k\) defines \(d\) and constrains the form of \(f(d)\), while the computation for large \(k\) is challenging due to prime factorization and minimality under the square-free condition.

Furthermore, this difference is divisible by $f(a)$ and nonnegative since $f(n)=f(1)$ is the least value attained by $f$. So we have $f(n+a)-f(n)=0$, as desired.

#Elements Identified#:

*   Condition: No nonconstant polynomial with rational coefficients divides both (coprime in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$).
*   Condition: For every positive integer $n$, $P(n)>0$ and $Q(n)>0$.

*   Conclusion Proven: $Q(x)$ is constant.
*   Implicit Theme: The multiplicative order relationship between bases 2 and 3 must force $Q$ constant, relying on concepts like lifting the exponent and properties of cyclotomic polynomials derived from the divisibility condition.

#Plan#:
1.  **Introduce Additional Variable/Constraint:** Replace the fixed bases (2, 3) with parametric bases $a$ and $b$, demanding $a^{Q(n)} - 1$ divides $b^{P(n)} - 1$. Increase complexity by requiring $a$ and $b$ to be coprime integers greater than 1, searched for optimally relative to other constraints, rather than being fixed.
2.  **Introduce Higher Dimension/Additional Polynomial:** Add a *third* linear polynomial $R(x) = kx$ ($k \in \mathbb{N}^+$), representing a modulus, and change the quantification from ""for every $n$"" to ""for every $n \equiv 1 \pmod{R(n)}$"" or similar (concretizing the condition via congruence classes). This significantly changes the nature of the condition applied.
3.  **Demand Specific Computational Output (Hard Calculation):** Instead of proving $Q$ constant, *assume* $\deg(Q) = 1$ (making it non-constant by default but mimicking the contradiction case). Then, task is to *compute a specific value*: the minimal coefficient of $x^2$ in $P(x)$ (denoted $c$) satisfying the (now modified) condition, over all possible $P$, $Q$, $a$, $b$, $k$. This output requires finding an optimal configuration meeting numerous constraints simultaneously.
4.  **Add Concretization and Constraint Interdependence:** Fix specific forms: $Q(x) = dx + e$ ($d, e \in \mathbb{Z}^+$), $P(x) = cx^2 + ...$ (monic quadratic?). Add constraints required to utilize the core divisibility machinery: $c > 0$, $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, $\gcd(a, R(n)) = 1$ for relevant $n$. Ensure $a$, $b$, $k$ are linked to the computation of $c$ and each other.
5.  **Increase Realism/Complexity via Specific Optimization:** Require finding the minimal value $a_{\text{min}}$ for a specific $c$ output, tying $a$ directly to the core computation result's dependency. Set $k$ to a large, specific prime to enforce significant computation while ensuring primality interacts logically with the divisibility condition.

Hence, for each $i=0,1, \\ldots, k-1$, exactly half of the elements of $C_{i}$ are odd. The same statement is valid for $B_{i}=C_{i} \\backslash C_{i+1}$ for $0 \\leq i \\leq k-2$. In particular, each such $B_{i}$ contains an odd number. Note that $B_{k}=\\{1\\}$ also contains an odd number, and $B_{k-1}=\\left\\{2^{k}\\right\\}$ since $C_{k-1}$ consists of the two square roots of 1 modulo $n$.\n\nStep III. Now we construct a Hamiltonian cycle in the graph. First, for each $i$ with $0 \\leq i \\leq k$, connect the elements of $A_{i}$ to the elements of $B_{i}$ by means of an arbitrary bijection. After performing this for every $i$, we obtain a subgraph with all vertices having in-degree 1 and outdegree 1, so the subgraph is a disjoint union of cycles. If there is a unique cycle, we are done. Otherwise, we modify the subgraph in such a way that the previous property is preserved and the number of cycles decreases; after a finite number of steps we arrive at a single cycle.\n\nFor every cycle $C$, let $\\lambda(C)=\\min _{c \\in C} \\nu_{2}(c)$. Consider a cycle $C$ for which $\\lambda(C)$ is maximal. If $\\lambda(C)=0$, then for any other cycle $C^{\\prime}$ we have $\\lambda\\left(C^{\\prime}\\right)=0$. Take two arbitrary vertices $a \\in C$ and $a^{\\prime} \\in C^{\\prime}$ such that $\\nu_{2}(a)=\\nu_{2}\\left(a^{\\prime}\\right)=0$; let their direct successors be $b$ and $b^{\\prime}$, respectively. Then we can unify $C$ and $C^{\\prime}$ to a single cycle by replacing the edges $a \\rightarrow b$ and $a^{\\prime} \\rightarrow b^{\\prime}$ by $a \\rightarrow b^{\\prime}$ and $a^{\\prime} \\rightarrow b$.\n\nNow suppose that $\\lambda=\\lambda(C) \\geq 1$; let $a \\in C \\cap A_{\\lambda}$. If there exists some $a^{\\prime} \\in A_{\\lambda} \\backslash C$, then $a^{\\prime}$ lies in another cycle $C^{\\prime}$ and we can merge the two cycles in exactly the same way as above. So, the only remaining case is $A_{\\lambda} \\subset C$. Since the edges from $A_{\\lambda}$ lead to $B_{\\lambda}$, we get also $B_{\\lambda} \\subset C$. If $\\lambda \\neq k-1$ then $B_{\\lambda}$ contains an odd number; this contradicts the assumption $\\lambda(C)>0$. Finally, if $\\lambda=k-1$, then $C$ contains $2^{k-1}$ which is the only element of $A_{k-1}$. Since $B_{k-1}=\\left\\{2^{k}\\right\\}=A_{k}$ and $B_{k}=\\{1\\}$, the cycle $C$ contains the path $2^{k-1} \\rightarrow 2^{k} \\rightarrow 1$ and it contains an odd number again. This completes the proof of the ""only if""-part of the problem.']"

#Plan#:
1.  **Change Property & Target:** Replace the inequality proof $\mathbf{S_n \geq 0}$ with finding a **precise computational target**: the value modulo a large prime. This shifts from qualitative to exact quantitative.
2.  **Modify Sequence Logic:** Introduce an **auxiliary sequence** $\mathbf{A_t(\kappa)}$ defined using $x_\kappa$ but with added conditional dependence on a new time parameter $t$, creating a **cellular automaton-like** rule based on the *parity* of $t$ relative to the sum of the previous state values, forcing iterative recalculation. Use the original sequence position $\mathbf{\kappa}$ as the starting point (""seed"").

By Claim 2, we have $[a] \\neq\\left[n_{f}\\right]$, so $[a]$ should contain some element $a^{\\prime} \\geq b$ by Claim 2 again. If $a \\neq a^{\\prime}$, then $[a]$ contains two elements $\\geq a$ which is impossible by Claim 1 . Therefore, $a=a^{\\prime} \\geq b$. Similarly, $b \\geq a$.\n\nNow we are ready to prove the problem statement. First, we establish the following\n\nClaim 4. For every integer $d \\geq 0, f^{d+1}\\left(n_{f}\\right)=g^{d+1}\\left(n_{f}\\right)=a+d$.\n\nProof. Induction on $d$. For $d=0$, the statement follows from (1) and Claim 3. Next, for $d>1$ from the induction hypothesis we have $f^{d+1}\\left(n_{f}\\right)=f\\left(f^{d}\\left(n_{f}\\right)\\right)=f\\left(g^{d}\\left(n_{f}\\right)\\right)=f\\left(n_{f}\\right)+d=a+d$. The equality $g^{d+1}\\left(n_{f}\\right)=a+d$ is analogous.\n\n\n\nFinally, for each $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we have $f(x)=a+d$ for some $d \\geq 0$, so $f(x)=f\\left(g^{d}\\left(n_{f}\\right)\\right)$ and hence $x \\sim g^{d}\\left(n_{f}\\right)$. It follows that $g(x)=g\\left(g^{d}\\left(n_{f}\\right)\\right)=g^{d+1}\\left(n_{f}\\right)=a+d=f(x)$ by Claim 4 .'
 ""We start with the same observations, introducing the relation $\\sim$ and proving Claim 1 from the previous solution.\n\nNote that $f(a)>a$ since otherwise we have $f(a)=a$ and hence $g(a)=g(f(a))=g(a)+1$, which is false.\n\nClaim $2^{\\prime} . \\quad a=b$.\n\nProof. We can assume that $a \\leq b$. Since $f(a) \\geq a+1$, there exists some $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $f(a)=f(x)+1$, which is equivalent to $f(a)=f(g(x))$ and $a \\sim g(x)$. Since $g(x) \\geq b \\geq a$, by Claim 1 we have $a=g(x) \\geq b$, which together with $a \\leq b$ proves the Claim.\n\nNow, almost the same method allows to find the values $f(a)$ and $g(a)$.\n\nClaim $3^{\\prime} . \\quad f(a)=g(a)=a+1$.\n\nProof. Assume the contrary; then $f(a) \\geq a+2$, hence there exist some $x, y \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $f(x)=f(a)-2$ and $f(y)=g(x)($ as $g(x) \\geq a=b)$. Now we get $f(a)=f(x)+2=f\\left(g^{2}(x)\\right)$, so $a \\sim g^{2}(x) \\geq a$, and by Claim 1 we get $a=g^{2}(x)=g(f(y))=1+g(y) \\geq 1+a$; this is impossible. The equality $g(a)=a+1$ is similar.\n\nNow, we are prepared for the proof of the problem statement. First, we prove it for $n \\geq a$. Claim 4'. For each integer $x \\geq a$, we have $f(x)=g(x)=x+1$.\n\nProof. Induction on $x$. The base case $x=a$ is provided by Claim $3^{\\prime}$, while the induction step follows from $f(x+1)=f(g(x))=f(x)+1=(x+1)+1$ and the similar computation for $g(x+1)$.\n\nFinally, for an arbitrary $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ we have $g(n) \\geq a$, so by Claim $4^{\\prime}$ we have $f(n)+1=$ $f(g(n))=g(n)+1$, hence $f(n)=g(n)$.""]"
