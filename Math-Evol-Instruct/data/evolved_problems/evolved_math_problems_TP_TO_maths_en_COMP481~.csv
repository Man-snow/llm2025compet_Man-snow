- Distance function \(d(n)\) based on 3-adic valuation: \(d(n) = 3^{-k}\) if \(n = 3^{k} n'\) with \(k \geq 0\) and \(n'\) not divisible by 3.  
- Relocation shift of 18 (where \(v_3(18) = 2\)).  
- Houses: positive integers for occupied houses, City Hall at 0.  
- Original proof task: invariance of the distance between consecutive house numbers after relocation, which simplifies to \(d(1) = 1\) always, making the proof trivial.  
- Neighborhood concept \(\mathcal{N}(n)\): set of houses at same distance from City Hall.  
- Key for increasing complexity: Focus on the effect of relocation on families' distances to City Hall instead of consecutive distances, introduce computation of a proportion (limiting density) to handle infinite sets, and leverage the valuation shift.

  2. Computing a specific answer (fraction) via limiting density to deal with infinite houses.  
  3. Allowing for varying valuations and cancellations in distance calculations to require deeper analysis.  
- Ensure logical flow: Relocation moves families from \(n\) to \(n+18\), altering their distance to City Hall; compute the fraction for which \(d(n) \neq d(n+18)\).  
- For even more difficult problem: Generalize the base from 3 to a prime \(p\) and the shift to a general \(S\) with \(v_p(S) = l\), requiring the proportion as a function of \(l\).

- Focus the computation on Paul's new position after the shift (40) and involve the interaction between distance thresholds and congruence classes, specifically counting houses that satisfy the distance condition but contradict the broader ""2 side,"" introducing number theory constraints.

A resident desires the address π. His friends' houses are `s_p = 4 \cdot Σ_{k=0}^{p} (-1)^{k}/(2k+1)` for each prime `p`. Define `δ_p(m) = d(m - s_p)`.

2.  **House Set:** Initially positive integers, extended to rational numbers.
3.  **Target Property:** Desired address is the mathematical constant `e`, defined by the infinite series `Σ 1/n!`.
4.  **Friend Sequence:** Specific rational addresses given by partial sums of `e`: `s_c = Σ_{n=0}^c 1/n!`.
5.  **Core Proof Objective:** Show no rational number (or limit point) exists near the friend sequence under the metric defined by `d(m-n)`.
6.  **Neighborhood Concept:** `N(n) = {m | d(m) = d(n)}`, analogous to a circle.

3.  **Transform Proof to Quantitative Computation:** Instead of proving non-existence near the *infinite* sequence, ask for a **specific computation** for large `N` based on minimizing a distance measure to the *truncated* friend set.
4.  **Redefine Optimization Goal:** Find a house `m` (rational) minimizing the **maximum distance** `d(m - s_p)` to all friend houses `s_p` where `p` is prime and `p ≤ N` (for large `N`, e.g., 1000). ""Near friends"" becomes minimizing worst-case distance to closest cluster points.
5.  **Require Direct Output:** Demand computation of the minimal possible **maximum distance** and the corresponding `d(m)`.

His friends' houses correspond to the partial sums of the Leibniz series up to prime indices: `s_p = Σ_{k=0}^{p} (-1)^{k}/(2k+1)` for each prime `p`.

For a large fixed `N = 1000`, determine the minimal possible value `M` of `\max_{\text{prime } p ≤ N} δ_p(m)` over all rational house numbers `m`.

- Replace the fixed \(n\) with a variable and target the minimal \(n\) where the property (every sequence contains a cromulent element) fails for some sequence.  
- Increase complexity by introducing the concept of a sequence with ""no cromulent element,"" requiring identification of a critical \(n\) tied to advanced topics like covering systems in number theory.  
- Maintain all original elements (e.g., cromulent definition, consecutive sequence) to preserve theme cohesion.  
- Ensure logical flow: The output (minimal \(n\)) requires nontrivial computation or known mathematical results.  
- Avoid oversimplification: The new problem is harder than the original proof, as it involves determining an exact integer value that is not immediate and exceeds small cases.

1. **Modify the exception criterion**: Replace ""y is a power of 2"" with ""y is a Fibonacci number"" to complicate the exception set, as Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially but irregularly, increasing computational difficulty and requiring identification of Fibonacci numbers up to $m$.
2. **Add real-world constraints**: Require that each large prime used for covering ($p$ in $\{m+1, \ldots, 2m\}$) is congruent to $3 \pmod{4}$ to add modular constraints, making the covering step harder and introducing a primality filter.
3. **Increase complexity with a specific computation**: Instead of existence, ask for the exact count of $x$ mod $M$ (where $M$ is a large modulus) that produce a sequence with no cromulent elements, using the modified construction. This requires combining the lemma with explicit prime counts, solving transcendental equations for Fibonacci bounds, and handling residue classes.
4. **Maintain logical coherence**: Ensure the modifications interconnect: $m$ determines the Fibonacci exception set and the available large primes; the constraint $p \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$ affects the Chinese Remainder Theorem solution and coverage; and the modulus $M$ depends on the prime products. The sequence construction remains centered, and the lemma is used critically.
5. **Ensure difficulty**: Target $k = 500$ for specificity (as in $m = 125$), requiring computation of $\pi(250)$, $\pi(125)$, Fibonacci numbers up to 125, and solving multiple congruences.

- Increase complexity by scaling n: Set n=7 and p=3, making manual computation impractical and requiring combinatorial reasoning (7! = 5040 labels, 6^{7-3+1} = 6^5 = 7776 possible signatures).
- Add dynamic constraint: Introduce the requirement that every window in the signature must contain the relative order pattern 123 (increasing pattern) at least once, linking back to the idea in the original proof but complicating the count with dependencies.
- Enhance with numerical depth: Demand the exact numerical answer to quantify the count.
- Ensure coherence: Uniqueness depends on the signature not being shared, and the pattern constraint introduces real-world constraint on relative orders.

Step 3
#Rewritten Instruction#:
For $\boldsymbol{n=7}$ and $\boldsymbol{p=3}$, compute the number of 7-labels that have a unique 3-signature and whose signature contains at least one window with the increasing pattern 123 in every possible block.

Step 4
#Finally Rewritten Instruction#:
For $\boldsymbol{n=7}$ and $\boldsymbol{p=3}$, determine the number of 7-labels that have a unique 3-signature and contain at least one increasing window (pattern 123) in their signature.",success,98.79,"['We will prove this by contradiction. Suppose for some other 4-label $L$ we have $S_{3}[L]=$ $S_{3}[1234]=(123,123)$. Write out $L$ as $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}$. From the first window of $S_{3}[L]$, we have $a_{1}<a_{2}<a_{3}$. From the second window, we have $a_{2}<a_{3}<a_{4}$. Connecting these inequalities gives $a_{1}<a_{2}<a_{3}<a_{4}$, which forces $L=1234$, a contradiction. Therefore, the 3 -signature above is unique.']"
2866,"An $\boldsymbol{n}$-label is a permutation of the numbers 1 through $n$. For example, $J=35214$ is a 5 -label and $K=132$ is a 3 -label. For a fixed positive integer $p$, where $p \leq n$, consider consecutive blocks of $p$ numbers in an $n$-label. For example, when $p=3$ and $L=263415$, the blocks are 263,634,341, and 415. We can associate to each of these blocks a $p$-label that corresponds to the relative order of the numbers in that block. For $L=263415$, we get the following:

$$
\underline{263} 415 \rightarrow 132 ; \quad 2 \underline{63415} \rightarrow 312 ; \quad 26 \underline{341} 5 \rightarrow 231 ; \quad 263 \underline{415} \rightarrow 213
$$

Moving from left to right in the $n$-label, there are $n-p+1$ such blocks, which means we obtain an $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels. For $L=263415$, we get the 4 -tuple $(132,312,231,213)$. We will call this $(n-p+1)$-tuple the $\boldsymbol{p}$-signature of $L$ (or signature, if $p$ is clear from the context) and denote it by $S_{p}[L]$; the $p$-labels in the signature are called windows. For $L=263415$, the windows are $132,312,231$, and 213 , and we write

$$
S_{3}[263415]=(132,312,231,213)
$$

More generally, we will call any $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels a $p$-signature, even if we do not know of an $n$-label to which it corresponds (and even if no such label exists). A signature that occurs for exactly one $n$-label is called unique, and a signature that doesn't occur for any $n$-labels is called impossible. A possible signature is one that occurs for at least one $n$-label.

In this power question, you will be asked to analyze some of the properties of labels and signatures.

- Escape condition: all switches on at end of a minute.  
- $E(n,k)$: minimum minutes to escape, or infinity if impossible.  
- $I(n,k) = E(n,k) - \frac{n}{k}$ if $E(n,k) \neq \infty$, else undefined.  
- Original task: prove existential quantifier for large inefficiency.  
- Theme: achieving all-on state with constraints.  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
- **Modify flipping action**: Instead of any $k$ different switches, require flipping a block of exactly $k$ consecutive switches in the array to add spatial dependency.  
- **Introduce parameter for computation**: Define $n$ and $k$ in terms of a given parameter $m$ to scale complexity. Set $n = 2m + 1$ and $k = \lfloor \sqrt{m} \rfloor$ to ensure asymmetric sizes and large $m$ requires handling parity and alignment issues.  
- **Computational focus**: Replace proof with computation of $I(n,k)$ for large $m$, specifically for $m = 100$, making calculation non-trivial due to linear constraint and minuet optimization under consecutive flips.  
- **Ensure interconnectivity**: The consecutive flip constraint increases difficulty by introducing ordering and proximity effects, directly impacting $E(n,k)$ and inefficiency; the parameter $m$ forces computation with large numbers.

#Rewritten Instruction#:  
Elizabeth is in an ""escape room"" puzzle with $n$ light switches arranged in a line. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ consecutive light switches. The escape happens when all switches are on at the end of a minute. Define $E(n,k)$ as the minimum minutes to escape, or infinity if impossible. Define the inefficiency $I(n,k) = E(n,k) - \frac{n}{k}$ if $E(n,k) \neq \infty$. Compute $I(100, \lfloor \sqrt{100} \rfloor)$ for this puzzle.

#Finally Rewritten Instruction#:  
Elizabeth is in an ""escape room"" puzzle with $n$ light switches arranged in a line. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ consecutive light switches. The escape happens when all switches are on at the end of a minute. Define $E(n,k)$ as the minimum minutes to escape, or infinity if impossible. Define the inefficiency $I(n,k) = E(n,k) - \frac{n}{k}$ if $E(n,k) \neq \infty$. For $n = 101$ and $k = 10$, compute $I(101,10)$.",success,857.77,"['First, we prove that if $n$ is even and $k$ is odd, then $E(n, k)=E(n,n-k)$.\n\n\nBecause $n$ is even, and because each switch must be flipped an odd number of times in order to escape, the total number of flips is even. Because $k$ must be odd, $E(n, k)$ must be even. To show this, consider the case where $E(n, k)$ is odd. If $E(n, k)$ is odd, then an odd number of flips happen an odd number of times, resulting in an odd number of total flips. This is a contradiction because $n$ is even.\n\nCall a switch ""non-flipped"" in any given minute if it is not among the switches flipped in that minute. Because $E(n, k)$ (i.e., the total number of minutes) is even, and each switch is flipped an odd number of times, each switch must also be non-flipped an odd number of times. Therefore any sequence of flips that solves the "" $(n, k)$ puzzle"" can be made into a sequence of flips that solves the "" $(n, n-k)$ "" puzzle by interchanging flips and non-flips. These sequences last for the same number of minutes, and therefore $E(n, k)=E(n, n-k)$.\n\n\nLet $n=2 x$ and $k=2 x-1$ for some positive integer $x$. Then $n$ is even and $k$ is odd, so the above prove applies, and $E(n, k)=E(n, n-k)=E(n, 1)=2 x$. Therefore $I(n, k)=2 x-\\frac{2 x}{2 x-1}$. Because $x>2$, it follows that $\\frac{2 x}{2 x-1}<2<x$, so $I(n, k)>x$, as desired.']"
