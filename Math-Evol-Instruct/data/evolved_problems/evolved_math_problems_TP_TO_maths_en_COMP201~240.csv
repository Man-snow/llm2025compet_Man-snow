#Elements Identified#:
- **Variables**: The function \(f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}\), integers \(x, y\), and the integer \(v\) which is \(f\)-rare.
- **Conditions**: The functional equation \(f(f(x+y) + y) = f(f(x) + y)\) must hold for all \(x, y \in \mathbb{Z}\); for \(v\) to be \(f\)-rare, the set \(X_v = \{x \in \mathbb{Z} : f(x) = v\}\) must be finite and nonempty.
- **Participants**: The function \(f\) and the associated rare integer \(v\).
- **Actions**: Proving the uniqueness of the \(f\)-rare integer under the given constraints.
- **Theme**: Establishing a uniqueness property related to the finiteness of preimage sets under a functional equation constraint.

Step 2
#Plan#:
- **Modify the objective**: Replace the proof-based question (uniqueness) with a computational challenge (finding a specific numerical value) related to the finiteness property.
- **Focus on cardinality**: Instead of proving that there can be at most one rare integer, compute the minimum possible cardinality of \(X_v\) over all such functions \(f\) and all \(f\)-rare integers \(v\), introducing complexity by demanding optimization over an infinite set of functions.
- **Restrict to nontrivial instances**: Specify that we consider only functions with at least one \(f\)-rare integer, ensuring the minimization problem is well-defined and non-vacuous.
- **Add implicit parameters**: The quantization of the preimage size introduces a discrete minimization problem that requires deeper reasoning about the functional equation's structure and its implications for rare sets.

Since no component of $G$ with at least three vertices is complete we may assume that not all of the neighbours of $A$ are adjacent to one another. (For example, pick a maximal complete subgraph $K$ of $G^{\\prime}$. Some vertex $A$ of $K$ has a neighbour outside $K$, and this neighbour is not adjacent to every vertex of $K$ by maximality.) Removing $A$ from $G$ splits $G^{\\prime}$ into smaller connected components $G_{1}, \\ldots, G_{k}$ (possibly with $k=1$ ), to each of which $A$ is connected by at least one edge.

The vertices $B$ and $C$ are not adjacent, and hence removing edges $A B$ and $A C$ and adding in edge $B C$ does not disconnect $G^{\\prime}$. It is easy to see that this preserves the condition, since the refriending does not change the parity of the degrees of vertices.\n\nCase 2: $k \\geqslant 2$ and $A$ is connected to each $G_{i}$ by exactly one edge.\n\nConsider the induced subgraph on any $G_{i}$ and the vertex $A$. The vertex $A$ has degree 1 in this subgraph; since the number of odd-degree vertices of a graph is always even, we see that $G_{i}$ has a vertex of odd degree (in $G$ ). Thus if we let $B$ and $C$ be any distinct neighbours of $A$, then removing edges $A B$ and $A C$ and adding in edge $B C$ preserves the above condition: the refriending creates two new components, and if either of these components has at least three vertices, then it cannot be complete and must contain a vertex of odd degree (since each $G_{i}$ does).\n\nCase 3: $k=1$ and $A$ is connected to $G_{1}$ by at least three edges.\n\nBy assumption, $A$ has two neighbours $B$ and $C$ which are not adjacent to one another.

We are done unless this second component would be a complete graph on at least 3 vertices. But in this case, $G_{1}$ would be a complete graph minus the single edge $B C$, and hence has at least 4 vertices since $G^{\\prime}$ is not a 4-cycle.

One wants to prove that, via a sequence of such refriendings, one can reach a graph which is a disjoint union of single edges and vertices.\n\n\nnote that a refriending preserves the property that a graph has a vertex of odd degree and (trivially) the property that it is not complete; note also that our initial graph is connected. We describe an algorithm to reduce our initial graph to a graph of maximal degree at most 1 , proceeding in two steps.\n\nStep 1: There exists a sequence of refriendings reducing the graph to a tree.\n\nProof. Since the number of edges decreases with each refriending, it suffices to prove the following: as long as the graph contains a cycle, there exists a refriending such that the resulting graph is still connected. We will show that the graph in fact contains a cycle $Z$ and vertices $A, B, C$ such that $A$ and $B$ are adjacent in the cycle $Z, C$ is not in $Z$, and is adjacent to $A$ but not $B$. Removing edges $A B$ and $A C$ and adding in edge $B C$ keeps the graph connected, so we are done.\n\n<img_3186>\n\nTo find this cycle $Z$ and vertices $A, B, C$, we pursue one of two strategies. If the graph contains a triangle, we consider a largest complete subgraph $K$, which thus contains at least three vertices. Since the graph itself is not complete, there is a vertex $C$ not in $K$ connected to a vertex $A$ of $K$. By maximality of $K$, there is a vertex $B$ of $K$ not connected to $C$, and hence we are done by choosing a cycle $Z$ in $K$ through the edge $A B$.\n\n<img_3196>\n\nIf the graph is triangle-free, we consider instead a smallest cycle $Z$. This cycle cannot be Hamiltonian (i.e. it cannot pass through every vertex of the graph), since otherwise by minimality the graph would then have no other edges, and hence would have even degree at every vertex. We may thus choose a vertex $C$ not in $Z$ adjacent to a vertex $A$ of $Z$. Since the graph is triangle-free, it is not adjacent to any neighbour $B$ of $A$ in $Z$, and we are done.\n\nStep 2: Any tree may be reduced to a disjoint union of single edges and vertices by a sequence of refriendings.\n\nProof. The refriending preserves the property of being acyclic. Hence, after applying a sequence of refriendings, we arrive at an acyclic graph in which it is impossible to perform any further refriendings. The maximal degree of any such graph is 1: if it had a vertex $A$ with two neighbours $B, C$, then $B$ and $C$ would necessarily be nonadjacent since the graph is cycle-free, and so a refriending would be possible. Thus we reach a graph with maximal degree at most 1 as desired.']"

 'When tracing a cyclic path through the $A_{i}$ in order, with straight line segments between consecutive points, let $\\theta_{i}$ be the exterior angle at $A_{i}$, with a sign convention that it is positive if the path turns left and negative if the path turns right.

Let $\\phi_{i}=\\angle A_{i-1} A_{i} A_{i+1}$ (indices $\\bmod 2 n$ ), defined as in the problem; thus $\\phi_{i}=180^{\\circ}-\\left|\\theta_{i}\\right|$.\n\nLet $L$ be the set of $i$ for which the path turns left at $A_{i}$ and let $R$ be the set for which it turns right. Then $S=\\sum_{i \\in L} \\phi_{i}-\\sum_{i \\in R} \\phi_{i}=(180(|L|-|R|)-360 k)^{\\circ}$, which is a multiple of $360^{\\circ}$ since the number of points is even. We will show that the points can be labelled such that $S=0$, in which case $L$ and $R$ satisfy the required condition of the problem.\n\nNote that the value of $S$ is defined for a slightly larger class of configurations: it is OK for two points to coincide, as long as they are not consecutive, and OK for three points to be collinear, as long as $A_{i}, A_{i+1}$ and $A_{i+2}$ do not appear on a line in that order. In what follows it will be convenient, although not strictly necessary, to consider such configurations.\n\nConsider how $S$ changes if a single one of the $A_{i}$ is moved along some straight-line path (not passing through any $A_{j}$ and not lying on any line $A_{j} A_{k}$, but possibly crossing such lines). Because $S$ is a multiple of $360^{\\circ}$, and the angles change continuously, $S$ can only change when a point moves between $R$ and $L$. Furthermore, if $\\phi_{j}=0$ when $A_{j}$ moves between $R$ and $L, S$ is unchanged; it only changes if $\\phi_{j}=180^{\\circ}$ when $A_{j}$ moves between those sets.\n\nFor any starting choice of points, we will now construct a new configuration, with labels such that $S=0$, that can be perturbed into the original one without any $\\phi_{i}$ passing through $180^{\\circ}$, so that $S=0$ for the original configuration with those labels as well.\n\nTake some line such that there are $n$ points on each side of that line. The new configuration has $n$ copies of a single point on each side of the line, and a path that alternates between\n\n\n\nsides of the line; all angles are 0 , so this configuration has $S=0$. Perturbing the points into their original positions, while keeping each point on its side of the line, no angle $\\phi_{i}$ can pass through $180^{\\circ}$, because no straight line can go from one side of the line to the other and back. So the perturbation process leaves $S=0$.'
 'First, let $\\ell$ be a line in the plane such that there are $n$ points on one side and the other $n$ points on the other side. For convenience, assume $\\ell$ is horizontal (otherwise, we can rotate the plane). Then we can use the terms ""above"", ""below"", ""left"" and ""right"" in the usual way. We denote the $n$ points above the line in an arbitrary order as $P_{1}, P_{2}, \\ldots, P_{n}$, and the $n$ points below the line as $Q_{1}, Q_{2}, \\ldots, Q_{n}$.\n\nIf we connect $P_{i}$ and $Q_{j}$ with a line segment, the line segment will intersect with the line $\\ell$. Denote the intersection as $I_{i j}$. If $P_{i}$ is connected to $Q_{j}$ and $Q_{k}$, where $j<k$, then $I_{i j}$ and $I_{i k}$ are two different points, because $P_{i}, Q_{j}$ and $Q_{k}$ are not collinear.\n\nNow we define a ""sign"" for each angle $\\angle Q_{j} P_{i} Q_{k}$. Assume $j<k$. We specify that the sign is positive for the following two cases:\n\n- if $i$ is odd and $I_{i j}$ is to the left of $I_{i k}$,\n- if $i$ is even and $I_{i j}$ is to the right of $I_{i k}$.\n\nOtherwise the sign of the angle is negative. If $j>k$, then the sign of $\\angle Q_{j} P_{i} Q_{k}$ is taken to be the same as for $\\angle Q_{k} P_{i} Q_{j}$.\n\nSimilarly, we can define the sign of $\\angle P_{j} Q_{i} P_{k}$ with $j<k$ (or equivalently $\\angle P_{k} Q_{i} P_{j}$ ). For example, it is positive when $i$ is odd and $I_{j i}$ is to the left of $I_{k i}$.\n\nHenceforth, whenever we use the notation $\\angle Q_{j} P_{i} Q_{k}$ or $\\angle P_{j} Q_{i} P_{k}$ for a numerical quantity, it is understood to denote either the (geometric) measure of the angle or the negative of this measure, depending on the sign as specified above.\n\nWe now have the following important fact for signed angle measures:\n\n$$\n\\angle Q_{i_{1}} P_{k} Q_{i_{3}}=\\angle Q_{i_{1}} P_{k} Q_{i_{2}}+\\angle Q_{i_{2}} P_{k} Q_{i_{3}}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nfor all points $P_{k}, Q_{i_{1}}, Q_{i_{2}}$ and $Q_{i_{3}}$ with $i_{1}<i_{2}<i_{3}$. The following figure shows a ""natural"" arrangement of the points. Equation (1) still holds for any other arrangement, as can be easily verified.\n\n<img_3761>\n\nSimilarly, we have\n\n$$\n\\angle P_{i_{1}} Q_{k} P_{i_{3}}=\\angle P_{i_{1}} Q_{k} P_{i_{2}}+\\angle P_{i_{2}} Q_{k} P_{i_{3}},\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nfor all points $Q_{k}, P_{i_{1}}, P_{i_{2}}$ and $P_{i_{3}}$, with $i_{1}<i_{2}<i_{3}$.\n\n\n\nWe are now ready to specify the desired ordering $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ of the points:\n\n- if $i \\leqslant n$ is odd, put $A_{i}=P_{i}$ and $A_{2 n+1-i}=Q_{i}$;\n- if $i \\leqslant n$ is even, put $A_{i}=Q_{i}$ and $A_{2 n+1-i}=P_{i}$.\n\nFor example, for $n=3$ this ordering is $P_{1}, Q_{2}, P_{3}, Q_{3}, P_{2}, Q_{1}$. This sequence alternates between $P$ \'s and $Q$ \'s, so the above conventions specify a sign for each of the angles $A_{i-1} A_{i} A_{i+1}$. We claim that the sum of these $2 n$ signed angles equals 0 . If we can show this, it would complete the proof.\n\nWe prove the claim by induction. For brevity, we use the notation $\\angle P_{i}$ to denote whichever of the $2 n$ angles has its vertex at $P_{i}$, and $\\angle Q_{i}$ similarly.\n\nFirst let $n=2$. If the four points can be arranged to form a convex quadrilateral, then the four line segments $P_{1} Q_{1}, P_{1} Q_{2}, P_{2} Q_{1}$ and $P_{2} Q_{2}$ constitute a self-intersecting quadrilateral. We use several figures to illustrate the possible cases.\n\nThe following figure is one possible arrangement of the points.\n\n<img_3241>\n\nThen $\\angle P_{1}$ and $\\angle Q_{1}$ are positive, $\\angle P_{2}$ and $\\angle Q_{2}$ are negative, and we have\n\n$$\n\\left|\\angle P_{1}\\right|+\\left|\\angle Q_{1}\\right|=\\left|\\angle P_{2}\\right|+\\left|\\angle Q_{2}\\right| .\n$$\n\nWith signed measures, we have\n\n$$\n\\angle P_{1}+\\angle Q_{1}+\\angle P_{2}+\\angle Q_{2}=0\n\\tag{3}\n$$\n\nIf we switch the labels of $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$, we have the following picture:\n\n<img_3724>\n\nSwitching labels $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ has the effect of flipping the sign of all four angles (as well as swapping the magnitudes on the relabelled points); that is, the new values of $\\left(\\angle P_{1}, \\angle P_{2}, \\angle Q_{1}, \\angle Q_{2}\\right.$ ) equal the old values of $\\left(-\\angle P_{2},-\\angle P_{1},-\\angle Q_{1},-\\angle Q_{2}\\right)$. Consequently, equation (3) still holds. Similarly, when switching the labels of $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$, or both the $P$ \'s and the $Q$ \'s, equation (3) still holds.\n\n\n\nThe remaining subcase of $n=2$ is that one point lies inside the triangle formed by the other three.

Also, if the point lying inside the triangle of the other three is one of the $Q$ \'s rather than the $P$ \'s, the result still holds, since our sign convention is preserved when we relabel $Q$ \'s as $P$ \'s and vice-versa and reflect across $\\ell$.\n\nWe have completed the proof of the claim for $n=2$.\n\nAssume the claim holds for $n=k$, and we wish to prove it for $n=k+1$. Suppose we are given our $2(k+1)$ points. First ignore $P_{k+1}$ and $Q_{k+1}$, and form $2 k$ angles from $P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{k}$, $Q_{1}, \\ldots, Q_{k}$ as in the $n=k$ case. By the induction hypothesis we have\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\left(\\angle P_{i}+\\angle Q_{i}\\right)=0\n$$\n\nWhen we add in the two points $P_{k+1}$ and $Q_{k+1}$, this changes our angles as follows:\n\n- the angle at $P_{k}$ changes from $\\angle Q_{k-1} P_{k} Q_{k}$ to $\\angle Q_{k-1} P_{k} Q_{k+1}$;\n- the angle at $Q_{k}$ changes from $\\angle P_{k-1} Q_{k} P_{k}$ to $\\angle P_{k-1} Q_{k} P_{k+1}$;\n- two new angles $\\angle Q_{k} P_{k+1} Q_{k+1}$ and $\\angle P_{k} Q_{k+1} P_{k+1}$ are added.\n\nWe need to prove the changes have no impact on the total sum. In other words, we need to prove\n\n$$\n\\left(\\angle Q_{k-1} P_{k} Q_{k+1}-\\angle Q_{k-1} P_{k} Q_{k}\\right)+\\left(\\angle P_{k-1} Q_{k} P_{k+1}-\\angle P_{k-1} Q_{k} P_{k}\\right)+\\left(\\angle P_{k+1}+\\angle Q_{k+1}\\right)=0\n$$\n\nIn fact, from equations (1) and (2), we have\n\n$$\n\\angle Q_{k-1} P_{k} Q_{k+1}-\\angle Q_{k-1} P_{k} Q_{k}=\\angle Q_{k} P_{k} Q_{k+1}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\angle P_{k-1} Q_{k} P_{k+1}-\\angle P_{k-1} Q_{k} P_{k}=\\angle P_{k} Q_{k} P_{k+1} .\n$$\n\nTherefore, the left hand side of equation (4) becomes $\\angle Q_{k} P_{k} Q_{k+1}+\\angle P_{k} Q_{k} P_{k+1}+\\angle Q_{k} P_{k+1} Q_{k+1}+$ $\\angle P_{k} Q_{k+1} P_{k+1}$, which equals 0 , simply by applying the $n=2$ case of the claim. This completes the induction.'

2. **Introduce adversarial elements**: The King answers queries adversarially; for each query, he picks the direction that maximizes the uncertainty, decreasingAlice's confidence in estimating degrees.
3. **Increase uncertainty with partial information**: Alice must compute the minimum out-degree without knowing the full graph. She only accesses \( 4n/2 = 2n \) towns’ incident roads (since \( 4n \) queries involve \( 8n \) directed pairs, covering about \( 2n \) towns on average). This forces complex probability-driven updates.
4. **Add real-world constraint**: Introduce ""weather effect"": A subset of roads changes direction midway. Specifically, after \( 2n \) queries, a set \( W \) of vertices suffers reversed road directions. \( W \) depends on adjacency to queried edges. This couples queries with dynamic dependencies and forces Bayesian probability integration.
5. **Enhance complexity**: Output is the minimum out-degree over towns, computed with uncertainty. Alice must provide a confidence interval (integer range [L, R]) containing the true minimum at probability ≥ 90%, using query-induced data and probability models. The problem becomes combinatorial and probabilistic.

### Step 3
**#Rewritten Instruction#**:
Alice is in Wonderland with \( n \geqslant 2 \) towns, where every pair of towns has a one-way road initially hidden. She queries the King of Hearts for their directions, but he responds adversarially per query. After \( 2n \) queries, all towns adjacent to at least \( \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor \) queried roads suffer ""weather effect,"" causing all incident roads to randomly reverse direction independently with probability 0.5. Alice must output a confidence interval for the minimum out-degree over all towns using a strategy of at most \( 4n \) queries, ensuring the interval contains the true value with probability 0.9 or higher.

### Step 4
**#Finally Rewritten Instruction#**:
Alice has a map of Wonderland, analyzing one-way roads among \( n \geqslant 2 \) towns. The King answers her directional queries adversarially. After \( 2n \) queries, all towns adjacent to at least \( \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor \) existing queried roads endure weather-induced random road-direction reversals (probability 0.5 for each). With at most \( 4n \) queries, Alice must output an interval explaining her final estimation: a confidence interval for the minimum out-degree that contains its value with at least 90% probability.",success,171.9,"[""We will show Alice needs to ask at most $4 n-7$ questions. Her strategy has the following phases. In what follows, $S$ is the set of towns that Alice, so far, does not know to have more than one outgoing road (so initially $|S|=n$ ).\n\nPhase 1. Alice chooses any two towns, say $A$ and $B$. Without loss of generality, suppose that the King of Hearts' answer is that the road goes from $A$ to $B$.\n\nAt the end of this phase, Alice has asked 1 question.\n\nPhase 2. During this phase there is a single (variable) town $T$ that is known to have at least one incoming road but not yet known to have any outgoing roads. Initially, $T$ is $B$. Alice does the following $n-2$ times: she picks a town $X$ she has not asked about before, and asks the direction of the road between $T$ and $X$. If it is from $X$ to $T, T$ is unchanged; if it is from $T$ to $X, X$ becomes the new choice of town $T$, as the previous $T$ is now known to have an outgoing road.\n\nAt the end of this phase, Alice has asked a total of $n-1$ questions. The final town $T$ is not yet known to have any outgoing roads, while every other town has exactly one outgoing road known. The undirected graph of roads whose directions are known is a tree.\n\nPhase 3. During this phase, Alice asks about the directions of all roads between $T$ and another town she has not previously asked about, stopping if she finds two outgoing roads from $T$. This phase involves at most $n-2$ questions. If she does not find two outgoing roads from $T$, she has answered her original question with at most $2 n-3 \\leqslant 4 n-7$ questions, so in what follows we suppose that she does find two outgoing roads, asking a total of $k$ questions in this phase, where $2 \\leqslant k \\leqslant n-2$ (and thus $n \\geqslant 4$ for what follows).\n\nFor every question where the road goes towards $T$, the town at the other end is removed from $S$ (as it already had one outgoing road known), while the last question resulted in $T$ being removed from $S$. So at the end of this phase, $|S|=n-k+1$, while a total of $n+k-1$ questions have been asked. Furthermore, the undirected graph of roads within $S$ whose directions are known contains no cycles (as $T$ is no longer a member of $S$, all questions asked in this phase involved $T$ and the graph was a tree before this phase started). Every town in $S$ has exactly one outgoing road known (not necessarily to another town in $S$ ).\n\nPhase 4. During this phase, Alice repeatedly picks any pair of towns in $S$ for which she does not know the direction of the road between them. Because every town in $S$ has exactly one outgoing road known, this always results in the removal of one of those two towns from $S$. Because there are no cycles in the graph of roads of known direction within $S$, this can continue until there are at most 2 towns left in $S$.\n\nIf it ends with $t$ towns left, $n-k+1-t$ questions were asked in this phase, so a total of $2 n-t$ questions have been asked.\n\nPhase 5. During this phase, Alice asks about all the roads from the remaining towns in $S$ that she has not previously asked about. She has definitely already asked about any road between those towns (if $t=2$ ). She must also have asked in one of the first two phases about\n\n\n\nat least one other road involving one of those towns (as those phases resulted in a tree with $n>2$ vertices). So she asks at most $t(n-t)-1$ questions in this phase.\n\nAt the end of this phase, Alice knows whether any town has at most one outgoing road. If $t=1$, at most $3 n-3 \\leqslant 4 n-7$ questions were needed in total, while if $t=2$, at most $4 n-7$ questions were needed in total.""]"

*   **Proof Nature:** The instruction requires demonstrating a geometric property (parallelism).

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Concretize Triangle & Circle:** Assign specific, non-trivial coordinates to vertices A, B, C. Introduce a parameter defining circle Γ *not* by its center on a line of symmetry but a point (x_c, y_c), constrained by passing through A, with a variable radius parameter `r`. This forces solving circle equations involving `r`.
2.  **Amplify Computational Load:** Require computing a specific numerical output intrinsically tied to the complex construction. Instead of proving parallelism, require the numerical length of segment AT, thus embedding the parallelism property (as AT || BC *enables* the length calculation via similar triangles or coordinate shifts) into a demanding computation. The calculation complexity arises from intersecting circles, finding tangents, solving for T, and finally computing distance.
3.  **Maintain & Hide Complexity:** Preserve all original circle definitions and tangent constructions but require dealing with the introduced coordinates and parameter `r` to get a numerical result (|AT|). This intrinsically incorporates the original geometric logic but elevates it into coordinate geometry hell. Avoid conflicting constraints, ensuring all conditions (points existing, tangency) are possible with the given coordinates and range of `r`.

1.  **Replace Abstract Triangle:** Replace the arbitrary triangle ABC with a specific, calculable, non-right-angled scalene triangle (e.g., side lengths 13, 14, 15 for integer coordinates/areas).
2.  **Specify Point P Location:** Instead of an arbitrary interior point P, define its location precisely using concrete constraints on its barycentric coordinates relative to the cevians, specifically by imposing fixed ratios (e.g., PA1/AA1 = k, PB1/BB1 = m, PC1/CC1 = n) or area ratios (e.g., areas of triangles PBC, PCA, PAB fixed relative to ABC).
3.  **Convert Conclusion into Quantitative Measure:** Instead of the Boolean ""cannot all lie inside"", require the calculation of *numerical value* quantifying how much they simultaneously lie *outside*. Specifically, compute the minimum value of (distance from circumcircle center to farthest point among A2, B2, C2) minus the circumradius. This value being non-negative confirms they can't all be strictly inside.
4.  **Increase Computational Burden:** Force complex coordinate geometry calculations by choosing computationally inconvenient ratios fixing P and requiring the specific numerical computation in step 3.

- Variables: Vertices $A, B, C, D, E$ forming a convex pentagon; point $P$ inside the pentagon; lengths $CD = DE$; angles $\angle EDC$ and $\angle ADB$; areas of polygons (triangles $BCD, ADE, ABD, ABP$).
- Conditions: $CD = DE$, $\angle EDC \neq 2 \cdot \angle ADB$, $AP = AE$, $BP = BC$, and area equality for the iff statement regarding $P$ on diagonal $CE$.
- Participants: Points $A, B, C, D, E, P$, and the diagonal $CE$.
- Actions/Processes: Proving that $P$ lies on $CE$ iff a specific area equality holds, involving geometric properties and calculations.
- Theme: Geometry of a convex pentagon with given symmetries and a point constrained by equal distances, leading to an area-based condition for collinearity.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. Replace the proof requirement with a computational task by specifying numerical coordinates for all vertices and asking for a precise numerical output, namely the length of $CE$, when the area condition holds and $P$ is on $CE$. This transforms the logical iff into a calculation driver.
2. Introduce coordinate geometry explicitly to enhance complexity, placing $D$ at $(0,0)$, $C$ at $(5,0)$ (so $CD=5$), $E$ at $(0,5)$ (so $DE=5$ and $\angle CDE = 90^\circ$), and setting $A$ and $B$ at $(2,6)$ and $(4,3)$ respectively, forcing coordinate-based calculations for $P$ and areas.
3. Add layers of calculation by requiring the areas to be computed numerically using shoelace formula, solving for $P$ via circle intersections, and deriving $CE$ length under the area equality, which introduces dependencies on coordinate distances and area formulas.
4. Maintain pentagon complexity by ensuring convexity with given points and incorporating the angle condition through coordinates (here, $\angle EDC = 90^\circ$, which is not twice $\angle ADB$ as computed).
5. Increase difficulty by demanding an exact fractional or radical value for simplicity, avoiding trivial outputs, and ensuring all steps (area sums, point location) are intertwined for a non-trivial solution.

Convexity ensures that $P^{\\prime}$ is distinct from both $E$ and $C$, and hence from both $M$ and $N$. We claim that both the area condition and the collinearity condition in the problem are equivalent to the condition that the (possibly degenerate) right-angled triangles $A P^{\\prime} M$ and $B P^{\\prime} N$ are directly similar (equivalently, $A P^{\\prime} E$ and $B P^{\\prime} C$ are directly similar).\n\n<img_3346>\n\nFor the equivalence with the collinearity condition, let $F$ denote the foot of the perpendicular from $P^{\\prime}$ to $A B$, so that $F$ is the midpoint of $P P^{\\prime}$.

This would violate the angle inequality $\\angle E D C \\neq 2 \\cdot \\angle A D B$ given in the question.\n\nNext, let $E^{\\prime}$ denote the second point of intersection of $P^{\\prime} E$ with $\\Gamma$, and let $E^{\\prime \\prime}$ denote the point on $\\Gamma$ diametrically opposite $E^{\\prime}$, so that $E^{\\prime \\prime} E$ is perpendicular to $P^{\\prime} E$.

The point $P^{\\prime}$ does not lie on the line $C E$. To see this, we let $A^{\\prime \\prime}$ and $B^{\\prime \\prime}$ be the points obtained from $A$ and $B$ by dilating with scale factor 2 about $P^{\\prime}$, so that $P$ is the orthogonal projection of $P^{\\prime}$ onto $A^{\\prime \\prime} B^{\\prime \\prime}$. Since $A$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $P^{\\prime} E$, the triangle $A^{\\prime \\prime} E P^{\\prime}$ is right-angled at $E$ (and $B^{\\prime \\prime} C P^{\\prime}$ similarly). If $P^{\\prime}$ were to lie on $C E$, then the lines $A^{\\prime \\prime} E$ and $B^{\\prime \\prime} C$ would be perpendicular to $C E$ and $A^{\\prime \\prime}$ and $B^{\\prime \\prime}$ would lie on the opposite side of $C E$ to $D$. It follows that the line $A^{\\prime \\prime} B^{\\prime \\prime}$ does not meet triangle $C D E$, and hence point $P$ does not lie inside $C D E$. But then $P$ must lie inside $A B C E$, and it is clear that such a point cannot reflect to a point $P^{\\prime}$ on $C E$.\n\nWe thus let $O$ be the centre of the circle $C E P^{\\prime}$.

So, $O$ and $D$ must be distinct. Since $f$ is linear and vanishes at $O$, it follows that $f(D)=0$ if and only if $f$ is constant zero - we want to show this occurs if and only if $C, P, E$ are collinear.\n<img_3610>\n\nIn the one direction, suppose firstly that $C, P, E$ are not collinear, and let $T$ be the centre of the circle $C E P$.

We will show that $f$ is constant zero by finding a second point (other than $O$ ) at which it vanishes.\n\n<img_3865>\n\nLet $Q$ be the reflection of $P$ across the midpoint of $A B$, so $P A Q B$ is a parallelogram. It is easy to see that $Q$ is on the perpendicular bisector of $C E$; for instance if $A^{\\prime}$ and $B^{\\prime}$ are the points produced from $A$ and $B$ by dilating about $P$ with scale factor 2 , then the projection of $Q$ to $C E$ is the midpoint of the projections of $A^{\\prime}$ and $B^{\\prime}$, which are $E$ and $C$ respectively. The triangles $B C Q$ and $A Q E$ are indirectly congruent, so\n\n$$\nf(Q)=(\\operatorname{area}(B C Q)+\\operatorname{area}(A Q E))-(\\operatorname{area}(A B Q)-\\operatorname{area}(B A P))=0-0=0\n$$\n\nThe points $O$ and $Q$ are distinct. To see this, consider the circle $\\omega$ centred on $Q$ with $P^{\\prime}$ on the circumference; since triangle $P P^{\\prime} Q$ is right-angled at $P^{\\prime}$, it follows that $P$ lies outside $\\omega$. On the other hand, $P$ lies between $C$ and $E$ on the line $C P E$. It follows that $C$ and $E$ cannot both lie on $\\omega$, so that $\\omega$ is not the circle $C E P^{\\prime}$ and $Q \\neq O$.\n\nSince $O$ and $Q$ are distinct zeroes of the linear function $f$, we have $f(D)=0$ as desired.']"

Key manipulation potential:  
1. Make the triangle specific (e.g., assign side lengths to avoid ambiguity).  
2. Shift the proof request to a computational outcome (e.g., compute a distance or length).  
3. Increase complexity by requiring a specific numerical answer with radicals or fractions for a non-trivial triangle.  
4. Ensure the computation is complex due to coordinate geometry or extensive algebraic manipulations.  

**Step 2**  
#Plan#:  
1. Fix the triangle with specific side lengths to eliminate generality: Choose a known acute-angled scalene triangle with manageable but non-integer coordinate calculations. The triangle with sides $BC = 15$, $AB = 13$, and $AC = 14$ is scalable and works.  
2. Convert the conclusion to a computational task: Instead of proving $S$ lies on the external angle bisector, compute an exact measure. The distance $AS$ is suitable and requires geometric computations.  
3. Increase difficulty:  
   - Use the specific triangle for numerical computation, leading to complex fractional coordinates (e.g., points involve fractions like $\frac{33}{5}$).  
   - Require the answer as an exact value with radicals/simplified fractions, demanding careful algebraic handling.  
4. Ensure logical flow: Retain all constructions and key points ($D,I,P,Q,S$) to maintain foundational properties. The solution will require understanding directed angles, circle equations, perpendiculars, and circumcircle intersections.

Let $D, E, F$ denote the points $f(B C), f(A C), f(A B)$, respectively. Then $g(A)$, $g(B)$ and $g(C)$ are the circumcircles of $A E F, B D F$ and $C D E$, respectively. Let $P \\neq F$ be the second intersection of circles $g(A)$ and $g(B)$ (or, if these circles are tangent at $F$, then $P=F$ ). By Miquel's theorem (or an easy angle chase), $g(C)$ also passes through $P$. Then by the cyclic quadrilaterals, the directed angles\n\n$$\n\\angle(P D, D C)=\\angle(P F, F B)=\\angle(P E, E A)=\\alpha\n$$\n\nfor some angle $\\alpha$. Hence, lines $A B, B C$ and $C A$ are all $(P, \\alpha)$-good, so by Lemma $3, A, B$ and $C$ are $(P, \\alpha)$-good. (In the case where $P=D$, the line $P D$ in the equation above denotes the line which is tangent to $g(B)$ at $P=D$. Similar definitions are used for $P E$ and $P F$ in the cases where $P=E$ or $P=F$.)\n\nConsider the set $\\Omega$ of all points $(x, y)$ with integer coordinates $1 \\leqslant x, y \\leqslant 1000$, and consider the set $L_{\\Omega}$ of all horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines passing through at least one point in $\\Omega$. A simple counting argument shows that there are 5998 lines in $L_{\\Omega}$. For each line $\\ell$ in $L_{\\Omega}$ we colour the point $f(\\ell)$ red. Then there are at most 5998 red points. Now we partition the points in $\\Omega$ into 10000 ten by ten squares. Since there are at most 5998 red points, at least one of these squares $\\Omega_{10}$ contains no red points. Let $(m, n)$ be the bottom left point in $\\Omega_{10}$. Then the triangle with vertices $(m, n),(m+1, n)$ and $(m, n+1)$ satisfies the condition of Lemma 5 , so these three vertices are all $(P, \\alpha)$-good for some point $P$ and angle $\\alpha$, as are the lines joining them. From this point on, we will simply call a point or line good if it is $(P, \\alpha)$-good for this particular pair $(P, \\alpha)$. Now by Lemma 1 , the line $x=m+1$ is good, as is the line $y=n+1$. Then Lemma 3 implies that $(m+1, n+1)$ is good. By applying these two lemmas repeatedly, we can prove that the line $x+y=m+n+2$ is good, then the points $(m, n+2)$ and $(m+2, n)$ then the lines $x=m+2$ and $y=n+2$, then the points $(m+2, n+1),(m+1, n+2)$ and $(m+2, n+2)$ and so on until we have prove that all points in $\\Omega_{10}$ are good.\n\nNow we will use this to prove that every point $S \\neq P$ is good. Since $g(S)$ is a circle, it passes through at most two points of $\\Omega_{10}$ on any vertical line, so at most 20 points in total. Moreover, any line $\\ell$ through $S$ intersects at most 10 points in $\\Omega_{10}$. Hence, there are at least eight lines $\\ell$ through $S$ which contain a point $Q$ in $\\Omega_{10}$ which is not on $g(S)$. Since $Q$ is not on $g(S)$, the point $f(\\ell) \\neq Q$. Hence, by Lemma 1, the line $\\ell$ is good. Hence, at least eight good lines pass through $S$, so by Lemma 4 , the point $S$ is good. Hence, every point $S \\neq P$ is good, so by Lemma 2 , every line is good. In particular, every line $\\ell$ passing through $P$ is good, and therefore satisfies $f(\\ell)=P$, as required.""
 ""Note that for any distinct points $X, Y$, the circles $g(X)$ and $g(Y)$ meet on $X Y$ at the point $f(X Y) \\in g(X) \\cap g(Y) \\cap(X Y)$.

The circles $g(X), g(Y)$ and $g(Z)$ through the vertices of triangle $X Y Z$ meet pairwise on the corresponding edges (produced).

Pick a point $X$ not on $\\ell$ or any of the circles $g\\left(Y_{i}\\right)$. Reordering the indices if necessary, we may suppose that $Y_{1}, \\ldots, Y_{4}$ do not lie on $g(X)$, so that $f\\left(X Y_{i}\\right) \\notin\\left\\{X, Y_{i}\\right\\}$ for $1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant 4$.

Note that either $O$ does not lie on $\\ell$, or $O=f(\\ell)$, since $O \\in g\\left(Y_{i}\\right)$.\n\nNow consider an arbitrary point $X^{\\prime}$ not on $\\ell$ or any of the circles $g\\left(Y_{i}\\right)$ for $1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant 4$. As above, we see that there are two indices $1 \\leqslant i<j \\leqslant 4$ such that $Y_{i}$ and $Y_{j}$ do not lie on $g\\left(X^{\\prime}\\right)$.

 'Notice that, for any two different points $X$ and $Y$, the point $f(X Y)$ lies on both $g(X)$ and $g(Y)$, so any two such circles meet in at least one point. We refer to two circles as cutting only in the case where they cross, and so meet at exactly two points, thus excluding the cases where they are tangent or are the same circle.\n\nLemma 1. Suppose there is a point $P$ such that all circles $g(X)$ pass through $P$. Then $P$ has the given property.\n\nProof. Consider some line $\\ell$ passing through $P$, and suppose that $f(\\ell) \\neq P$. Consider some $X \\in \\ell$ with $X \\neq P$ and $X \\neq f(\\ell)$. Then $g(X)$ passes through all of $P, f(\\ell)$ and $X$, but those three points are collinear, a contradiction.\n\nLemma 2. Suppose that, for all $\\epsilon>0$, there is a point $P_{\\epsilon}$ with $g\\left(P_{\\epsilon}\\right)$ of radius at most $\\epsilon$. Then there is a point $P$ with the given property.\n\nProof. Consider a sequence $\\epsilon_{i}=2^{-i}$ and corresponding points $P_{\\epsilon_{i}}$. Because the two circles $g\\left(P_{\\epsilon_{i}}\\right)$ and $g\\left(P_{\\epsilon_{j}}\\right)$ meet, the distance between $P_{\\epsilon_{i}}$ and $P_{\\epsilon_{j}}$ is at most $2^{1-i}+2^{1-j}$. As $\\sum_{i} \\epsilon_{i}$ converges, these points converge to some point $P$. For all $\\epsilon>0$, the point $P$ has distance at most $2 \\epsilon$ from $P_{\\epsilon}$, and all circles $g(X)$ pass through a point with distance at most $2 \\epsilon$ from $P_{\\epsilon}$, so distance at most $4 \\epsilon$ from $P$. A circle that passes distance at most $4 \\epsilon$ from $P$ for all $\\epsilon>0$ must pass through $P$, so by Lemma 1 the point $P$ has the given property.\n\nLemma 3. Suppose no two of the circles $g(X)$ cut. Then there is a point $P$ with the given property.\n\nProof. Consider a circle $g(X)$ with centre $Y$. The circle $g(Y)$ must meet $g(X)$ without cutting it, so has half the radius of $g(X)$. Repeating this argument, there are circles with arbitrarily small radius and the result follows by Lemma 2 .\n\nLemma 4. Suppose there are six different points $A, B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}, B_{4}, B_{5}$ such that no three are collinear, no four are concyclic, and all the circles $g\\left(B_{i}\\right)$ cut pairwise at $A$. Then there is a point $P$ with the given property.\n\nProof. Consider some line $\\ell$ through $A$ that does not pass through any of the $B_{i}$ and is not tangent to any of the $g\\left(B_{i}\\right)$. Fix some direction along that line, and let $X_{\\epsilon}$ be the point on $\\ell$ that has distance $\\epsilon$ from $A$ in that direction. In what follows we consider only those $\\epsilon$ for which $X_{\\epsilon}$ does not lie on any $g\\left(B_{i}\\right)$ (this restriction excludes only finitely many possible values of $\\epsilon$ ).\n\nConsider the circle $g\\left(X_{\\epsilon}\\right)$. Because no four of the $B_{i}$ are concyclic, at most three of them lie on this circle, so at least two of them do not. There must be some sequence of $\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0$ such that it is the same two of the $B_{i}$ for all $\\epsilon$ in that sequence, so now restrict attention to that sequence, and suppose without loss of generality that $B_{1}$ and $B_{2}$ do not lie on $g\\left(X_{\\epsilon}\\right)$ for any $\\epsilon$ in that sequence.\n\n\n\nThen $f\\left(X_{\\epsilon} B_{1}\\right)$ is not $B_{1}$, so must be the other point of intersection of $X_{\\epsilon} B_{1}$ with $g\\left(B_{1}\\right)$, and the same applies with $B_{2}$. Now consider the three points $X_{\\epsilon}, f\\left(X_{\\epsilon} B_{1}\\right)$ and $f\\left(X_{\\epsilon} B_{2}\\right)$. As $\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0$, the angle at $X_{\\epsilon}$ tends to $\\angle B_{1} A B_{2}$ or $180^{\\circ}-\\angle B_{1} A B_{2}$, which is not 0 or $180^{\\circ}$ because no three of the points were collinear. All three distances between those points are bounded above by constant multiples of $\\epsilon$ (in fact, if the triangle is scaled by a factor of $1 / \\epsilon$, it tends to a fixed triangle). Thus the circumradius of those three points, which is the radius of $g\\left(X_{\\epsilon}\\right)$, is also bounded above by a constant multiple of $\\epsilon$, and so the result follows by Lemma 2 .\n\nLemma 5. Suppose there are two points $A$ and $B$ such that $g(A)$ and $g(B)$ cut. Then there is a point $P$ with the given property.\n\nProof. Suppose that $g(A)$ and $g(B)$ cut at $C$ and $D$. One of those points, without loss of generality $C$, must be $f(A B)$, and so lie on the line $A B$. We now consider two cases, according to whether $D$ also lies on that line.\n\nCase 1: D does not lie on that line:\n\nIn this case, consider a sequence of $X_{\\epsilon}$ at distance $\\epsilon$ from $D$, tending to $D$ along some line that is not a tangent to either circle, but perturbed slightly (by at most $\\epsilon^{2}$ ) to ensure that no three of the points $A, B$ and $X_{\\epsilon}$ are collinear and no four are concyclic.\n\nConsider the points $f\\left(X_{\\epsilon} A\\right)$ and $f\\left(X_{\\epsilon} B\\right)$, and the circles $g\\left(X_{\\epsilon}\\right)$ on which they lie. The point $f\\left(X_{\\epsilon} A\\right)$ might be either $A$ or the other intersection of $X_{\\epsilon} A$ with the circle $g(A)$, and the same applies for $B$. If, for some sequence of $\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0$, both those points are the other point of intersection, the same argument as in the proof of Lemma 4 applies to find arbitrarily small circles. Otherwise, we have either infinitely many of those circles passing through $A$, or infinitely many passing through $B$; without loss of generality, suppose infinitely many through $A$.\n\nWe now show we can find five points $B_{i}$ satisfying the conditions of Lemma 4 (together with $A$ ). Let $B_{1}$ be any of the $X_{\\epsilon}$ for which $g\\left(X_{\\epsilon}\\right)$ passes through $A$. Then repeat the following four times, for $2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant 5$.\n\nConsider some line $\\ell=X_{\\epsilon} A$ (different from those considered for previous $i$ ) that is not tangent to any of the $g\\left(B_{j}\\right)$ for $j<i$, and is such that $f(\\ell)=A$, so $g(Y)$ passes through $A$ for all $Y$ on that line. If there are arbitrarily small circles $g(Y)$ we are done by Lemma 2, so the radii of such circles must be bounded below. But as $Y \\rightarrow A$, along any line not tangent to $g\\left(B_{j}\\right)$, the radius of a circle through $Y$ and tangent to $g\\left(B_{j}\\right)$ at $A$ tends to 0 . So there must be some $Y$ such that $g(Y)$ cuts $g\\left(B_{j}\\right)$ at $A$ rather than being tangent to it there, for all of the previous $B_{j}$, and we may also pick it such that no three of the $B_{i}$ and $A$ are collinear and no four are concyclic. Let $B_{i}$ be this $Y$. Now the result follows by Lemma 4 .\n\nCase 2: D does lie on that line:\n\nIn this case, we follow a similar argument, but the sequence of $X_{\\epsilon}$ needs to be slightly different. $C$ and $D$ both lie on the line $A B$, so one must be $A$ and the other must be $B$. Consider a sequence of $X_{\\epsilon}$ tending to $B$. Rather than tending to $B$ along a straight line (with small perturbations), let the sequence be such that all the points are inside the two circles, with the angle between $X_{\\epsilon} B$ and the tangent to $g(B)$ at $B$ tending to 0 .\n\nAgain consider the points $f\\left(X_{\\epsilon} A\\right)$ and $f\\left(X_{\\epsilon} B\\right)$. If, for some sequence of $\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0$, both those points are the other point of intersection with the respective circles, we see that the angle at $X_{\\epsilon}$ tends to the angle between $A B$ and the tangent to $g(B)$ at $B$, which is not 0 or $180^{\\circ}$, while the distances tend to 0 (although possibly slower than any multiple of $\\epsilon$ ), so we have arbitrarily small circumradii and the result follows by Lemma 2. Otherwise, we have either infinitely many of the circles $g\\left(X_{\\epsilon}\\right)$ passing through $A$, or infinitely many passing through $B$, and the same argument as in the previous case enables us to reduce to Lemma 4.\n\nLemmas 3 and 5 together cover all cases, and so the required result is proved.'
 'For any point $X$, denote by $t(X)$ the line tangent to $g(X)$ at $X$; notice that $f(t(X))=X$, so $f$ is surjective.\n\nStep 1: We find a point $P$ for which there are at least two different lines $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ such that $f\\left(p_{i}\\right)=P$.\n\nChoose any point $X$.

Consider one of them. Let $X$ vary on $\\ell$. Then $R_{1}$ is the projection of $X$ to $p_{1}$ via $R_{2}, S_{1}$ is the projection of $R_{1}$ to $g(Q)$ via $Q$. Finally, $\\angle\\left(Q S_{1}, S_{1} X\\right)=\\angle\\left(R_{1} S_{1}, S_{1} X\\right)=$ $\\angle\\left(R_{1} P, P X\\right)=\\angle\\left(p_{1}, \\ell\\right) \\neq 0$, so $X$ is obtained by a fixed projective transform $g(Q) \\rightarrow \\ell$ from $S_{1}$. So, if there were three points $X$ satisfying the conditions of this subcase, the composition of the three projective transforms would be the identity. But, if we apply it to $X=Q$, we successively get some point $R_{1}^{\\prime}$, then $R_{2}$, and then some point different from $Q$, a contradiction.\n\nThus Case 2.2 also occurs for only finitely many points $X$, as desired.\n\nStep 3: We show that $f(P Q)=P$, as desired.\n\nThe argument is similar to that in Step 2, with the roles of $Q$ and $X$ swapped. Again, we show that there are only finitely many possible positions for a point $X \\in \\ell \\backslash\\{P, Q\\}$, which is absurd.\n\nCase 3.1: $t(Q)$ is parallel to one of the $p_{i}$; say, to $p_{1}$.\n\nLet $t(Q) \\operatorname{cross} p_{2}$ at $R$; then $g(R)$ is the circle $(P R Q)$. Let $R X$ cross $g(R)$ again at $S$. Then $f(R X) \\in\\{R, S\\} \\cap g(X)$, so $g(X)$ contains one of the points $R$ and $S$.\n\n<img_4051>\n\nSubcase 3.1.1: $S=f(R X) \\in g(X)$.\n\nWe have $\\angle(t(X), Q X)=\\angle(S X, S Q)=\\angle(S R, S Q)=\\angle(P R, P Q)=\\angle\\left(p_{2}, \\ell\\right)$. Hence $t(X) \\| p_{2}$. Now we recall Case 2.1: we let $t(X)$ cross $p_{1}$ at $R^{\\prime}$, so $g\\left(R^{\\prime}\\right)=\\left(P R^{\\prime} X\\right)$, and let $R^{\\prime} Q$ meet $g\\left(R^{\\prime}\\right)$ again at $S^{\\prime}$; notice that $S^{\\prime} \\neq Q$. Excluding one position of $X$, we may assume that $R^{\\prime} \\notin g(Q)$, so $R^{\\prime} \\neq f\\left(R^{\\prime} Q\\right)$. Therefore, $S^{\\prime}=f\\left(R^{\\prime} Q\\right) \\in g(Q)$. But then, as in Case 2.1, we get $\\angle(t(Q), P Q)=\\angle\\left(Q S^{\\prime}, S^{\\prime} P\\right)=\\angle\\left(R^{\\prime} X, X P\\right)=\\angle\\left(p_{2}, \\ell\\right)$. This means that $t(Q)$ is parallel to $p_{2}$, which is impossible.\n\nSubcase 3.1.2: $R=f(R X) \\in g(X)$.\n\nIn this case, we have $\\angle(t(X), \\ell)=\\angle(R X, R Q)=\\angle\\left(R X, p_{1}\\right)$. Again, let $R^{\\prime}=t(X) \\cap p_{1}$; this point exists for all but at most one position of $X$. Then $g\\left(R^{\\prime}\\right)=\\left(R^{\\prime} X P\\right)$; let $R^{\\prime} Q$ meet $g\\left(R^{\\prime}\\right)$ again at $S^{\\prime}$. Due to $\\angle\\left(R^{\\prime} X, X R\\right)=\\angle(Q X, Q R)=\\angle\\left(\\ell, p_{1}\\right), R^{\\prime}$ determines $X$ in at most two ways, so for all but finitely many positions of $X$ we have $R^{\\prime} \\notin g(Q)$. Therefore, for those positions we have $S^{\\prime}=f\\left(R^{\\prime} Q\\right) \\in g(Q)$. But then $\\angle\\left(R X, p_{1}\\right)=\\angle\\left(R^{\\prime} X, X P\\right)=\\angle\\left(R^{\\prime} S^{\\prime}, S^{\\prime} P\\right)=$ $\\angle\\left(Q S^{\\prime}, S^{\\prime} P\\right)=\\angle(t(Q), Q P)$ is fixed, so this case can hold only for one specific position of $X$ as well.\n\nThus, in Case 3.1, there are only finitely many possible positions of $X$, yielding a contradiction.\n\n\n\nCase 3.2: $t(Q)$ crosses $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$ at $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$, respectively.\n\nBy Step $2, R_{1} \\neq R_{2}$. Notice that $g\\left(R_{i}\\right)$ is the circle $\\left(P Q R_{i}\\right)$. Let $R_{i} X$ meet $g\\left(R_{i}\\right)$ at $S_{i}$; then $S_{i} \\neq X$.

Since $p \\leqslant b$, one of the terms of the numerator $a n(a n-1) \\cdots(a n-b+1)$ is $a n-p+1$, which is divisible by $p^{t+1}$. Hence the $p$-adic valuation of the numerator is at least $t+1$, but that of the denominator is exactly $t$.

 ""We show only half of the claim of the previous solution: we show that if $b$ is $a$-good, then $p \\mid a$ for all primes $p \\leqslant b$.

Then consider the expansion of $b$ in base $p$; there will be some digit (not the final digit) which is nonzero, because $p \\leqslant b$. Suppose it is the $p^{t}$ digit for $t \\geqslant 1$.\n\nNow, as $n$ varies over the integers, $a n+1$ runs over all residue classes modulo $p^{t+1}$; in particular, there is a choice of $n$ (with $a n>b$ ) such that the $p^{0}$ digit of an is $p-1$ (so $p \\mid a n+1)$ and the $p^{t}$ digit of an is 0 . Consequently, $p \\mid a n+1$ but $p \\mid\\left(\\begin{array}{c}a n \\\\ b\\end{array}\\right)$ (by Lucas' theorem) so $p \\nmid\\left(\\begin{array}{c}a n \\\\ b\\end{array}\\right)-1$. Thus $b$ is not $a$-good.\n\nNow we show directly that if $b$ is $a$-good but $b+2$ fails to be so, then there must be a prime dividing $a n+1$ for some $n$, which also divides $(b+1)(b+2)$. Indeed, the ratio between $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}a n \\\\ b+2\\end{array}\\right)$ and $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}a n \\\\ b\\end{array}\\right)$ is $(b+1)(b+2) /(a n-b)(a n-b-1)$.

- **Number of terms threshold**: The threshold is defined as \(c n \log n\), which depends on both \(c\) and \(n\).
- **Representation method**: Numbers are expressed as sums of pairwise coprime \(n^{\text{th}}\) powers, where the coprimality is pairwise between the powers.
- **Asymptotic property**: For infinitely many \(n\), there exist infinitely many numbers requiring at least the threshold number of terms.
- **Theme**: The core theme revolves around additive representation theory with constraints, particularly the sparsity and coprimality of higher powers affecting representation efficiency.

### Step 2
**#Plan#:**
- **Change proof to computation**: Instead of proving existence of \(c\), transform the problem into computing a specific numerical value—the supremum of all possible constants \(c\) for which the property holds, as this is a key unknown and requires complex optimization.
- **Quantify ""infinitely many numbers""**: Replace the qualitative ""infinitely many"" with a quantitative lower bound (e.g., at least \(X^{0.6}\) numbers up to \(X\)) to require explicit enumeration and density analysis, adding computational complexity through explicit bounds and exponents.
- **Add a new constraint**: Enhance the representation method by requiring that all pairwise coprime \(n^{\text{th}}\) powers have prime bases (i.e., each term is \(p^n\) for a prime \(p\)). This introduces deeper number-theoretic challenges tied to prime distributions and primality constraints.
- **Ensure coherence**: Set \(X\) to depend crucially on \(n\) as \(X = \exp(n (\log n)^2)\), making the bound tight and the dependency non-trivial, ensuring all modified elements interconnect logically (c through sup, bounds through exponent optimization, and prime bases through added constraints).
- **Focus on difficulty**: The computational task of finding the supremum \(c\) involves intricate balances between \(c\), \(n\), the exponent in the lower bound, and primality, making it harder than the proof while yielding a specific answer.

### Step 3
**#Rewritten Instruction#:**
Compute the supremum of all constants \(c > 0\) such that there exist infinitely many positive integers \(n\) for which the number of integers between 1 and \(\exp(n (\log n)^2)\) that cannot be expressed as the sum of fewer than \(c n \log n\) pairwise coprime \(n^{\text{th}}\) powers of prime numbers is at least \(\exp(n (\log n)^{0.6})\).

Thus $\\operatorname{deg} F \\geqslant n$.\n\nThe lemma condition yields that $\\Sigma_{F}(x)=T(x) G(x)$ for some polynomial $G(x)$ such that $\\operatorname{deg} G=\\operatorname{deg} \\Sigma_{F}-(n+1)=\\operatorname{deg} F-n$.\n\nNow, let us define $F_{1}(x)=T(x) G(x)-T(x-1) G(x-1)$. Then for every positive integer $n$ we have\n\n$$\n\\Sigma_{F_{1}}(n)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(T(x) G(x)-T(x-1) G(x-1))=T(n) G(n)-T(0) G(0)=T(n) G(n)=\\Sigma_{F}(n),\n$$\n\nso the polynomial $\\Sigma_{F-F_{1}}(x)=\\Sigma_{F}(x)-\\Sigma_{F_{1}}(x)$ has infinitely many roots. This means that this polynomial is zero, which in turn yields $F(x)=F_{1}(x)$, as required.\n\n\n\nFirst, we apply the lemma to the nonzero polynomial $R_{1}(x)=P(x)-Q(x)$. Since the degree of $R_{1}(x)$ is at most $n$, we conclude that it is exactly $n$. Moreover, $R_{1}(x)=\\alpha \\cdot(T(x)-T(x-1))$ for some nonzero constant $\\alpha$.\n\nOur next aim is to prove that the polynomial $S(x)=P(x)+Q(x)$ is constant. Assume the contrary. Then, notice that the polynomial $R_{2}(x)=P(x)^{2}-Q(x)^{2}=R_{1}(x) S(x)$ is also nonzero and satisfies the lemma condition. Since $n<\\operatorname{deg} R_{1}+\\operatorname{deg} S=\\operatorname{deg} R_{2} \\leqslant 2 n$, the lemma yields\n\n$$\nR_{2}(x)=T(x) G(x)-T(x-1) G(x-1)\n$$\n\nwith some polynomial $G(x)$ with $0<\\operatorname{deg} G \\leqslant n$.\n\nSince the polynomial $R_{1}(x)=\\alpha(T(x)-T(x-1))$ divides the polynomial\n\n$$\nR_{2}(x)=T(x)(G(x)-G(x-1))+G(x-1)(T(x)-T(x-1)),\n$$\n\nwe get $R_{1}(x) \\mid T(x)(G(x)-G(x-1))$. On the other hand,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(T(x), R_{1}(x)\\right)=\\operatorname{gcd}(T(x), T(x)-T(x-1))=\\operatorname{gcd}(T(x), T(x-1))=1\n$$\n\nsince both $T(x)$ and $T(x-1)$ are the products of linear polynomials, and their roots are distinct. Thus $R_{1}(x) \\mid G(x)-G(x-1)$. However, this is impossible since $G(x)-G(x-1)$ is a nonzero polynomial of degree less than $n=\\operatorname{deg} R_{1}$.\n\nThus, our assumption is wrong, and $S(x)$ is a constant polynomial, say $S(x)=\\beta$. Notice that the polynomials $(2 P(x)-\\beta) / \\alpha$ and $(2 Q(x)-\\beta) / \\alpha$ are also block-similar and distinct. So we may replace the initial polynomials by these ones, thus obtaining two block-similar polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ with $P(x)=-Q(x)=T(x)-T(x-1)$. It remains to show that this is impossible.\n\nFor every $i=1,2 \\ldots, n$, the values $T(i k-k+1)$ and $T(i k-1)$ have the same sign. This means that the values $P(i k-k+1)=T(i k-k+1)$ and $P(i k)=-T(i k-1)$ have opposite signs, so $P(x)$ has a root in each of the $n$ segments $[i k-k+1, i k]$. Since $\\operatorname{deg} P=n$, it must have exactly one root in each of them.\n\nThus, the sequence $P(1), P(2), \\ldots, P(k)$ should change sign exactly once. On the other hand, since $P(x)$ and $-P(x)$ are block-similar, this sequence must have as many positive terms as negative ones. Since $k=2 \\ell+1$ is odd, this shows that the middle term of the sequence above must be zero, so $P(\\ell+1)=0$, or $T(\\ell+1)=T(\\ell)$. However, this is not true since\n\n$$\n|T(\\ell+1)|=|\\ell+1| \\cdot|\\ell| \\cdot \\prod_{i=2}^{n}|\\ell+1-i k|<|\\ell| \\cdot|\\ell+1| \\cdot \\prod_{i=2}^{n}|\\ell-i k|=|T(\\ell)|\n$$\n\nwhere the strict inequality holds because $n \\geqslant 2$. We come to the final contradiction.'
 'Assume again that there exist two distinct block-similar polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ of degree $n$. Let $R(x)=P(x)-Q(x)$ and $S(x)=P(x)+Q(x)$. For brevity, we also denote the segment $[(i-1) k+1, i k]$ by $I_{i}$, and the set $\\{(i-1) k+1,(i-1) k+2, \\ldots, i k\\}$ of all integer points in $I_{i}$ by $Z_{i}$.\n\nStep 1. We prove that $R(x)$ has exactly one root in each segment $I_{i}, i=1,2, \\ldots, n$, and all these roots are simple.\n\nIndeed, take any $i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ and choose some points $p^{-}, p^{+} \\in Z_{i}$ so that\n\n$$\nP\\left(p^{-}\\right)=\\min _{x \\in Z_{i}} P(x) \\text { and } \\quad P\\left(p^{+}\\right)=\\max _{x \\in Z_{i}} P(x) \\text {. }\n$$\n\nSince the sequences of values of $P$ and $Q$ in $Z_{i}$ are permutations of each other, we have $R\\left(p^{-}\\right)=P\\left(p^{-}\\right)-Q\\left(p^{-}\\right) \\leqslant 0$ and $R\\left(p^{+}\\right)=P\\left(p^{+}\\right)-Q\\left(p^{+}\\right) \\geqslant 0$. Since $R(x)$ is continuous, there exists at least one root of $R(x)$ between $p^{-}$and $p^{+}$- thus in $I_{i}$.\n\nSo, $R(x)$ has at least one root in each of the $n$ disjoint segments $I_{i}$ with $i=1,2, \\ldots, n$. Since $R(x)$ is nonzero and its degree does not exceed $n$, it should have exactly one root in each of these segments, and all these roots are simple, as required.\n\nStep 2. We prove that $S(x)$ is constant. \n\nWe start with the following claim.\n\nClaim. For every $i=1,2, \\ldots, n$, the sequence of values $S((i-1) k+1), S((i-1) k+2), \\ldots$, $S(i k)$ cannot be strictly increasing.\n\nProof. Fix any $i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$. Due to the symmetry, we may assume that $P(i k) \\leqslant Q(i k)$. Choose now $p^{-}$and $p^{+}$as in Step 1. If we had $P\\left(p^{+}\\right)=P\\left(p^{-}\\right)$, then $P$ would be constant on $Z_{i}$, so all the elements of $Z_{i}$ would be the roots of $R(x)$, which is not the case. In particular, we have $p^{+} \\neq p^{-}$. If $p^{-}>p^{+}$, then $S\\left(p^{-}\\right)=P\\left(p^{-}\\right)+Q\\left(p^{-}\\right) \\leqslant Q\\left(p^{+}\\right)+P\\left(p^{+}\\right)=S\\left(p^{+}\\right)$, so our claim holds.\n\nWe now show that the remaining case $p^{-}<p^{+}$is impossible. Assume first that $P\\left(p^{+}\\right)>$ $Q\\left(p^{+}\\right)$. Then, like in Step 1 , we have $R\\left(p^{-}\\right) \\leqslant 0, R\\left(p^{+}\\right)>0$, and $R(i k) \\leqslant 0$, so $R(x)$ has a root in each of the intervals $\\left[p^{-}, p^{+}\\right)$and $\\left(p^{+}, i k\\right]$. This contradicts the result of Step 1.\n\nWe are left only with the case $p^{-}<p^{+}$and $P\\left(p^{+}\\right)=Q\\left(p^{+}\\right)$(thus $p^{+}$is the unique root of $R(x)$ in $\\left.I_{i}\\right)$. If $p^{+}=i k$, then the values of $R(x)$ on $Z_{i} \\backslash\\{i k\\}$ are all of the same sign, which is absurd since their sum is zero. Finally, if $p^{-}<p^{+}<i k$, then $R\\left(p^{-}\\right)$and $R(i k)$ are both negative. This means that $R(x)$ should have an even number of roots in $\\left[p^{-}, i k\\right]$, counted with multiplicity. This also contradicts the result of Step 1.\n\nIn a similar way, one may prove that for every $i=1,2, \\ldots, n$, the sequence $S((i-1) k+1)$, $S((i-1) k+2), \\ldots, S(i k)$ cannot be strictly decreasing. This means that the polynomial $\\Delta S(x)=S(x)-S(x-1)$ attains at least one nonnegative value, as well as at least one nonpositive value, on the set $Z_{i}$ (and even on $Z_{i} \\backslash\\{(i-1) k+1\\}$ ); so $\\Delta S$ has a root in $I_{i}$.\n\nThus $\\Delta S$ has at least $n$ roots; however, its degree is less than $n$, so $\\Delta S$ should be identically zero. This shows that $S(x)$ is a constant, say $S(x) \\equiv \\beta$.\n\nStep 3. Notice that the polynomials $P(x)-\\beta / 2$ and $Q(x)-\\beta / 2$ are also block-similar and distinct. So we may replace the initial polynomials by these ones, thus reaching $P(x)=-Q(x)$.\n\nThen $R(x)=2 P(x)$, so $P(x)$ has exactly one root in each of the segments $I_{i}, i=1,2, \\ldots, n$. On the other hand, $P(x)$ and $-P(x)$ should attain the same number of positive values on $Z_{i}$. Since $k$ is odd, this means that $Z_{i}$ contains exactly one root of $P(x)$; moreover, this root should be at the center of $Z_{i}$, because $P(x)$ has the same number of positive and negative values on $Z_{i}$.\n\nThus we have found all $n$ roots of $P(x)$, so\n\n$$\nP(x)=c \\prod_{i=1}^{n}(x-i k+\\ell) \\quad \\text { for some } c \\in \\mathbb{R} \\backslash\\{0\\}\n$$\n\n\n\nwhere $\\ell=(k-1) / 2$. It remains to notice that for every $t \\in Z_{1} \\backslash\\{1\\}$ we have\n\n$$\n|P(t)|=|c| \\cdot|t-\\ell-1| \\cdot \\prod_{i=2}^{n}|t-i k+\\ell|<|c| \\cdot \\ell \\cdot \\prod_{i=2}^{n}|1-i k+\\ell|=|P(1)|\n$$\n\nso $P(1) \\neq-P(t)$ for all $t \\in Z_{1}$. This shows that $P(x)$ is not block-similar to $-P(x)$. The final contradiction.']"
1944,"In Lineland there are $n \geqslant 1$ towns, arranged along a road running from left to right. Each town has a left bulldozer (put to the left of the town and facing left) and a right bulldozer (put to the right of the town and facing right). The sizes of the $2 n$ bulldozers are distinct. Every time when a right and a left bulldozer confront each other, the larger bulldozer pushes the smaller one off the road. On the other hand, the bulldozers are quite unprotected at their rears; so, if a bulldozer reaches the rear-end of another one, the first one pushes the second one off the road, regardless of their sizes.

#Elements Identified#:
- Towns: $n \geq 1$ arranged linearly left to right.
- Bulldozers: Each town has left (facing left) and right (facing right) bulldozer; all $2n$ sizes distinct.
- Actions: Confrontation (facing, size-based push) or rear-end (unfacing, size-ignored push) when bulldozers interact.
- Sweep away: Town $A$ sweeps $B$ if $A$'s right bulldozer moves to $B$ pushing off all encountered bulldozers (symmetrically for $B$ sweeping $A$).
- Property: Exactly one town cannot be swept away by any other.
- Core structure: Linear sequence with size-dependent interactions.

#Plan#:
- Increase complexity by adding randomness through random size assignments, enabling probability computation.
- Introduce position dependence by setting towns at arbitrary positions $x_1 < x_2 < \dots < x_n$, adding spatial variability.
- Add a computational task involving combinatorics: Count the number of size permutations where town $k$ is the unique unsweepable town, for given $n, k$.

The base case $n=1$ is trivial.\n\nFor the induction step, we first observe that the left bulldozer in $T_{1}$ and the right bulldozer in $T_{n}$ are completely useless, so we may forget them forever.

Let $T_{m}$ be some town to the left of $T_{k}$. By the choice of $T_{k}$, town $T_{m}$ can be swept away from the right by some town $T_{p}$ with $p>m$. As we have already observed, $p$ cannot be greater than $k$. On the other hand, $T_{m}$ cannot sweep $T_{p}$ away, so a fortiori it cannot sweep $T_{k}$ away.\n\nClaim 2. Any town $T_{m}$ with $m \\neq k$ can be swept away by some other town.\n\n\n\nProof. If $m<k$, then $T_{m}$ can be swept away from the right due to the choice of $T_{k}$.

Now we claim that for every $k=1,2, \\ldots$, the town $t_{k+1}$ is to the right of $t_{k}$; this leads to the contradiction, since the number of towns is finite.\n\nInduction on $k$. The base case $k=1$ is clear due to the choice of $t_{1}$. Assume now that for all $j$ with $1 \\leqslant j<k$, the town $t_{j+1}$ is to the right of $t_{j}$. Suppose that $t_{k+1}$ is situated to the left of $t_{k}$; then it lies between $t_{j}$ and $t_{j+1}$ (possibly coinciding with $t_{j}$ ) for some $j<k$. Therefore, $t_{k+1}$ can be swept away by $t_{j+1}$, which shows that it cannot sweep $t_{j+1}$ away - so $t_{k+1}$ also cannot sweep $t_{k}$ away.

There are some positive integers, such as 1 , that receive no arrows; these will be referred to as starting points in the sequel. When one starts at any of the starting points and keeps following the arrows, one is led to an infinite path, called its ray, that visits a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers. Since the length of any arrow is at most 2015, such a ray, say with starting point $s$, meets every interval of the form $[n, n+2014]$ with $n \\geqslant s$ at least once.\n\nSuppose for the sake of contradiction that there would be at least 2016 starting points. Then we could take an integer $n$ that is larger than the first 2016 starting points. But now the interval $[n, n+2014]$ must be met by at least 2016 rays in distinct points, which is absurd.

#Elements Identified#:  
- **Set S**: A nonempty set of positive integers, can be specified to a particular sequence.  
- **Clean definition**: n has a unique representation as a sum with an odd number of distinct elements from S.  
- **Proof requirement**: Show infinitely many non-clean n for any S.  
- **Theme**: Uniqueness in subset sums with a parity constraint; depends on S's structure.  

Key elements to manipulate: Type of set S (e.g., change from any set to a complex sequence), task (from proof to computation), output (introduce specific numerical computation), and constraints (add dependencies like modular arithmetic).  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
1. **Change S to a specific complex sequence**: Replace the arbitrary set with the Fibonacci sequence (defined to avoid duplicates: F₁=1, F₂=2, and Fₖ = Fₖ₋₁ + Fₖ₋₂ for k≥3). This introduces dependencies enabling multiple subset representations, increasing algorithmic difficulty.  
2. **Modify task from proof to computational count**: Instead of proving infinitude, for large N (e.g., N=10⁶), compute the number of non-clean n ≤ N, which requires efficient methods (e.g., dynamic programming).  
3. **Add complexity with modular constraint**: Demand the answer modulo 10⁹+7 to enforce handling of large integers and combine with number theory, preventing brute force.  
4. **Justify interconnected complexity**: Fibonacci ensures inherent redundancies, N large for computational hardness, modulo for efficiency; transformed into a nontrivial problem needing optimization. Avoids simplification; consistent theme of parity-unique subset sums.

Let $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ denote the set of all positive integers.\n\nSuppose, to the contrary, that there exist only finitely many positive integers that are not clean. Therefore, there exists a positive integer $N$ such that every integer $n>N$ has exactly one odd representation.\n\nClearly, $S$ is infinite. We now claim the following properties of odd and even representations.\n\nProperty 1. Any positive integer $n$ has at most one odd and at most one even representation. Proof. We first show that every integer $n$ has at most one even representation. Since $S$ is infinite, there exists $x \\in S$ such that $x>\\max \\{n, N\\}$. Then, the number $n+x$ must be clean, and $x$ does not appear in any even representation of $n$. If $n$ has more than one even representation, then we obtain two distinct odd representations of $n+x$ by adding $x$ to the even representations of $n$, which is impossible. Therefore, $n$ can have at most one even representation.\n\nSimilarly, there exist two distinct elements $y, z \\in S$ such that $y, z>\\max \\{n, N\\}$. If $n$ has more than one odd representation, then we obtain two distinct odd representations of $n+y+z$ by adding $y$ and $z$ to the odd representations of $n$. This is again a contradiction.\n\nProperty 2. Fix $s \\in S$. Suppose that a number $n>N$ has no even representation. Then $n+2$ as has an even representation containing $s$ for all integers $a \\geqslant 1$.\n\nProof. It is sufficient to prove the following statement: If $n$ has no even representation without $s$, then $n+2 s$ has an even representation containing $s$ (and hence no even representation without $s$ by Property 1).\n\nNotice that the odd representation of $n+s$ does not contain $s$; otherwise, we have an even representation of $n$ without $s$. Then, adding $s$ to this odd representation of $n+s$, we get that $n+2 s$ has an even representation containing $s$, as desired.\n\nProperty 3. Every sufficiently large integer has an even representation.\n\nProof. Fix any $s \\in S$, and let $r$ be an arbitrary element in $\\{1,2, \\ldots, 2 s\\}$. Then, Property 2 implies that the set $Z_{r}=\\{r+2 a s: a \\geqslant 0\\}$ contains at most one number exceeding $N$ with no even representation. Therefore, $Z_{r}$ contains finitely many positive integers with no even representation, and so does $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}=\\bigcup_{r=1}^{2 s} Z_{r}$.\n\nIn view of Properties 1 and 3, we may assume that $N$ is chosen such that every $n>N$ has exactly one odd and exactly one even representation. In particular, each element $s>N$ of $S$ has an even representation.\n\nProperty 4. For any $s, t \\in S$ with $N<s<t$, the even representation of $t$ contains $s$.\n\nProof. Suppose the contrary. Then, $s+t$ has at least two odd representations: one obtained by adding $s$ to the even representation of $t$ and one obtained by adding $t$ to the even representation of $s$. Since the latter does not contain $s$, these two odd representations of $s+t$ are distinct, a contradiction.\n\nLet $s_{1}<s_{2}<\\cdots$ be all the elements of $S$, and set $\\sigma_{n}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} s_{i}$ for each nonnegative integer $n$. Fix an integer $k$ such that $s_{k}>N$. Then, Property 4 implies that for every $i>k$ the even representation of $s_{i}$ contains all the numbers $s_{k}, s_{k+1}, \\ldots, s_{i-1}$. Therefore,\n\n$$\ns_{i}=s_{k}+s_{k+1}+\\cdots+s_{i-1}+R_{i}=\\sigma_{i-1}-\\sigma_{k-1}+R_{i},\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nwhere $R_{i}$ is a sum of some of $s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{k-1}$. In particular, $0 \\leqslant R_{i} \\leqslant s_{1}+\\cdots+s_{k-1}=\\sigma_{k-1}$.\n\n\n\nLet $j_{0}$ be an integer satisfying $j_{0}>k$ and $\\sigma_{j_{0}}>2 \\sigma_{k-1}$. Then (1) shows that, for every $j>j_{0}$,\n\n$$\ns_{j+1} \\geqslant \\sigma_{j}-\\sigma_{k-1}>\\sigma_{j} / 2\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nNext, let $p>j_{0}$ be an index such that $R_{p}=\\min _{i>j_{0}} R_{i}$.

It follows that the even representation $\\tau$ of $2 s_{p}$ does not contain any element larger than $s_{p}$. On the other hand, inequality (2) yields $2 s_{p}>s_{1}+\\cdots+s_{p-1}$, so $\\tau$ must contain a term larger than $s_{p-1}$. Thus, it must contain $s_{p}$. After removing $s_{p}$ from $\\tau$, we have that $s_{p}$ has an odd representation not containing $s_{p}$, which contradicts Property 1 since $s_{p}$ itself also forms an odd representation of $s_{p}$.']"

#Elements Identified#:  
- **Key Entities**: Company of people (vertices), enemy relations (edges), unsociable groups (odd-sized subsets with at least 3 members inducing a Hamiltonian subgraph), constraint on the number of unsociable groups (≤2015), partition into fixed parts (11) with no enemies in the same part.  
- **Actions/Processes**: Proof that under the constraint, such a partition exists; unsociable groups require an odd cyclic arrangement with neigbors as enemies.  
- **Theme**: Graph theory, focusing on Hamiltonian subsets, constraints, and vertex coloring to avoid conflicting edges.  
- **Modifiable Elements**: Numbers (2015, 11), constraint type (e.g., from ""at most"" to ""exactly""), problem type (proof to computation), additional constraints (e.g., specific group sizes, additional graph properties), computational output (e.g., chromatic number, size of partition under min/max).  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
1. **Change problem type**: Transform the proof question into a computational question demanding a specific numerical answer, focusing on the minimum chromatic number in an extreme case.  
2. **Modify constraints**:  
   - Replace ""at most 2015"" with ""exactly k"" for complexity, but set k=2015 to reflect the original bound.  
   - Introduce a new dependency: The graph's girth must be at least 5 (to ensure no small cycles, affecting unsociable group formation).  
   - Add a size constraint: Each unsociable group must have at least 5 members (increasing difficulty by focusing on larger groups).  
3. **Increase complexity**:  
   - Instead of existence of partition, compute the minimum possible number of parts (chromatic number) for a specific graph size (n=2015 vertices).  
   - Incorporate girth constraint to force dependence on Hamiltonian cycles, aligning with the unsociable group definition and making computation non‑trivial.  
   - Requirements: For n=2015 vertices, exactly m=2015 unsociable groups (one per ""suspected"" set), girth at least 5, and each unsociable group size ≥5; compute min χ(G).  
   - Justification: Forces handling of sparse graphs with many large odd Hamiltonian-based subsets, eliminating small cycles; requires combinatorial Hamiltonian existence proofs or constructions for the answer.  
4. **Ensure coherence**: Variables and constraints (n, m, girth, group size) are interlinked—girth affects Hamiltonianicity, group size ensures non-trivial sets, and n=m ties to the original 2015. The answer involves chromatic number computation for a hard case.

Let $G$ be a graph with chromatic number $k \\geqslant 3$. Then $G$ contains at least $2^{k-1}-k$ unsociable groups.\n\nRecall that the chromatic number of $G$ is the least $k$ such that a proper coloring\n\n$$\nV=V_{1} \\sqcup \\cdots \\sqcup V_{k}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nexists. In view of $2^{11}-12>2015$, the claim implies the problem statement.\n\nLet $G$ be a graph with chromatic number $k$. We say that a proper coloring (1) of $G$ is leximinimal, if the $k$-tuple $\\left(\\left|V_{1}\\right|,\\left|V_{2}\\right|, \\ldots,\\left|V_{k}\\right|\\right)$ is lexicographically minimal; in other words, the following conditions are satisfied: the number $n_{1}=\\left|V_{1}\\right|$ is minimal; the number $n_{2}=\\left|V_{2}\\right|$ is minimal, subject to the previously chosen value of $n_{1} ; \\ldots$; the number $n_{k-1}=\\left|V_{k-1}\\right|$ is minimal, subject to the previously chosen values of $n_{1}, \\ldots, n_{k-2}$.\n\nThe following lemma is the core of the proof.\n\nLemma 1. Suppose that $G=(V, E)$ is a graph with odd chromatic number $k \\geqslant 3$, and let (1) be one of its leximinimal colorings. Then $G$ contains an odd cycle which visits all color classes $V_{1}, V_{2}, \\ldots, V_{k}$.\n\nProof of Lemma 1. Let us call a cycle colorful if it visits all color classes.\n\nDue to the definition of the chromatic number, $V_{1}$ is nonempty. Choose an arbitrary vertex $v \\in V_{1}$. We construct a colorful odd cycle that has only one vertex in $V_{1}$, and this vertex is $v$.\n\nWe draw a subgraph of $G$ as follows. Place $v$ in the center, and arrange the sets $V_{2}, V_{3}, \\ldots, V_{k}$ in counterclockwise circular order around it. For convenience, let $V_{k+1}=V_{2}$. We will draw arrows to add direction to some edges of $G$, and mark the vertices these arrows point to. First we draw arrows from $v$ to all its neighbors in $V_{2}$, and mark all those neighbors. If some vertex $u \\in V_{i}$ with $i \\in\\{2,3, \\ldots, k\\}$ is already marked, we draw arrows from $u$ to all its neighbors in $V_{i+1}$ which are not marked yet, and we mark all of them. We proceed doing this as long as it is possible. The process of marking is exemplified in Figure 1.\n\nNotice that by the rules of our process, in the final state, marked vertices in $V_{i}$ cannot have unmarked neighbors in $V_{i+1}$. Moreover, $v$ is connected to all marked vertices by directed paths.\n\nNow move each marked vertex to the next color class in circular order (see an example in Figure 3). In view of the arguments above, the obtained coloring $V_{1} \\sqcup W_{2} \\sqcup \\cdots \\sqcup W_{k}$ is proper. Notice that $v$ has a neighbor $w \\in W_{2}$, because otherwise\n\n$$\n\\left(V_{1} \\backslash\\{v\\}\\right) \\sqcup\\left(W_{2} \\cup\\{v\\}\\right) \\sqcup W_{3} \\sqcup \\cdots \\sqcup W_{k}\n$$\n\nwould be a proper coloring lexicographically smaller than (1). If $w$ was unmarked, i.e., $w$ was an element of $V_{2}$, then it would be marked at the beginning of the process and thus moved to $V_{3}$, which did not happen. Therefore, $w$ is marked and $w \\in V_{k}$.\n\n\n\n<img_3364>\n\nFigure 1\n\n<img_3603>\n\nFigure 2\n\nSince $w$ is marked, there exists a directed path from $v$ to $w$. This path moves through the sets $V_{2}, \\ldots, V_{k}$ in circular order, so the number of edges in it is divisible by $k-1$ and thus even. Closing this path by the edge $w \\rightarrow v$, we get a colorful odd cycle, as required.\n\nProof of the claim. Let us choose a leximinimal coloring (1) of $G$. For every set $C \\subseteq\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$ such that $|C|$ is odd and greater than 1 , we will provide an odd cycle visiting exactly those color classes whose indices are listed in the set $C$. This property ensures that we have different cycles for different choices of $C$, and it proves the claim because there are $2^{k-1}-k$ choices for the set $C$.\n\nLet $V_{C}=\\bigcup_{c \\in C} V_{c}$, and let $G_{C}$ be the induced subgraph of $G$ on the vertex set $V_{C}$. We also have the induced coloring of $V_{C}$ with $|C|$ colors; this coloring is of course proper. Notice further that the induced coloring is leximinimal: if we had a lexicographically smaller coloring $\\left(W_{c}\\right)_{c \\in C}$ of $G_{C}$, then these classes, together the original color classes $V_{i}$ for $i \\notin C$, would provide a proper coloring which is lexicographically smaller than (1). Hence Lemma 1, applied to the subgraph $G_{C}$ and its leximinimal coloring $\\left(V_{c}\\right)_{c \\in C}$, provides an odd cycle that visits exactly those color classes that are listed in the set $C$.'
 ""We say that a graph is critical if deleting any vertex from the graph decreases the graph's chromatic number. Obviously every graph contains a critical induced subgraph with the same chromatic number.\n\nLemma 2. Suppose that $G=(V, E)$ is a critical graph with chromatic number $k \\geqslant 3$. Then every vertex $v$ of $G$ is contained in at least $2^{k-2}-1$ unsociable groups.\n\nProof. For every set $X \\subseteq V$, denote by $n(X)$ the number of neighbors of $v$ in the set $X$.\n\nSince $G$ is critical, there exists a proper coloring of $G \\backslash\\{v\\}$ with $k-1$ colors, so there exists a proper coloring $V=V_{1} \\sqcup V_{2} \\sqcup \\cdots \\sqcup V_{k}$ of $G$ such that $V_{1}=\\{v\\}$. Among such colorings, take one for which the sequence $\\left(n\\left(V_{2}\\right), n\\left(V_{3}\\right), \\ldots, n\\left(V_{k}\\right)\\right)$ is lexicographically minimal. Clearly, $n\\left(V_{i}\\right)>0$ for every $i=2,3, \\ldots, k$; otherwise $V_{2} \\sqcup \\ldots \\sqcup V_{i-1} \\sqcup\\left(V_{i} \\cup V_{1}\\right) \\sqcup V_{i+1} \\sqcup \\ldots V_{k}$ would be a proper coloring of $G$ with $k-1$ colors.\n\nWe claim that for every $C \\subseteq\\{2,3, \\ldots, k\\}$ with $|C| \\geqslant 2$ being even, $G$ contains an unsociable group so that the set of its members' colors is precisely $C \\cup\\{1\\}$. Since the number of such sets $C$ is $2^{k-2}-1$, this proves the lemma. Denote the elements of $C$ by $c_{1}, \\ldots, c_{2 \\ell}$ in increasing order. For brevity, let $U_{i}=V_{c_{i}}$. Denote by $N_{i}$ the set of neighbors of $v$ in $U_{i}$.\n\n\n\nWe show that for every $i=1, \\ldots, 2 \\ell-1$ and $x \\in N_{i}$, the subgraph induced by $U_{i} \\cup U_{i+1}$ contains a path that connects $x$ with another point in $N_{i+1}$. For the sake of contradiction, suppose that no such path exists. Let $S$ be the set of vertices that lie in the connected component of $x$ in the subgraph induced by $U_{i} \\cup U_{i+1}$, and let $P=U_{i} \\cap S$, and $Q=U_{i+1} \\cap S$ (see Figure 3). Since $x$ is separated from $N_{i+1}$, the sets $Q$ and $N_{i+1}$ are disjoint. So, if we re-color $G$ by replacing $U_{i}$ and $U_{i+1}$ by $\\left(U_{i} \\cup Q\\right) \\backslash P$ and $\\left(U_{i+1} \\cup P\\right) \\backslash Q$, respectively, we obtain a proper coloring such that $n\\left(U_{i}\\right)=n\\left(V_{c_{i}}\\right)$ is decreased and only $n\\left(U_{i+1}\\right)=n\\left(V_{c_{i+1}}\\right)$ is increased. That contradicts the lexicographical minimality of $\\left(n\\left(V_{2}\\right), n\\left(V_{3}\\right), \\ldots, n\\left(V_{k}\\right)\\right)$.\n\n<img_3732>\n\nFigure 3\n\nNext, we build a path through $U_{1}, U_{2}, \\ldots, U_{2 \\ell}$ as follows. Let the starting point of the path be an arbitrary vertex $v_{1}$ in the set $N_{1}$. For $i \\leqslant 2 \\ell-1$, if the vertex $v_{i} \\in N_{i}$ is already defined, connect $v_{i}$ to some vertex in $N_{i+1}$ in the subgraph induced by $U_{i} \\cup U_{i+1}$, and add these edges to the path. Denote the new endpoint of the path by $v_{i+1}$; by the construction we have $v_{i+1} \\in N_{i+1}$ again, so the process can be continued. At the end we have a path that starts at $v_{1} \\in N_{1}$ and ends at some $v_{2 \\ell} \\in N_{2 \\ell}$. Moreover, all edges in this path connect vertices in neighboring classes: if a vertex of the path lies in $U_{i}$, then the next vertex lies in $U_{i+1}$ or $U_{i-1}$. Notice that the path is not necessary simple, so take a minimal subpath of it. The minimal subpath is simple and connects the same endpoints $v_{1}$ and $v_{2 \\ell}$. The property that every edge steps to a neighboring color class (i.e., from $U_{i}$ to $U_{i+1}$ or $U_{i-1}$ ) is preserved. So the resulting path also visits all of $U_{1}, \\ldots, U_{2 \\ell}$, and its length must be odd. Closing the path with the edges $v v_{1}$ and $v_{2 \\ell} v$ we obtain the desired odd cycle (see Figure 4).\n\n<img_3665>\n\nFigure 4\n\nNow we prove the claim by induction on $k \\geqslant 3$. The base case $k=3$ holds by applying Lemma 2 to a critical subgraph. For the induction step, let $G_{0}$ be a critical $k$-chromatic subgraph of $G$, and let $v$ be an arbitrary vertex of $G_{0}$. By Lemma $2, G_{0}$ has at least $2^{k-2}-1$ unsociable groups containing $v$. On the other hand, the graph $G_{0} \\backslash\\{v\\}$ has chromatic number $k-1$, so it contains at least $2^{k-2}-(k-1)$ unsociable groups by the induction hypothesis. Altogether, this gives $2^{k-2}-1+2^{k-2}-(k-1)=2^{k-1}-k$ distinct unsociable groups in $G_{0}$ (and thus in $G)$.""]"

- Points \(Q\) and \(K\) on \(\Gamma\) defined by \(\angle AQH = 90^{\circ}\) and \(\angle QKH = 90^{\circ}\) respectively.

#Plan#:
- Replace the general triangle with a specific acute triangle having sides \(AB = 13\), \(AC = 12\), \(BC = 7\) to enable computation and ensure \(AB > AC\).
- Change the proof task to a computational problem: compute the length of the common external tangent segment between the circumcircles of \(KQH\) and \(KFM\).
- Add concrete steps to find \(Q\) and \(K\) explicitly: first find \(Q\) on \(\Gamma\) with \(\angle AQH = 90^{\circ}\), then find \(K\) on \(\Gamma\) with \(\angle QKH = 90^{\circ}\) for that \(Q\).

- Key properties: All triangles share identical area \(A = \frac{\text{total area}}{\text{n-2}}\). Multiple Thaiangulations exist for \(n \geq 4\), connected via flip operations.
- Proof logic: Any two Thaiangulations are mutually reachable by a sequence of single-flip steps, each replacing two triangles.
- Complexity levers: Polygon vertex count (\(n\)), vertex coordinates (enabling irregular shapes with asymmetric area constraints), flip-step aggregation (computing distance in Thaiangulation graph), combinatorial optimization (minimal flip count).

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. **Increase dimensionality**: Specify a large \(n\) (ex: \(n = 100\)) to force scale-intensive computation, avoiding simplistic case analysis.  
2. **Introduce real-world constraint**: Use a fixed irregular convex polygon with coordinates requiring area calculations (with decimals/irrationals). Compute \(\text{total area}/(n-2)\) to validate Thaiangulations.  
3. **Demand combinatorial complexity**: Require computation of the *maximal minimal flip distance* – i.e., the diameter of the Thaiangulation flip graph – forcing optimization over all Thaiangulation pairs.  
4. **Strengthen dependency**: Outcomes depend on polygon shape and area constraints, with the answer uniquely determined by \(n\) due to the associahedron's combinatorial structure when Thaiangulations are dense.  
5. **Retain core theme**: Equal-area triangles and flip operations remain central, with Thaiangulations forming a connected graph.

Step 3
#Rewritten Instruction#:
Given an irregular convex 100-gon with vertices at coordinates \((\sin(2\pi k/100), \cos^2(2\pi k/100))\) for \(k = 0,\dots,99\), verify that Thaiangulations exist and compute the largest possible minimum number of flip operations needed to transform between any pair of distinct Thaiangulations.

Step 4
#Finally Rewritten Instruction#:
For the convex 100-gon defined by vertices \((\sin(2\pi k/100), \cos^2(2\pi k/100))\) where \(k \in \{0,1,\ldots,99\}\), compute the maximum, over all pairs of its distinct Thaiangulations, of the minimum number of flip operations required to transform one into the other.  
Provide the numerical result.",success,71.51,"['We denote by $[S]$ the area of a polygon $S$.\n\nRecall that each triangulation of a convex $n$-gon has exactly $n-2$ triangles. This means that all triangles in any two Thaiangulations of a convex polygon $\\Pi$ have the same area.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{T}$ be a triangulation of a convex polygon $\\Pi$. If four vertices $A, B, C$, and $D$ of $\\Pi$ form a parallelogram, and $\\mathcal{T}$ contains two triangles whose union is this parallelogram, then we say that $\\mathcal{T}$ contains parallelogram $A B C D$. Notice here that if two Thaiangulations $\\mathcal{T}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$ of $\\Pi$ differ by two triangles, then the union of these triangles is a quadrilateral each of whose diagonals bisects its area, i.e., a parallelogram.\n\nWe start with proving two properties of triangulations.\n\nLemma 1. A triangulation of a convex polygon $\\Pi$ cannot contain two parallelograms.\n\nProof. Arguing indirectly, assume that $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ are two parallelograms contained in some triangulation $\\mathcal{T}$. If they have a common triangle in $\\mathcal{T}$, then we may assume that $P_{1}$ consists of triangles $A B C$ and $A D C$ of $\\mathcal{T}$, while $P_{2}$ consists of triangles $A D C$ and $C D E$ (see Figure 1). But then $B C\\|A D\\| C E$, so the three vertices $B, C$, and $E$ of $\\Pi$ are collinear, which is absurd.\n\nAssume now that $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ contain no common triangle. Let $P_{1}=A B C D$. The sides $A B$, $B C, C D$, and $D A$ partition $\\Pi$ into several parts, and $P_{2}$ is contained in one of them; we may assume that this part is cut off from $P_{1}$ by $A D$. Then one may label the vertices of $P_{2}$ by $X$, $Y, Z$, and $T$ so that the polygon $A B C D X Y Z T$ is convex (see Figure 2; it may happen that $D=X$ and/or $T=A$, but still this polygon has at least six vertices). But the sum of the external angles of this polygon at $B, C, Y$, and $Z$ is already $360^{\\circ}$, which is impossible. A final contradiction.\n\n<img_3466>\n\nFigure 1\n\n<img_3722>\n\nFigure 2\n\n<img_3376>\n\nFigure 3\n\nLemma 2. Every triangle in a Thaiangulation $\\mathcal{T}$ of $\\Pi$ contains a side of $\\Pi$.\n\nProof. Let $A B C$ be a triangle in $\\mathcal{T}$. Apply an affine transform such that $A B C$ maps to an equilateral triangle; let $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}$ be the image of this triangle, and $\\Pi^{\\prime}$ be the image of $\\Pi$. Clearly, $\\mathcal{T}$ maps into a Thaiangulation $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$ of $\\Pi^{\\prime}$.\n\nAssume that none of the sides of $\\triangle A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}$ is a side of $\\Pi^{\\prime}$. Then $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$ contains some other triangles with these sides, say, $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} Z, C^{\\prime} A^{\\prime} Y$, and $B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime} X$; notice that $A^{\\prime} Z B^{\\prime} X C^{\\prime} Y$ is a convex hexagon (see Figure 3). The sum of its external angles at $X, Y$, and $Z$ is less than $360^{\\circ}$. So one of these angles (say, at $Z$ ) is less than $120^{\\circ}$, hence $\\angle A^{\\prime} Z B^{\\prime}>60^{\\circ}$. Then $Z$ lies on a circular arc subtended by $A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime}$ and having angular measure less than $240^{\\circ}$; consequently, the altitude $Z H$ of $\\triangle A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} Z$ is less than $\\sqrt{3} A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} / 2$. Thus $\\left[A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} Z\\right]<\\left[A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C^{\\prime}\\right]$, and $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$ is not a Thaiangulation. A contradiction.\n\n\n\nNow we pass to the solution. We say that a triangle in a triangulation of $\\Pi$ is an ear if it contains two sides of $\\Pi$. Note that each triangulation of a polygon contains some ear.\n\nArguing indirectly, we choose a convex polygon $\\Pi$ with the least possible number of sides such that some two Thaiangulations $\\mathcal{T}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$ of $\\Pi$ violate the problem statement (thus $\\Pi$ has at least five sides). Consider now any ear $A B C$ in $\\mathcal{T}_{1}$, with $A C$ being a diagonal of $\\Pi$. If $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$ also contains $\\triangle A B C$, then one may cut $\\triangle A B C$ off from $\\Pi$, getting a polygon with a smaller number of sides which also violates the problem statement. This is impossible; thus $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$ does not contain $\\triangle A B C$.\n\nNext, $\\mathcal{T}_{1}$ contains also another triangle with side $A C$, say $\\triangle A C D$. By Lemma 2, this triangle contains a side of $\\Pi$, so $D$ is adjacent to either $A$ or $C$ on the boundary of $\\Pi$. We may assume that $D$ is adjacent to $C$.\n\nAssume that $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$ does not contain the triangle $B C D$. Then it contains two different triangles $B C X$ and $C D Y$ (possibly, with $X=Y$ ); since these triangles have no common interior points, the polygon $A B C D Y X$ is convex (see Figure 4). But, since $[A B C]=[B C X]=$ $[A C D]=[C D Y]$, we get $A X \\| B C$ and $A Y \\| C D$ which is impossible. Thus $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$ contains $\\triangle B C D$.\n\nTherefore, $[A B D]=[A B C]+[A C D]-[B C D]=[A B C]$, and $A B C D$ is a parallelogram contained in $\\mathcal{T}_{1}$. Let $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$ be the Thaiangulation of $\\Pi$ obtained from $\\mathcal{T}_{1}$ by replacing the diagonal $A C$ with $B D$; then $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$ is distinct from $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$ (otherwise $\\mathcal{T}_{1}$ and $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$ would differ by two triangles). Moreover, $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$ shares a common ear $B C D$ with $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$. As above, cutting this ear away we obtain that $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$ and $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$ differ by two triangles forming a parallelogram different from $A B C D$. Thus $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$ contains two parallelograms, which contradicts Lemma 1.\n\n<img_3479>\n\nFigure 4\n\n<img_3850>\n\nFigure 5']"

 'Claim 1. The sequence $\\left(w_{n}\\right)$ is non-increasing.\n\nProof. If $a_{n} \\mid b_{n}$ then $a_{n+1}=a_{n}+1$. Due to $a_{n} \\mid s_{n}$, we have $a_{n} \\notin W_{n}$. Moreover $s_{n+1}=s_{n}$; therefore, $W_{n+1}=W_{n}$ and $w_{n+1}=w_{n}$.\n\nOtherwise, if $a_{n} \\nmid b_{n}$, then $a_{n} \\nmid s_{n}$, so $a_{n} \\in W_{n}$ and thus $w_{n}=a_{n}$. We show that $a_{n} \\in W_{n+1}$; this implies $w_{n+1} \\leqslant a_{n}=w_{n}$. By the definition of $W_{n+1}$, we need that $a_{n} \\geqslant a_{n+1}$ and $a_{n} \\nmid s_{n+1}$. The first relation holds because of $\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(a_{n}, b_{n}\\right)<a_{n}$. For the second relation, observe that in $s_{n+1}=\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(a_{n}, b_{n}\\right)+\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(a_{n}, b_{n}\\right)$, the second term is divisible by $a_{n}$, but the first term is not. So $a_{n} \\nmid s_{n+1}$; that completes the proof of the claim.\n\nLet $w=\\min _{n} w_{n}$ and let $N$ be an index with $w=w_{N}$. Due to Claim 1, we have $w_{n}=w$ for all $n \\geqslant N$.\n\nLet $g_{n}=\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(w, s_{n}\\right)$.

Let $r_{n}$ be the remainder of $b_{n}$, divided by $M$. For every index $n$, since $a_{n}|M| b_{n}-r_{n}$, we have $\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(a_{n}, b_{n}\\right)=\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(a_{n}, r_{n}\\right)$, and therefore\n\n$$\na_{n+1}=\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(a_{n}, r_{n}\\right)+1 \\text {. }\n$$\n\nMoreover,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nr_{n+1} & \\equiv b_{n+1}=\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(a_{n}, b_{n}\\right)-1=\\frac{a_{n}}{\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(a_{n}, b_{n}\\right)} b_{n}-1 \\\\\n& =\\frac{a_{n}}{\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(a_{n}, r_{n}\\right)} b_{n}-1 \\equiv \\frac{a_{n}}{\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(a_{n}, r_{n}\\right)} r_{n}-1 \\quad(\\bmod M) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\n\nHence, the pair $\\left(a_{n}, r_{n}\\right)$ uniquely determines the pair $\\left(a_{n+1}, r_{n+1}\\right)$.

In the first of them, we show that the function $f$ is injective and explain how this leads to a useful visualization of $f$. Then comes the second step, in which most of the work happens: its goal is to show that for any $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ the sequence $n, f(n), f^{2}(n), \\ldots$ is an arithmetic progression. Finally, in the third step we put everything together, thus solving the problem.\n\nStep 1. We commence by checking that $f$ is injective. For this purpose, we consider any $m, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with $f(m)=f(k)$. By $(i)$, every positive integer $n$ has the property that\n\n$$\n\\frac{k-m}{n}=\\frac{f^{n}(m)-m}{n}-\\frac{f^{n}(k)-k}{n}\n$$\n\nis a difference of two integers and thus integral as well. But for $n=|k-m|+1$ this is only possible if $k=m$. Thereby, the injectivity of $f$ is established.\n\nNow recall that due to condition $(i i)$ there are finitely many positive integers $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{k}$ such that $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ is the disjoint union of $\\left\\{a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{k}\\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{f(n) \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\\right\\}$. Notice that by plugging $n=1$ into condition $(i)$ we get $f(m)>m$ for all $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$.\n\nWe contend that every positive integer $n$ may be expressed uniquely in the form $n=f^{j}\\left(a_{i}\\right)$ for some $j \\geqslant 0$ and $i \\in\\{1, \\ldots, k\\}$. The uniqueness follows from the injectivity of $f$. The existence can be proved by induction on $n$ in the following way. If $n \\in\\left\\{a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{k}\\right\\}$, then we may take $j=0$; otherwise there is some $n^{\\prime}<n$ with $f\\left(n^{\\prime}\\right)=n$ to which the induction hypothesis may be applied.\n\nThe result of the previous paragraph means that every positive integer appears exactly once in the following infinite picture, henceforth referred to as ""the Table"":\n\n| $a_{1}$ | $f\\left(a_{1}\\right)$ | $f^{2}\\left(a_{1}\\right)$ | $f^{3}\\left(a_{1}\\right)$ | $\\ldots$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $a_{2}$ | $f\\left(a_{2}\\right)$ | $f^{2}\\left(a_{2}\\right)$ | $f^{3}\\left(a_{2}\\right)$ | $\\ldots$ |\n| $\\vdots$ | $\\vdots$ | $\\vdots$ | $\\vdots$ |  |\n| $a_{k}$ | $f\\left(a_{k}\\right)$ | $f^{2}\\left(a_{k}\\right)$ | $f^{3}\\left(a_{k}\\right)$ | $\\ldots$ |\n\nThe Table\n\nStep 2. Our next goal is to prove that each row of the Table is an arithmetic progression. Assume contrariwise that the number $t$ of rows which are arithmetic progressions would satisfy $0 \\leqslant t<k$. By permuting the rows if necessary we may suppose that precisely the first $t$ rows are arithmetic progressions, say with steps $T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{t}$. Our plan is to find a further row that is ""not too sparse"" in an asymptotic sense, and then to prove that such a row has to be an arithmetic progression as well.\n\nLet us write $T=\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(T_{1}, T_{2}, \\ldots, T_{t}\\right)$ and $A=\\max \\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{t}\\right\\}$ if $t>0$; and $T=1$ and $A=0$ if $t=0$. For every integer $n \\geqslant A$, the interval $\\Delta_{n}=[n+1, n+T]$ contains exactly $T / T_{i}$\n\n\n\nelements of the $i^{\\text {th }}$ row $(1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant t)$. Therefore, the number of elements from the last $(k-t)$ rows of the Table contained in $\\Delta_{n}$ does not depend on $n \\geqslant A$. It is not possible that none of these intervals $\\Delta_{n}$ contains an element from the $k-t$ last rows, because infinitely many numbers appear in these rows. It follows that for each $n \\geqslant A$ the interval $\\Delta_{n}$ contains at least one member from these rows.\n\nThis yields that for every positive integer $d$, the interval $[A+1, A+(d+1)(k-t) T]$ contains at least $(d+1)(k-t)$ elements from the last $k-t$ rows; therefore, there exists an index $x$ with $t+1 \\leqslant x \\leqslant k$, possibly depending on $d$, such that our interval contains at least $d+1$ elements from the $x^{\\text {th }}$ row. In this situation we have\n\n$$\nf^{d}\\left(a_{x}\\right) \\leqslant A+(d+1)(k-t) T .\n$$\n\nFinally, since there are finitely many possibilities for $x$, there exists an index $x \\geqslant t+1$ such that the set\n\n$$\nX=\\left\\{d \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\mid f^{d}\\left(a_{x}\\right) \\leqslant A+(d+1)(k-t) T\\right\\}\n$$\n\nis infinite. Thereby we have found the ""dense row"" promised above.\n\nBy assumption $(i)$, for every $d \\in X$ the number\n\n$$\n\\beta_{d}=\\frac{f^{d}\\left(a_{x}\\right)-a_{x}}{d}\n$$\n\nis a positive integer not exceeding\n\n$$\n\\frac{A+(d+1)(k-t) T}{d} \\leqslant \\frac{A d+2 d(k-t) T}{d}=A+2(k-t) T\n$$\n\nThis leaves us with finitely many choices for $\\beta_{d}$, which means that there exists a number $T_{x}$ such that the set\n\n$$\nY=\\left\\{d \\in X \\mid \\beta_{d}=T_{x}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nis infinite. Notice that we have $f^{d}\\left(a_{x}\\right)=a_{x}+d \\cdot T_{x}$ for all $d \\in Y$.\n\nNow we are prepared to prove that the numbers in the $x^{\\text {th }}$ row form an arithmetic progression, thus coming to a contradiction with our assumption. Let us fix any positive integer $j$. Since the set $Y$ is infinite, we can choose a number $y \\in Y$ such that $y-j>\\left|f^{j}\\left(a_{x}\\right)-\\left(a_{x}+j T_{x}\\right)\\right|$. Notice that both numbers\n\n$$\nf^{y}\\left(a_{x}\\right)-f^{j}\\left(a_{x}\\right)=f^{y-j}\\left(f^{j}\\left(a_{x}\\right)\\right)-f^{j}\\left(a_{x}\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad f^{y}\\left(a_{x}\\right)-\\left(a_{x}+j T_{x}\\right)=(y-j) T_{x}\n$$\n\nare divisible by $y-j$. Thus, the difference between these numbers is also divisible by $y-j$. Since the absolute value of this difference is less than $y-j$, it has to vanish, so we get $f^{j}\\left(a_{x}\\right)=$ $a_{x}+j \\cdot T_{x}$.\n\nHence, it is indeed true that all rows of the Table are arithmetic progressions.\n\nStep 3. Keeping the above notation in force, we denote the step of the $i^{\\text {th }}$ row of the table by $T_{i}$.\n\n<img_3584>\n\n$$\nT=\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(T_{1}, \\ldots, T_{k}\\right)\n$$\n\nTo see this, let any $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ be given and denote the index of the row in which it appears in the Table by $i$. Then we have $f^{j}(n)=n+j \\cdot T_{i}$ for all $j \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$, and thus indeed\n\n$$\nf(n+T)-f(n)=f^{1+T / T_{i}}(n)-f(n)=\\left(n+T+T_{i}\\right)-\\left(n+T_{i}\\right)=T .\n$$\n\nThis concludes the solution.']"

1972,Let $n$ points be given inside a rectangle $R$ such that no two of them lie on a line parallel to one of the sides of $R$. The rectangle $R$ is to be dissected into smaller rectangles with sides parallel to the sides of $R$ in such a way that none of these rectangles contains any of the given points in its interior. Prove that we have to dissect $R$ into at least $n+1$ smaller rectangles.,"Inside rectangle R, place n points such that no two share the same horizontal or vertical line and k fixed, non-overlapping, axis-aligned rectangular obstructions, with points not on obstruction edges. The obstructions occupy a k×k grid region centrally within R, with spacing matching obstruction widths, while points densely ring this outer obstruction perimeter. Determine numerically the smallest possible number of axis-aligned rectangles dissecting R without crossing obstruction interiors or containing any point internally.","Step 1
#Elements Identified#:
*   Rectangle R
*   n points inside R, satisfying the ""no two collinear vertically or horizontally"" condition
*   Dissection into smaller axis-aligned rectangles
*   Constraint: No smaller rectangle contains a point in its interior
*   Goal: Prove a lower bound on the number of smaller rectangles (n+1)
*   Structure: Proof task

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Change Goal:** Replace the proof task requiring a single minimum lower bound with the computational task of **finding an exact, specific minimum number** of rectangles needed for a much harder scenario.
2.  **Add Significant Complexity Factor:** Introduce `k` **fixed, non-overlapping, axis-aligned rectangular obstructions** inside R. The dissection lines **cannot cross the interiors of these obstructions** (i.e., lines stop at obstruction boundaries). Points are not on obstruction boundaries. These obstacles drastically alter the necessary dissection pattern.
3.  **Introduce Computationally Challenging Arrangement:** Instead of unrestricted points, constrain the n points and k obstructions to create a **specific complex spatial dependency** affecting the minimum dissection count.
4.  **Require Computation:** Ask for the exact, minimal number of smaller rectangles required for a concrete input size (large n, k) involving the complex arrangement. The value must be computed based on the interactions between points, obstructions, and the necessary dissection lines.
5.  **Preserve Core Constraints:** Keep the initial point placement constraint and the requirement that no sub-rectangle contains a point in its interior.

Step 3
#Rewritten Instruction#:
Given a rectangle R, place n points and k axis-aligned, non-overlapping rectangular obstructions within R such that no two points are horizontally or vertically aligned, and no point lies on an obstruction boundary. Dissection lines must avoid obstruction interiors. The obstacles and points form a well-defined central obstruction pattern surrounded by points at minimal distances. Compute the minimal number of smaller rectangles needed to dissect R into axis-aligned rectangles not containing any point internally or crossing any obstruction interior.

Step 4
#Finally Rewritten Instruction#:
Inside rectangle R, place n points such that no two share the same horizontal or vertical line and k fixed, non-overlapping, axis-aligned rectangular obstructions, with points not on obstruction edges. The obstructions occupy a k×k grid region centrally within R, with spacing matching obstruction widths, while points densely ring this outer obstruction perimeter. Determine numerically the smallest possible number of axis-aligned rectangles dissecting R without crossing obstruction interiors or containing any point internally.",success,24.08,"['Let $k$ be the number of rectangles in the dissection. The set of all points that are corners of one of the rectangles can be divided into three disjoint subsets:\n\n- $A$, which consists of the four corners of the original rectangle $R$, each of which is the corner of exactly one of the smaller rectangles,\n- $B$, which contains points where exactly two of the rectangles have a common corner (T-junctions, see the figure below),\n- $C$, which contains points where four of the rectangles have a common corner (crossings, see the figure below).\n<img_3599>\n\nFigure 1: A T-junction and a crossing\n\nWe denote the number of points in $B$ by $b$ and the number of points in $C$ by $c$. Since each of the $k$ rectangles has exactly four corners, we get\n\n$$\n4 k=4+2 b+4 c\n$$\n\nIt follows that $2 b \\leqslant 4 k-4$, so $b \\leqslant 2 k-2$.\n\nEach of the $n$ given points has to lie on a side of one of the smaller rectangles (but not of the original rectangle $R$ ). If we extend this side as far as possible along borders between rectangles, we obtain a line segment whose ends are T-junctions. Note that every point in $B$ can only be an endpoint of at most one such segment containing one of the given points, since it is stated that no two of them lie on a common line parallel to the sides of $R$. This means that\n\n$$\nb \\geqslant 2 n \\text {. }\n$$\n\nCombining our two inequalities for $b$, we get\n\n$$\n2 k-2 \\geqslant b \\geqslant 2 n\n$$\n\nthus $k \\geqslant n+1$, which is what we wanted to prove.'
 ""Let $k$ denote the number of rectangles. In the following, we refer to the directions of the sides of $R$ as 'horizontal' and 'vertical' respectively. Our goal is to prove the inequality $k \\geqslant n+1$ for fixed $n$. Equivalently, we can prove the inequality $n \\leqslant k-1$ for each $k$, which will be done by induction on $k$. For $k=1$, the statement is trivial.\n\nNow assume that $k>1$. If none of the line segments that form the borders between the rectangles is horizontal, then we have $k-1$ vertical segments dividing $R$ into $k$ rectangles. On each of them, there can only be one of the $n$ points, so $n \\leqslant k-1$, which is exactly what we want to prove.\n\nOtherwise, consider the lowest horizontal line $h$ that contains one or more of these line segments. Let $R^{\\prime}$ be the rectangle that results when everything that lies below $h$ is removed from $R$ (see the example in the figure below).\n\nThe rectangles that lie entirely below $h$ form blocks of rectangles separated by vertical line segments. Suppose there are $r$ blocks and $k_{i}$ rectangles in the $i^{\\text {th }}$ block. The left and right border of each block has to extend further upwards beyond $h$. Thus we can move any points that lie on these borders upwards, so that they now lie inside $R^{\\prime}$. This can be done without violating the conditions, one only needs to make sure that they do not get to lie on a common horizontal line with one of the other given points.\n\nAll other borders between rectangles in the $i^{\\text {th }}$ block have to lie entirely below $h$. There are $k_{i}-1$ such line segments, each of which can contain at most one of the given points. Finally, there can be one point that lies on $h$. All other points have to lie in $R^{\\prime}$ (after moving some of them as explained in the previous paragraph).\n\n<img_3717>\n\nFigure 2: Illustration of the inductive argument\n\nWe see that $R^{\\prime}$ is divided into $k-\\sum_{i=1}^{r} k_{i}$ rectangles. Applying the induction hypothesis to $R^{\\prime}$, we find that there are at most\n\n$$\n\\left(k-\\sum_{i=1}^{r} k_{i}\\right)-1+\\sum_{i=1}^{r}\\left(k_{i}-1\\right)+1=k-r\n$$\n\npoints. Since $r \\geqslant 1$, this means that $n \\leqslant k-1$, which completes our induction.""]"
