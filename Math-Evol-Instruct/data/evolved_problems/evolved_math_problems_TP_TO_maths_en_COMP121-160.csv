- Conditions: Fixed sum $\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 1$, inequality to prove for arbitrary $n$.

- Participants: Terms $a_k$ are independent, allowing arbitrary sequences satisfying sum constraint.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. **Add chain constraint**: Replace independent $a_i$ with a parameterized deterministic sequence $a_k = \frac{a_1}{c^{k-1}}$ where $c > 0$ is a parameter. This introduces functional dependencies between variables.
2. **Concretize n and ask for a specific computation**: Fix $n=100$ to necessitate computation for large $n$, and require finding the exact *maximum value* of the sum over the parameter $c$ (optimization), forcing numerical analysis or symbolic simplification.
3. **Minimize over initial conditions**: Add minimization of $a_1$ subject to the sum constraint, introducing min-max optimization and two-variable interdependence.

*   Theme: Combinatorial constraints on subset sums forcing a minimum set size.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Add Constraint/Randomness:** Introduce an element of randomness by making each element in $A$ positive *or negative* with equal probability (50%) when initially generated, but its inclusion in any subset sum carries its signed value. This significantly increases the combinatorial difficulty by invalidating the simple Pigeonhole Principle applied to *values*.
2.  **Change Objective:** Instead of proving a minimum size exists, require finding the maximum *probability* that, given the random signs of elements, there *exists* a set $A$ of size $n$ satisfying the subset sum conditions.
3.  **Introduce Dependency & Output:** Turn the problem into computing a specific numerical value: this maximum probability as a function of $n$ and $m$. Specifically, ask for this probability when $n$ is exactly $\lfloor m/2 \rfloor$. This transforms a size-bound proof into a precise probability calculation.
4.  **Maintain Core:** Keep the requirement for subsets $B_i$ summing to distinct powers $m^1$ to $m^m$.

Compute the minimal total weight over all minimal blocking sets.","### Step 1
#Elements Identified#:
- **Grid size**: $3m \times 3m$ where $m$ is an integer greater than 1.
- **Key points**: Start cell $S$ (lower-left corner), end cell $F$ (upper-right corner).
- **Movement constraints**: Frog can only move right or up.
- **Sticky cells and blocking**: Sticky cells trap the frog; a set $X$ is blocking if it prevents reaching $F$ from $S$; $X$ is minimal if no proper subset is blocking.
- **Bound**: Original proof task shows every minimal blocking set has at most $3m^2$ cells.
- **Theme**: Combinatorics, grid paths, optimization, and minimal sets in graph theory.

### Step 2
#Plan#:
1. **Transform proof to computation**: Instead of proving the bound, make the problem ask for the exact maximum size of a minimal blocking set as a specific computational output for given $m$.
2. **Increase complexity via weights**: Introduce cell weights based on Manhattan distance from $S$ (i.e., $w(i,j) = i + j - 2$ for cell $(i,j)$, with row $i$ from bottom to top and column $j$ from left to right, $S$ at $(1,1)$). This adds an optimization layer.
3. **Add dependency and hardness**: Ask for the minimal possible total weight among all minimal blocking sets (not restricted by size). This requires optimizing a functional over abstract set structures, combining vertex cover-like reasoning with geometric weights.
4. **Ensure logical connection**: Weights depend on grid position, introducing real-world constraints (distance-based cost) and linking to spatial optimization. The computation becomes non-trivial due to minimality over varying set sizes and weights.

Consider a $3m \times 3m$ grid for integer $m > 1$, with $S$ at $(1,1)$ and $F$ at $(3m, 3m)$. A frog can only hop right or up. Cells are sticky; a blocking set $X$ prevents reaching $F$ from $S$, and minimal means no proper subset is blocking. Each cell $(i,j)$ has weight $w(i,j) = i + j - 2$. Find the minimum possible total weight of any minimal blocking set.

Compute the minimal total weight over all minimal blocking sets.",success,154.6,"['For a given blocking set $X$, say that a non-sticky cell is red if the frog can reach it from $S$ via some hops without entering set $X$. We call a non-sticky cell blue if the frog can reach $F$ from that cell via hops without entering set $X$. One can regard the blue cells as those reachable from $F$ by anti-hops, i.e. moves downwards and to the left. We also colour all cells in $X$ green. It follows from the definition of the blocking set that no cell will be coloured twice. In Figure 2 we show a sample of a blocking set and the corresponding colouring.\n\nNow assume that $X$ is a minimal blocking set. We denote by $R$ (resp., $B$ and $G$ ) be the total number of red (resp., blue and green) cells.\n\nWe claim that $G \\leqslant R+1$ and $G \\leqslant B+1$. Indeed, there are at most $2 R$ possible frog hops from red cells. Every green or red cell (except for $S$ ) is accessible by such hops. Hence $2 R \\geqslant G+(R-1)$, or equivalently $G \\leqslant R+1$. In order to prove the inequality $G \\leqslant B+1$, we turn over the board and apply the similar arguments.\n\nTherefore we get $9 m^{2} \\geqslant B+R+G \\geqslant 3 G-2$, so $G \\leqslant 3 m^{2}$.\n\n\n\n<img_3633>\n\nFigure 2 (a)\n\n<img_3800>\n\nFigure 2 (b)'
 'We shall use the same colouring as in the above solution. Again, assume that $X$ is a minimal blocking set.\n\nNote that any $2 \\times 2$ square cannot contain more than 2 green cells. Indeed, on Figure 3(a) the cell marked with ""?"" does not block any path, while on Figure 3(b) the cell marked with ""?"" should be coloured red and blue simultaneously. So we can split all green cells into chains consisting of three types of links shown on Figure 4 (diagonal link in the other direction is not allowed, corresponding green cells must belong to different chains). For example, there are 3 chains in Figure 2(b).\n\n<img_3801>\nFigure 3\n\n\n<img_3377>\n\nand\n\n<img_3940>\nFigure 4\n\n<img_3548>\n\nand\n\n<img_3741>\n\nFigure 5\n\nWe will inscribe green chains in disjoint axis-aligned rectangles so that the number of green cells in each rectangle will not exceed $1 / 3$ of the area of the rectangle. This will give us the bound $G \\leqslant 3 m^{2}$. Sometimes the rectangle will be the minimal bounding rectangle of the chain, sometimes minimal bounding rectangles will be expanded in one or two directions in order to have sufficiently large area.\n\nNote that for any two consecutive cells in the chain the colouring of some neighbouring cells is uniquely defined (see Figure 5). In particular, this observation gives a corresponding rectangle for the chains of height (or width) 1 (see Figure 6(a)). A separate green cell can be inscribed in $1 \\times 3$ or $3 \\times 1$ rectangle with one red and one blue cell, see Figure $6(\\mathrm{~b})-(\\mathrm{c})$, otherwise we get one of impossible configurations shown in Figure 3.\n\n<img_3511>\n\n$(a)$\n\n<img_3415>\n\n(b)\n\n<img_3727>\n\n$(c)$\n\nFigure 6\n\n<img_3401>\n\n(a)\n\n<img_3913>\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7\n\nAny diagonal chain of length 2 is always inscribed in a $2 \\times 3$ or $3 \\times 2$ rectangle without another green cells. Indeed, one of the squares marked with ""?"" in Figure 7(a) must be red. If it is the bottom question mark, then the remaining cell in the corresponding $2 \\times 3$ rectangle must have the same colour, see Figure 7(b).\n\nA longer chain of height (or width) 2 always has a horizontal (resp., vertical) link and can be inscribed into a $3 \\times a$ rectangle. In this case we expand the minimal bounding rectangle across the long side which touches the mentioned link. On Figure 8(a) the corresponding expansion of the minimal bounding rectangle is coloured in light blue. The upper right corner cell must be also blue. Indeed it cannot be red or green. If it is not coloured in blue, see Figure 8(b), then all anti-hop paths from $F$ to ""?"" are blocked with green cells. And these green cells are surrounded by blue ones, what is impossible. In this case the green chain contains $a$ cells, which is exactly $1 / 3$ of the area of the rectangle.\n\n\n\n<img_3763>\n\nFigure 8 (a)\n\n<img_3147>\n\nFigure 8 (b)\n\nIn the remaining case the minimal bounding rectangle of the chain is of size $a \\times b$ where $a, b \\geqslant 3$. Denote by $\\ell$ the length of the chain (i.e. the number of cells in the chain).\n\nIf the chain has at least two diagonal links (see Figure 9), then $\\ell \\leqslant a+b-3 \\leqslant a b / 3$.\n\nIf the chain has only one diagonal link then $\\ell=a+b-2$. In this case the chain has horizontal and vertical end-links, and we expand the minimal bounding rectangle in two directions to get an $(a+1) \\times(b+1)$ rectangle. On Figure 10 a corresponding expansion of the minimal bounding rectangle is coloured in light red. Again the length of the chain does not exceed $1 / 3$ of the rectangle\'s area: $\\ell \\leqslant a+b-2 \\leqslant(a+1)(b+1) / 3$.\n\nOn the next step we will use the following statement: all cells in constructed rectangles are coloured red, green or blue (the cells upwards and to the right of green cells are blue; the cells downwards and to the left of green cells are red). The proof repeats the same arguments as before (see Figure 8(b).)\n\n<img_3252>\n\nFigure 9\n\n<img_3629>\n\nFigure 10\n\n<img_3644>\n\n(a)\n\n<img_3861>\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 11\n\nNote that all constructed rectangles are disjoint. Indeed, assume that two rectangles have a common cell. Using the above statement, one can see that the only such cell can be a common corner cell, as shown in Figure 11. Moreover, in this case both rectangles should be expanded, otherwise they would share a green corner cell.\n\nIf they were expanded along the same axis (see Figure 11(a)), then again the common corner cannot be coloured correctly. If they were expanded along different axes (see Figure 11(b)) then the two chains have a common point and must be connected in one chain. (These arguments work for $2 \\times 3$ and $1 \\times 3$ rectangles in a similar manner.)']"

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. Introduce specific numerical side lengths for $ABCD$ that satisfy the tangential condition ($AB + CD = BC + DA$): Set $AB = 7$, $BC = 2$, $CD = 6$, $DA = 3$ to create imbalance and asymmetry.
2. Add a real-world constraint by specifying the inradius: Set $r = 3$ to fix the scale and necessitate area calculation for coordinate determination.
3. Increase reasoning difficulty and computation by modifying the required output: Instead of proving equality, compute the numerical value of an area related to the configuration (e.g., the area of $\triangle XTY$ or $\triangle YZ X$, which involves points derived from the process and requires exact arithmetic under defined coordinates).
4. Ensure logical interconnection: The side lengths dictate the position of $I$ and $\omega$; the inradius fixes the area and enables coordinate assignment; the area computation depends on the defined points and circles.

Indeed, using the above arguments, we get\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\angle B D F=\\angle A F D-\\angle A B D=\\left(180^{\\circ}-\\angle F A D-\\angle F D A\\right)-(\\angle A B C-\\angle D B C) \\\\\n= & 180^{\\circ}-\\angle F A D-\\angle A B C=180^{\\circ}-\\angle D A E-\\angle F E A=\\angle F E D+\\angle A D E=\\angle F E D+\\angle D C B,\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich implies the desired tangency.\n\nSince the points $B, C, E$, and $F$ are concyclic, the powers of the point $T$ with respect to the circles $(B D C)$ and $(E D F)$ are equal. So their radical axis, which coincides with the common tangent at $D$, passes through $T$, and hence $T D^{2}=T E \\cdot T F=T B \\cdot T C$.\n\n\nNotice that $\\angle A Q E=\\angle Q C B$ and $\\angle A Q F=\\angle Q B C$; so, if we replace the point $D$ with $Q$ in the problem set up, the points $E, F$, and $T$ remain the same. So, by the Claim, we have $T Q^{2}=T B \\cdot T C=T D^{2}$.\n\nThus, there exists a circle $\\Gamma$ centred at $T$ and passing through $D$ and $Q$. We denote the second meeting point of the circles $\\Gamma$ and $(A D C)$ by $K$. Let the line $A C$ meet the circle $(D E K)$ again at $Y$; we intend to prove that $Y=X$. this will yield that the point $T$, as well as the centres $O_{1}$ and $O_{2}$, all lie on the perpendicular bisector of $D K$.\n\nLet $L=A D \\cap B C$. We perform an inversion centred at $C$; the images of the points will be denoted by primes, e.g., $A^{\\prime}$ is the image of $A$. We obtain the following configuration, constructed in a triangle $A^{\\prime} C L^{\\prime}$.\n\nThe points $D^{\\prime}$ and $Q^{\\prime}$ are chosen on the circumcircle $\\Omega$ of $A^{\\prime} L^{\\prime} C$ such that $\\sphericalangle\\left(L^{\\prime} C, D^{\\prime} C\\right)=$ $\\sphericalangle\\left(Q^{\\prime} C, A^{\\prime} C\\right)$, which means that $A^{\\prime} L^{\\prime} \\| D^{\\prime} Q^{\\prime}$. The lines $D^{\\prime} Q^{\\prime}$ and $A^{\\prime} C$ meet at $E^{\\prime}$.\n\nA circle $\\Gamma^{\\prime}$ centred on $C L^{\\prime}$ passes through $D^{\\prime}$ and $Q^{\\prime}$. Notice here that $B^{\\prime}$ lies on the segment $C L^{\\prime}$, and that $\\angle A^{\\prime} B^{\\prime} C=\\angle B A C=2 \\angle L A C=2 \\angle A^{\\prime} L^{\\prime} C$, so that $B^{\\prime} L^{\\prime}=B^{\\prime} A^{\\prime}$, and $B^{\\prime}$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $A^{\\prime} L^{\\prime}$ (which coincides with that of $D^{\\prime} Q^{\\prime}$ ). All this means that $B^{\\prime}$ is the centre of $\\Gamma^{\\prime}$.\n\nFinally, $K^{\\prime}$ is the second meeting point of $A^{\\prime} D^{\\prime}$ and $\\Gamma^{\\prime}$, and $Y^{\\prime}$ is the second meeting point of the circle $\\left(D^{\\prime} K^{\\prime} E^{\\prime}\\right)$ and the line $A^{\\prime} E^{\\prime}$, We have $\\sphericalangle\\left(Y^{\\prime} K^{\\prime}, K^{\\prime} A^{\\prime}\\right)=\\sphericalangle\\left(Y^{\\prime} E^{\\prime}, E^{\\prime} D^{\\prime}\\right)=$ $\\sphericalangle\\left(Y^{\\prime} A^{\\prime}, A^{\\prime} L^{\\prime}\\right)$, so $A^{\\prime} L^{\\prime}$ is tangent to the circumcircle $\\omega$ of the triangle $Y^{\\prime} A^{\\prime} K^{\\prime}$.\n\nLet $O$ and $O^{*}$ be the centres of $\\Omega$ and $\\omega$, respectively. Then $O^{*} A^{\\prime} \\perp A^{\\prime} L^{\\prime} \\perp B^{\\prime} O$. The projections of vectors $\\overrightarrow{O^{*} A^{\\prime}}$ and $\\overrightarrow{B^{\\prime} O}$ onto $K^{\\prime} D^{\\prime}$ are equal to $\\overrightarrow{K^{\\prime} A^{\\prime}} / 2=\\overrightarrow{K^{\\prime} D^{\\prime}} / 2-\\overrightarrow{A^{\\prime} D^{\\prime}} / 2$. So $\\overrightarrow{O^{*} A^{\\prime}}=\\overrightarrow{B^{\\prime} O}$, or equivalently $\\overrightarrow{A^{\\prime} O}=\\overrightarrow{O^{*} B^{\\prime}}$. Projecting this equality onto $A^{\\prime} C$, we see that the projection of $\\overrightarrow{O^{*} B^{\\prime}}$ equals $\\overrightarrow{A^{\\prime} C} / 2$. Since $O^{*}$ is projected to the midpoint of $A^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime}$, this yields that $B^{\\prime}$ is projected to the midpoint of $C Y^{\\prime}$, i.e., $B^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime}=B^{\\prime} C$ and $\\angle B^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime} C=\\angle B^{\\prime} C Y^{\\prime}$. In the original figure, this rewrites as $\\angle C B Y=\\angle B C Y$, so $Y$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $B C$, as desired.\n\n<img_3172>']"

Determine \(a_{100}\) and the sum of terms over the minimal period once the sequence becomes periodic.",success,122.05,"['We will make repeated use of the following simple observation:\n\nLemma 1. If a positive integer $d$ divides $a_{n}$ and $a_{n-m}$ for some $m$ and $n>2 m$, it also divides $a_{n-2 m}$. If $d$ divides $a_{n}$ and $a_{n-2 m}$, it also divides $a_{n-m}$.\n\nProof. Both parts are obvious since $a_{n}$ divides $a_{n-2 m}+a_{n-m}$.\n\nClaim. The sequence $\\left(a_{n}\\right)$ is bounded.\n\nProof. Suppose the contrary. Then there exist infinitely many indices $n$ such that $a_{n}$ is greater than each of the previous terms $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n-1}$. Let $a_{n}=k$ be such a term, $n>10$. For each $s<\\frac{n}{2}$ the number $a_{n}=k$ divides $a_{n-s}+a_{n-2 s}<2 k$, therefore\n\n$$\na_{n-s}+a_{n-2 s}=k \\text {. }\n$$\n\nIn particular,\n\n$$\na_{n}=a_{n-1}+a_{n-2}=a_{n-2}+a_{n-4}=a_{n-4}+a_{n-8}\n$$\n\nthat is, $a_{n-1}=a_{n-4}$ and $a_{n-2}=a_{n-8}$. It follows from Lemma 1 that $a_{n-1}$ divides $a_{n-1-3 s}$ for $3 s<n-1$ and $a_{n-2}$ divides $a_{n-2-6 s}$ for $6 s<n-2$. Since at least one of the numbers $a_{n-1}$ and $a_{n-2}$ is at least $a_{n} / 2$, so is some $a_{i}$ with $i \\leqslant 6$. However, $a_{n}$ can be arbitrarily large, a contradiction.\n\nSince $\\left(a_{n}\\right)$ is bounded, there exist only finitely many $i$ for which $a_{i}$ appears in the sequence finitely many times. In other words, there exists $N$ such that if $a_{i}=t$ and $i>N$, then $a_{j}=t$ for infinitely many $j$.\n\nClearly the sequence $\\left(a_{n+N}\\right)_{n>0}$ satisfies the divisibility condition, and it is enough to prove that this sequence is eventually periodic. Thus truncating the sequence if necessary, we can assume that each number appears infinitely many times in the sequence. Let $k$ be the maximum number appearing in the sequence.\n\nLemma 2. If a positive integer $d$ divides $a_{n}$ for some $n$, then the numbers $i$ such that $d$ divides $a_{i}$ form an arithmetical progression with an odd difference.\n\nProof. Let $i_{1}<i_{2}<i_{3}<\\ldots$ be all the indices $i$ such that $d$ divides $a_{i}$. If $i_{s}+i_{s+1}$ is even, it follows from Lemma 1 that $d$ also divides $\\frac{a_{i_{s}+i_{s+1}}^{2}}{}$, impossible since $i_{s}<\\frac{i_{s}+i_{s+1}}{2}<i_{s+1}$. Thus $i_{s}$ and $i_{s+1}$ are always of different parity, and therefore $i_{s}+i_{s+2}$ is even. Applying Lemma 1 again, we see that $d$ divides $\\frac{a_{i_{s}+i_{s+2}}}{2}$, hence $\\frac{i_{s}+i_{s+2}}{2}=i_{s+1}$,\n\nWe are ready now to solve the problem.\n\nThe number of positive divisors of all terms of the progression is finite. Let $d_{s}$ be the difference of the progression corresponding to $s$, that is, $s$ divides $a_{n}$ if and only if it divides $a_{n+t d_{s}}$ for any positive integer $t$. Let $D$ be the product of all $d_{s}$. Then each $s$ dividing a term of the progression divides $a_{n}$ if and only if it divides $a_{n+D}$. This means that the sets of divisors of $a_{n}$ and $a_{n+D}$ coincide, and $a_{n+D}=a_{n}$. Thus $D$ is a period of the sequence.']"

- **Key variables**: Terms \(a_i\), indices \(i, j, n\), and the fixed cutoff \(n > 2017\).

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
1. **Increase relational complexity**: Modify the max operation from pairs to triples (adding one more variable) to expand the search space and computational load. The new recurrence will be \(a_n = -\max_{i+j+k=n} (a_i + a_j + a_k)\) for \(n > 2017\), introducing more dependencies and harder max calculations.  
2. **Concrete initial conditions**: Specify deterministic initial values for \(a_1\) to \(a_{2017}\) that prevent trivial patterns—use a mix of growth and oscillation (e.g., \(a_i = i \cdot (-1)^i\)) to necessitate detailed computation.  
3. **Define non-trivial computational task**: Instead of proving boundedness, require computing a specific, large-indexed term \(a_n\) (e.g., \(n = 5000\)) that cannot be derived from closed forms and demands iterative sequence construction with the complex max.  
4. **Ensure interconnectivity and challenge**: The triple-sum max depends on combinations of three indices, tying initial values to recursive steps. Computing \(a_{5000}\) at a high index ensures the problem scales beyond manual feasibility, leveraging the sequence's recursive depth.

Therefore, $M_{n+1}=M_{n}$ and $m_{n+1} \\leqslant 2 M_{n}=2 M_{n+1}$. So, the index $n+1$ is also lucky, and $M_{n+1}=M_{n}$. Applying the same arguments repeatedly, we obtain that all indices $k>n$ are lucky (i.e., $m_{k} \\leqslant 2 M_{k}$ for all these indices), and $M_{k}=M_{n}$ for all such indices. Thus, all of the $m_{k}$ and $M_{k}$ are bounded by $2 M_{n}$.\n\nCase 2. Assume now that there is no lucky index, i.e., $2 M_{n}<m_{n}$ for all $n>D$. Then (1) shows that for all $n>D$ we have $m_{n} \\leqslant m_{n+1} \\leqslant m_{n}$, so $m_{n}=m_{D+1}$ for all $n>D$.

2.  **Amplify Scale/Constraint:** Increase indices significantly ($N = 1000000$). Impose constraints on $\{b_n\}$: Each $b_n$ must be a multiple of a value $g_{n-3}$ defined strictly in terms of previous $a$-terms ($g_{m} = \gcd(a_{m}, a_{m-1} + 1)$ for $m \geq 2$).

- Function: \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\)  
- Condition: For all \(x, y \in \mathbb{R}\) with \((f(x) + y)(f(y) + x) > 0\), the equality \(f(x) + y = f(y) + x\) holds.  
- Original Goal: Prove the inequality \(f(x) + y \leq f(y) + x\) for \(x > y\).  
- Key Variables: \(x\) and \(y\) (real numbers), and the function \(f\).  
- Theme: Properties of functions under conditional equalities and inequalities, leading to specific functional behaviors (e.g., \(f(x) - x\) constant).  
- Potential for Complexity: Add numerical computation with specific outputs, incorporate large parameters, introduce asymptotic behavior or limits, and ensure interconnected logic.

#### Step 2
**#Plan#:**  
1. **Modify the Original Proof Goal into a Computational Task:** Replace the proof of an inequality with the computation of a specific numerical value derived from the function. This shifts focus from verification to calculation.  
2. **Incorporate Asymptotic Analysis for Increased Difficulty:** Add a limit process involving a large parameter to demand reasoning about global behavior rather than pointwise properties. Specifically, compute the asymptotic limit of \(f(x)/x\) as \(x \to \infty\), exploiting that the condition implies \(f(x) - x\) is constant (but this must be inferred, not assumed).  
3. **Add Input Parameter for Concreteness and Computation:** Introduce a given initial value \(f(0) = c\) to anchor the function but make the computation invariant to \(c\) for complexity. This requires deriving that \(f(x) = x + c\) implicitly.  
4. **Ensure Coherent Complexity:** The limit computation is non-trivial as it necessitates understanding the functional constraint deeply (e.g., showing constancy of \(f(x) - x\)) before calculation, and it combines analysis with functional equations. The answer is specific but requires multi-step rigorous derivation.  
5. **Maintain Theme Consistency:** The core functional condition and real domain are preserved, ensuring the rewritten instruction stays aligned with the original theme while increasing difficulty through computation and asymptotic evaluation.

Then on the interval $(X-x ; x]$ the function $g$ attains at most two values - namely, $X$ and, possibly, some $Y>X$. Similarly, if $X>2 x$, then $g$ attains at most two values on $[x ; X-x)$ - namely, $X$ and, possibly, some $Y<X$.\n\nProof. We start with the first claim of the lemma. Notice that $X-x<x$, so the considered interval is nonempty.\n\nTake any $a \\in(X-x ; x)$ with $g(a) \\neq X$ (if it exists). If $g(a)<X$, then (*) yields $g(a) \\leqslant$ $a+x \\leqslant g(x)=X$, so $a \\leqslant X-x$ which is impossible. Thus, $g(a)>X$ and hence by $(*)$ we get $X \\leqslant a+x \\leqslant g(a)$.\n\nNow, for any $b \\in(X-x ; x)$ with $g(b) \\neq X$ we similarly get $b+x \\leqslant g(b)$. Therefore, the number $a+b$ (which is smaller than each of $a+x$ and $b+x$ ) cannot lie between $g(a)$ and $g(b)$, which by $(*)$ implies that $g(a)=g(b)$. Hence $g$ may attain only two values on $(X-x ; x]$, namely $X$ and $g(a)>X$.\n\nTo prove the second claim, notice that $g_{1}(-x)=-X<2 \\cdot(-x)$, so $g_{1}$ attains at most two values on $(-X+x,-x]$, i.e., $-X$ and, possibly, some $-Y>-X$. Passing back to $g$, we get what we need.\n\nLemma 2. If $X<2 x$, then $g$ is constant on $(X-x ; x)$. Similarly, if $X>2 x$, then $g$ is constant on $(x ; X-x)$.\n\nProof. Again, it suffices to prove the first claim only. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exist $a, b \\in(X-x ; x)$ with $g(a) \\neq g(b)$; by Lemma 1 , we may assume that $g(a)=X$ and $Y=g(b)>X$.\n\nNotice that $\\min \\{X-a, X-b\\}>X-x$, so there exists a $u \\in(X-x ; x)$ such that $u<\\min \\{X-a, X-b\\}$. By Lemma 1, we have either $g(u)=X$ or $g(u)=Y$. In the former case, by (*) we have $X \\leqslant u+b \\leqslant Y$ which contradicts $u<X-b$. In the second case, by (*) we have $X \\leqslant u+a \\leqslant Y$ which contradicts $u<X-a$. Thus the lemma is proved.\n\n\n\nLemma 3. If $X<2 x$, then $g(a)=X$ for all $a \\in(X-x ; x)$. Similarly, if $X>2 x$, then $g(a)=X$ for all $a \\in(x ; X-x)$.\n\nProof. Again, we only prove the first claim.\n\nBy Lemmas 1 and 2, this claim may be violated only if $g$ takes on a constant value $Y>X$ on $(X-x, x)$. Choose any $a, b \\in(X-x ; x)$ with $a<b$. By $(*)$, we have\n\n$$\nY \\geqslant b+x \\geqslant X\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nIn particular, we have $Y \\geqslant b+x>2 a$. Applying Lemma 2 to $a$ in place of $x$, we obtain that $g$ is constant on $(a, Y-a)$. By (2) again, we have $x \\leqslant Y-b<Y-a$; so $x, b \\in(a ; Y-a)$. But $X=g(x) \\neq g(b)=Y$, which is a contradiction.\n\nNow we are able to finish the solution. Assume that $g(x)>g(y)$ for some $x<y$. Denote $X=g(x)$ and $Y=g(y)$; by $(*)$, we have $X \\geqslant x+y \\geqslant Y$, so $Y-y \\leqslant x<y \\leqslant X-x$, and hence $(Y-y ; y) \\cap(x ; X-x)=(x, y) \\neq \\varnothing$. On the other hand, since $Y-y<y$ and $x<X-x$, Lemma 3 shows that $g$ should attain a constant value $X$ on $(x ; X-x)$ and a constant value $Y \\neq X$ on $(Y-y ; y)$. Since these intervals overlap, we get the final contradiction.'
 'As in the previous solution, we pass to the function $g$ satisfying $(*)$ and notice that we need to prove the condition (1). We will also make use of the function $g_{1}$.\n\nIf $g$ is constant, then (1) is clearly satisfied. So, in the sequel we assume that $g$ takes on at least two different values. Now we collect some information about the function $g$.\n\nClaim 1. For any $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$, all the solutions of $g(x)=c$ are bounded.\n\nProof. Fix any $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $g(y) \\neq c$. Assume first that $g(y)>c$. Now, for any $x$ with $g(x)=c$, by $(*)$ we have $c \\leqslant x+y \\leqslant g(y)$, or $c-y \\leqslant x \\leqslant g(y)-y$. Since $c$ and $y$ are constant, we get what we need.\n\nIf $g(y)<c$, we may switch to the function $g_{1}$ for which we have $g_{1}(-y)>-c$. By the above arguments, we obtain that all the solutions of $g_{1}(-x)=-c$ are bounded, which is equivalent to what we need.\n\nAs an immediate consequence, the function $g$ takes on infinitely many values, which shows that the next claim is indeed widely applicable.\n\nClaim 2. If $g(x)<g(y)<g(z)$, then $x<z$.\n\nProof. By $(*)$, we have $g(x) \\leqslant x+y \\leqslant g(y) \\leqslant z+y \\leqslant g(z)$, so $x+y \\leqslant z+y$, as required.\n\nClaim 3. Assume that $g(x)>g(y)$ for some $x<y$. Then $g(a) \\in\\{g(x), g(y)\\}$ for all $a \\in[x ; y]$.\n\nProof. If $g(y)<g(a)<g(x)$, then the triple $(y, a, x)$ violates Claim 2. If $g(a)<g(y)<g(x)$, then the triple $(a, y, x)$ violates Claim 2. If $g(y)<g(x)<g(a)$, then the triple $(y, x, a)$ violates Claim 2. The only possible cases left are $g(a) \\in\\{g(x), g(y)\\}$.\n\nIn view of Claim 3, we say that an interval $I$ (which may be open, closed, or semi-open) is a Dirichlet interval* if the function $g$ takes on just two values on $I$.\n\nAssume now, for the sake of contradiction, that (1) is violated by some $x<y$. By Claim 3, $[x ; y]$ is a Dirichlet interval. Set\n\n$r=\\inf \\{a:(a ; y]$ is a Dirichlet interval $\\}$ and $s=\\sup \\{b:[x ; b)$ is a Dirichlet interval $\\}$.\n\nClearly, $r \\leqslant x<y \\leqslant s$. By Claim $1, r$ and $s$ are finite. Denote $X=g(x), Y=g(y)$, and $\\Delta=(y-x) / 2$.\n\nSuppose first that there exists a $t \\in(r ; r+\\Delta)$ with $f(t)=Y$. By the definition of $r$, the interval $(r-\\Delta ; y]$ is not Dirichlet, so there exists an $r^{\\prime} \\in(r-\\Delta ; r]$ such that $g\\left(r^{\\prime}\\right) \\notin\\{X, Y\\}$.[^0]\n\n\n[^0]:    *The name Dirichlet interval is chosen for the reason that $g$ theoretically might act similarly to the Dirichlet function on this interval.\n\n\n\nThe function $g$ attains at least three distinct values on $\\left[r^{\\prime} ; y\\right]$, namely $g\\left(r^{\\prime}\\right), g(x)$, and $g(y)$. Claim 3 now yields $g\\left(r^{\\prime}\\right) \\leqslant g(y)$; the equality is impossible by the choice of $r^{\\prime}$, so in fact $g\\left(r^{\\prime}\\right)<Y$. Applying $(*)$ to the pairs $\\left(r^{\\prime}, y\\right)$ and $(t, x)$ we obtain $r^{\\prime}+y \\leqslant Y \\leqslant t+x$, whence $r-\\Delta+y<r^{\\prime}+y \\leqslant t+x<r+\\Delta+x$, or $y-x<2 \\Delta$. This is a contradiction.\n\nThus, $g(t)=X$ for all $t \\in(r ; r+\\Delta)$. Applying the same argument to $g_{1}$, we get $g(t)=Y$ for all $t \\in(s-\\Delta ; s)$.\n\nFinally, choose some $s_{1}, s_{2} \\in(s-\\Delta ; s)$ with $s_{1}<s_{2}$ and denote $\\delta=\\left(s_{2}-s_{1}\\right) / 2$. As before, we choose $r^{\\prime} \\in(r-\\delta ; r)$ with $g\\left(r^{\\prime}\\right) \\notin\\{X, Y\\}$ and obtain $g\\left(r^{\\prime}\\right)<Y$. Choose any $t \\in(r ; r+\\delta)$; by the above arguments, we have $g(t)=X$ and $g\\left(s_{1}\\right)=g\\left(s_{2}\\right)=Y$. As before, we apply (*) to the pairs $\\left(r^{\\prime}, s_{2}\\right)$ and $\\left(t, s_{1}\\right)$ obtaining $r-\\delta+s_{2}<r^{\\prime}+s_{2} \\leqslant Y \\leqslant t+s_{1}<r+\\delta+s_{1}$, or $s_{2}-s_{1}<2 \\delta$.

- **Shape and Parameters**: A rectangle with odd integer side lengths (no specific dimensions given).  
- **Division Process**: Divided into smaller rectangles with integer side lengths (no constraints on division pattern or number of pieces).  
- **Property of Interest**: At least one small rectangle has distances from all four sides of the large rectangle that are either all odd integers or all even integers.  
- **Key Elements for Manipulation**: Side lengths of large rectangle, properties of small rectangles, distance conditions (parity), existence proof.  
- **Theme**: Combinatorial geometry with parity constraints; focus on invariants under dissection.  

Step 2  
**#Plan#**:  
- **Modify Variables and Input**: Specify the large rectangle as a square with odd side length \(s\) to simplify input and increase computational focus. The odd side constraint must be retained.  
- **Change from Existence to Enumeration**: Instead of proving existence, request computation of the exact number of small rectangles satisfying the property. This requires counting over a fixed structure to make it non-trivial.  
- **Concretize Division and Properties**: Fix the division to a grid of identical 1x1 units (small rectangles) to enable precise calculation. The small rectangles must have integer sides, so unit squares are valid. Change distances to be measured to the sides based on grid coordinates.  
- **Increase Difficulty via Scale and Specificity**: For a large odd \(s\), computing the number involves a non-obvious formula and requires handling parity interactions (all even or all odd distances). Connect to coordinate geometry: for a unit square at \((i,j)\), distances from sides are \(i\) (left), \(j\) (bottom), \(s-1-i\) (right), \(s-1-j\) (top), and their parities must match.  
- **Ensure Logical Flow and Complexity**: The fixed grid assumption adds real-world structure (e.g., pixel grids) while demanding derived computation. The formula \((s^2 + 1)/2\) must be computed exactly, which is non-trivial for large \(s\) and requires understanding of intermediate steps.

The number $f_{X}(s)$ counts the $s^{t h}$ number not in $X$, which implies that\n\n$$\nf_{X}(s)=s+\\left|X \\cap\\left\\{1,2, \\ldots, f_{X}(s)\\right\\}\\right|\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nSince $f_{X}(s) \\geqslant s$, we have that\n\n$$\n\\left\\{f_{X}(s)+1, f_{X}(s)+2, \\ldots\\right\\} \\cap X=\\left\\{f_{X}(s)+1, f_{X}(s)+2, \\ldots\\right\\} \\cap Y\n$$\n\nwhich, together with the assumption that $|X|=|Y|$, gives\n\n$$\n\\left|X \\cap\\left\\{1,2, \\ldots, f_{X}(s)\\right\\}\\right|=\\left|Y \\cap\\left\\{1,2, \\ldots, f_{X}(s)\\right\\}\\right|\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\n\n\nNow consider the equation\n\n$$\nt-|Y \\cap\\{1,2, \\ldots, t\\}|=s\n$$\n\nThis equation is satisfied only when $t \\in\\left[f_{Y}(s), f_{Y}(s+1)\\right)$, because the left hand side counts the number of elements up to $t$ that are not in $Y$. We have that the value $t=f_{X}(s)$ satisfies the above equation because of (1) and (2). Furthermore, since $f_{X}(s) \\notin X$ and $f_{X}(s) \\geqslant s$, we have that $f_{X}(s) \\notin Y$ due to the maximality of $s$. Thus, by the above discussion, we must have $f_{X}(s)=f_{Y}(s)$.\n\nFinally, we arrive at a contradiction. The value $f_{X}(s)$ is neither in $X$ nor in $f_{X}(Y)$, because $s$ is not in $Y$ by assumption. Thus, $f_{X}(s) \\notin X * Y$. However, since $s \\in X$, we have $f_{Y}(s) \\in Y * X$, a contradiction.\n\nWe are now ready to finish the proof. Note first of all that $\\left|A^{* b}\\right|=a b=\\left|B^{* a}\\right|$. Moreover, since $A * B=B * A$, and $*$ is associative, it follows that $A^{* b} * B^{* a}=B^{* a} * A^{* b}$. Thus, by Lemma 2 , we have $A^{* b}=B^{* a}$, as desired.']"

- **Points of interest**: \(D\) is the intersection of diagonals \(AC_1\) and \(A_1C\); \(\omega\) is the circumcircle of \(ABC\); \(E\) is the second intersection of \(\omega\) and the circumcircle of \(A_1BC_1\) (distinct from \(B\)).
- **Action to prove**: The lines \(BB_1\) and \(DE\) intersect on \(\omega\).
- **Theme**: Symmetric properties, circle geometry, and point intersections in convex polygons.

### Step 2
**#Plan#**:
- **Modify a condition**: Replace the equality \(AB = BC\) with a ratio \(AB : BC = k : 1\) (for \(k > 0\)), introducing a parameter \(k\) to generalize and complicate the setup.
- **Add a real-world constraint**: Specify a coordinate system for computability—set the common perpendicular bisector as the y-axis and fix coordinates: \(A\) at \((2,0)\), \(C\) at \((0,2)\), and \(B\) at \((p, p)\) where \(p\) is variable (ensure convexity with positions).
- **Change the action to computational**: Instead of proving an intersection on \(\omega\), ask for the specific distance \(DE\) (between \(D\) and \(E\)) as a function of \(k\), requiring parametric computation. This involves multiple intersections and circle equations, increasing algebraic complexity.
- **Ensure coherence**: Variables are interconnected: \(p\) depends on \(AB = k \cdot BC\) via distance equations, and computations must handle circles, intersections, and scaling with \(k\). The resulting output is a non-trivial expression, demanding advanced solving techniques.

#Elements Identified#:  
- Variables and parameters: integer \(n \geq 3\), polygons \(\mathcal{A}\) and \(\mathcal{B}\).  
- Conditions: both polygons are regular and lie in the plane; vertices of \(\mathcal{A}\) that are inside or on the boundary of \(\mathcal{B}\) must be consecutive.  
- Participants: vertices of \(\mathcal{A}\), boundary of \(\mathcal{B}\).  
- Actions: proving the consecutive vertex property.  
- Theme: geometric properties of convex polygons, specifically the arrangement of points relative to a different convex shape.  
- Core concept: exploiting polygon regularity, convexity, and rotational symmetry to establish a linear separation property.  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
- Modify conditions: Mandate that both polygons share a common center to introduce symmetry and reduce degrees of freedom, while adding a radial size parameter.  
- Add parameters and dependencies: Introduce circumradii \(r_A\) and \(r_B\) for \(\mathcal{A}\) and \(\mathcal{B}\), with their ratio \(\rho = r_B / r_A\), and add a relative rotation angle \(\varphi\) between them (fixing \(\mathcal{A}\) and rotating \(\mathcal{B}\)). This creates functional dependencies.  
- Change action and theme: Transform the proof into a non-trivial computational problem by requiring the calculation of the maximum number of vertices satisfying the condition over all rotations, as a function of \(n\) and \(\rho\). This leverages consecutive vertex properties and maximizes coverage under radial scaling.  
- Increase complexity: Incorporate optimization over \(\varphi\) to add a layer of variability and challenge, ensuring the problem demands angular and radial analysis, periodicity considerations, and critical configuration identification.

Let $O_{A}$ and $O_{B}$ be the centers of $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{B}$, respectively, and let $A$ be an arbitrary vertex of $\\mathcal{A}$. Let $\\overrightarrow{O_{B} C}$ be the vector co-directional to $\\overrightarrow{O_{A} A}$, with $C$ lying on the perimeter of $\\mathcal{B}$. The rotations of $C$ around $O_{B}$ by multiples of $2 \\pi / n$ form the required polygon. Indeed, it is regular, inscribed into $\\mathcal{B}$ (due to the rotational symmetry of $\\mathcal{B}$ ), and finally the translation/homothety mapping $\\overrightarrow{O_{A} A}$ to $\\overrightarrow{O_{B} C}$ maps $\\mathcal{A}$ to $\\mathcal{C}$.\n\nNow we separate two cases.\n\n<img_3389>\n\nConstruction of $\\mathcal{C}$\n\n<img_3994>\n\nCase 1: Translation\n\nCase 1: $\\mathcal{C}$ is a translation of $\\mathcal{A}$ by a vector $\\vec{v}$.\n\nDenote by $t$ the translation transform by vector $\\vec{v}$. We need to prove that the vertices of $\\mathcal{C}$ which stay in $\\mathcal{B}$ under $t$ are consecutive. To visualize the argument, we refer the plane to Cartesian coordinates so that the $x$-axis is co-directional with $\\vec{v}$. This way, the notions of right/left and top/bottom are also introduced, according to the $x$ - and $y$-coordinates, respectively.\n\nLet $B_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and $B_{\\mathrm{B}}$ be the top and the bottom vertices of $\\mathcal{B}$ (if several vertices are extremal, we take the rightmost of them). They split the perimeter of $\\mathcal{B}$ into the right part $\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ and the left part $\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ (the vertices $B_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and $B_{\\mathrm{B}}$ are assumed to lie in both parts); each part forms a connected subset of the perimeter of $\\mathcal{B}$. So the vertices of $\\mathcal{C}$ are also split into two parts $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{L}} \\subset \\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{R}} \\subset \\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{R}}$, each of which consists of consecutive vertices.\n\nNow, all the points in $\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ (and hence in $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ ) move out from $\\mathcal{B}$ under $t$, since they are the rightmost points of $\\mathcal{B}$ on the corresponding horizontal lines. It remains to prove that the vertices of $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ which stay in $\\mathcal{B}$ under $t$ are consecutive.\n\nFor this purpose, let $C_{1}, C_{2}$, and $C_{3}$ be three vertices in $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ such that $C_{2}$ is between $C_{1}$ and $C_{3}$, and $t\\left(C_{1}\\right)$ and $t\\left(C_{3}\\right)$ lie in $\\mathcal{B}$; we need to prove that $t\\left(C_{2}\\right) \\in \\mathcal{B}$ as well. Let $A_{i}=t\\left(C_{i}\\right)$. The line through $C_{2}$ parallel to $\\vec{v}$ crosses the segment $C_{1} C_{3}$ to the right of $C_{2}$; this means that this line crosses $A_{1} A_{3}$ to the right of $A_{2}$, so $A_{2}$ lies inside the triangle $A_{1} C_{2} A_{3}$ which is contained in $\\mathcal{B}$. This yields the desired result.\n\nCase 2: $\\mathcal{C}$ is a homothetic image of $\\mathcal{A}$ centered at $X$ with factor $k>0$.\n\n\n\nDenote by $h$ the homothety mapping $\\mathcal{C}$ to $\\mathcal{A}$. We need now to prove that the vertices of $\\mathcal{C}$ which stay in $\\mathcal{B}$ after applying $h$ are consecutive. If $X \\in \\mathcal{B}$, the claim is easy. Indeed, if $k<1$, then the vertices of $\\mathcal{A}$ lie on the segments of the form $X C$ ( $C$ being a vertex of $\\mathcal{C})$ which lie in $\\mathcal{B}$. If $k>1$, then the vertices of $\\mathcal{A}$ lie on the extensions of such segments $X C$ beyond $C$, and almost all these extensions lie outside $\\mathcal{B}$. The exceptions may occur only in case when $X$ lies on the boundary of $\\mathcal{B}$, and they may cause one or two vertices of $\\mathcal{A}$ stay on the boundary of $\\mathcal{B}$. But even in this case those vertices are still consecutive.\n\nSo, from now on we assume that $X \\notin \\mathcal{B}$.\n\nNow, there are two vertices $B_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and $\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{B}}$ of $\\mathcal{B}$ such that $\\mathcal{B}$ is contained in the angle $\\angle B_{\\mathrm{T}} X B_{\\mathrm{B}}$; if there are several options, say, for $B_{\\mathrm{T}}$, then we choose the farthest one from $X$ if $k>1$, and the nearest one if $k<1$.

Again, the perimeter of $\\mathcal{B}$ is split by $B_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and $B_{\\mathrm{B}}$ into the right part $\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ and the left part $\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{L}}$, and the set of vertices of $\\mathcal{C}$ is split into two subsets $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{R}} \\subset \\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ and $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{L}} \\subset \\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{L}}$.\n\n<img_3597>\n\nCase $2, X$ inside $\\mathcal{B}$\n\n<img_3767>\n\nSubcase 2.1: $k>1$\n\nSubcase 2.1: $k>1$.\n\nIn this subcase, all points from $\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ (and hence from $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ ) move out from $\\mathcal{B}$ under $h$, because they are the farthest points of $\\mathcal{B}$ on the corresponding rays emanated from $X$. It remains to prove that the vertices of $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ which stay in $\\mathcal{B}$ under $h$ are consecutive.\n\nAgain, let $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$ be three vertices in $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ such that $C_{2}$ is between $C_{1}$ and $C_{3}$, and $h\\left(C_{1}\\right)$ and $h\\left(C_{3}\\right)$ lie in $\\mathcal{B}$. Let $A_{i}=h\\left(C_{i}\\right)$. Then the ray $X C_{2}$ crosses the segment $C_{1} C_{3}$ beyond $C_{2}$, so this ray crosses $A_{1} A_{3}$ beyond $A_{2}$; this implies that $A_{2}$ lies in the triangle $A_{1} C_{2} A_{3}$, which is contained in $\\mathcal{B}$.\n\n<img_3986>\n\nSubcase $2.2: k<1$\n\nSubcase 2.2: $k<1$.\n\nThis case is completely similar to the previous one. All points from $\\mathcal{B}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ (and hence from $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ move out from $\\mathcal{B}$ under $h$, because they are the nearest points of $\\mathcal{B}$ on the corresponding\n\n\n\nrays emanated from $X$. Assume that $C_{1}, C_{2}$, and $C_{3}$ are three vertices in $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ such that $C_{2}$ lies between $C_{1}$ and $C_{3}$, and $h\\left(C_{1}\\right)$ and $h\\left(C_{3}\\right)$ lie in $\\mathcal{B}$; let $A_{i}=h\\left(C_{i}\\right)$. Then $A_{2}$ lies on the segment $X C_{2}$, and the segments $X A_{2}$ and $A_{1} A_{3}$ cross each other. Thus $A_{2}$ lies in the triangle $A_{1} C_{2} A_{3}$, which is contained in $\\mathcal{B}$.'

Say that a subset $I \\subseteq[n]$ is connected if the elements of this set are consecutive in the cyclic order (in other words, if we join each $i$ with $i+1 \\bmod n$ by an edge, this subset is connected in the usual graph sense). Clearly, the union of two connected subsets sharing at least one element is connected too. Next, for any half-plane $\\mathcal{H}$ the indices of vertices of, say, $\\mathcal{A}$ that lie in $\\mathcal{H}$ form a connected set.\n\nTo access the problem, we denote\n\n$$\nM=\\left\\{j \\in[n]: A_{j} \\notin \\mathcal{B}\\right\\}, \\quad M_{i}=\\left\\{j \\in[n]: A_{j} \\notin \\mathcal{H}_{i}\\right\\} \\quad \\text { for } i \\in[n]\n$$\n\nWe need to prove that $[n] \\backslash M$ is connected, which is equivalent to $M$ being connected. On the other hand, since $\\mathcal{B}=\\bigcap_{i \\in[n]} \\mathcal{H}_{i}$, we have $M=\\bigcup_{i \\in[n]} M_{i}$, where the sets $M_{i}$ are easier to investigate.

Therefore, if some $j$ lies in $M_{i}$, then by (1) so does $i$.\n\nIn view of Property 2, it is useful to define the set\n\n$$\nM^{\\prime}=\\left\\{i \\in[n]: i \\in M_{i}\\right\\}=\\left\\{i \\in[n]: M_{i} \\neq \\varnothing\\right\\}\n$$\n\nProperty 3: The set $M^{\\prime}$ is connected.\n\nProof. To prove this property, we proceed on with the investigation started in (2) to write\n\n$$\ni \\in M^{\\prime} \\Longleftrightarrow A_{i} \\in M_{i} \\Longleftrightarrow\\left\\langle\\overrightarrow{B_{i} A_{i}}, \\overrightarrow{b_{i}}\\right\\rangle<0 \\Longleftrightarrow\\left\\langle\\overrightarrow{O_{B} O_{A}}, \\overrightarrow{b_{i}}\\right\\rangle<\\left\\langle\\overrightarrow{O_{B} B_{i}}, \\overrightarrow{b_{i}}\\right\\rangle+\\left\\langle\\overrightarrow{A_{i} O_{A}}, \\overrightarrow{b_{i}}\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nThe right-hand part of the obtained inequality does not depend on $i$, due to the rotational symmetry; denote its constant value by $\\mu$. Thus, $i \\in M^{\\prime}$ if and only if $\\left\\langle\\overrightarrow{O_{B} O_{A}}, \\overrightarrow{b_{i}}\\right\\rangle<\\mu$. This condition is in turn equivalent to the fact that $B_{i}$ lies in a certain (open) half-plane whose boundary line is orthogonal to $O_{B} O_{A}$; thus, it defines a connected set.\n\nNow we can finish the solution. Since $M^{\\prime} \\subseteq M$, we have\n\n$$\nM=\\bigcup_{i \\in[n]} M_{i}=M^{\\prime} \\cup \\bigcup_{i \\in[n]} M_{i}\n$$\n\nso $M$ can be obtained from $M^{\\prime}$ by adding all the sets $M_{i}$ one by one. All these sets are connected, and each nonempty $M_{i}$ contains an element of $M^{\\prime}$ (namely, $i$ ). Thus their union is also connected.']"

- Points: A, B, C, D, I (incenter of quad), Ia (incenter of ΔDAB), Ib (incenter of ΔABC), Ic (incenter of ΔBCD), Id (incenter of ΔCDA).  
- Circles: Circle defined by A, Ib, Id and circle defined by C, Ib, Id; common external tangents meet at X. Similarly, circle defined by B, Ia, Ic and circle defined by D, Ia, Ic; common external tangents meet at Y.  
- Goal: Prove ∠XIY = 90°.  
- Theme: Properties arising from incenters and tangent circles in a tangential quadrilateral for a perpendicular angle condition.  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
- **Modify quadrilateral specification**: Replace the general tangential quadrilateral with specific numerical side lengths satisfying AB + CD = AD + BC (e.g., AB = 6, BC = 5, CD = 4, DA = 5) and a specific angle (e.g., ∠ABC = 60°) to determine the shape uniquely, adding concrete constraints.  
- **Introduce coordinate system**: Assign fixed coordinates to points A and B on the plane (A at (0,0), B at (6,0)), requiring computation of C and D from the angle and side lengths, and subsequently compute all other points (I, Ia, Ib, Ic, Id), increasing complexity through coordinate geometry.  
- **Change output to computation**: Instead of proving ∠XIY = 90°, compute the numerical distance XY, which requires finding the positions of X and Y via circle equations and tangent intersections, and their distance, shifting from a proof to a numerical calculation.  
- **Increase complexity**: By combining geometry with algebra and trigonometry to handle coordinate calculations for points, circles, tangents, and distance, ensuring the problem remains coherent with the original theme but demands multi-step computation.

Let the incircles of triangles $A B C$ and $A C D$ be tangent to the line $A C$ at $T$ and $T^{\\prime}$, respectively. (See the figure to the left.) We have $A T=\\frac{A B+A C-B C}{2}$ in triangle $A B C, A T^{\\prime}=$ $\\frac{A D+A C-C D}{2}$ in triangle $A C D$, and $A B-B C=A D-C D$ in quadrilateral $A B C D$, so\n\n$$\nA T=\\frac{A C+A B-B C}{2}=\\frac{A C+A D-C D}{2}=A T^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nThis shows $T=T^{\\prime}$. As an immediate consequence, $I_{b} I_{d} \\perp A C$.\n\nThe second statement can be shown analogously.\n<img_3666>\n\nClaim 2. The points $O_{a}, O_{b}, O_{c}$ and $O_{d}$ lie on the lines $A I, B I, C I$ and $D I$, respectively.\n\nProof. By symmetry it suffices to prove the claim for $O_{a}$. (See the figure to the right above.)\n\nNotice first that the incircles of triangles $A B C$ and $A C D$ can be obtained from the incircle of the quadrilateral $A B C D$ with homothety centers $B$ and $D$, respectively, and homothety factors less than 1 , therefore the points $I_{b}$ and $I_{d}$ lie on the line segments $B I$ and $D I$, respectively.\n\nAs is well-known, in every triangle the altitude and the diameter of the circumcircle starting from the same vertex are symmetric about the angle bisector. By Claim 1, in triangle $A I_{d} I_{b}$, the segment $A T$ is the altitude starting from $A$. Since the foot $T$ lies inside the segment $I_{b} I_{d}$, the circumcenter $O_{a}$ of triangle $A I_{d} I_{b}$ lies in the angle domain $I_{b} A I_{d}$ in such a way that $\\angle I_{b} A T=\\angle O_{a} A I_{d}$. The points $I_{b}$ and $I_{d}$ are the incenters of triangles $A B C$ and $A C D$, so the lines $A I_{b}$ and $A I_{d}$ bisect the angles $\\angle B A C$ and $\\angle C A D$, respectively. Then\n\n$$\n\\angle O_{a} A D=\\angle O_{a} A I_{d}+\\angle I_{d} A D=\\angle I_{b} A T+\\angle I_{d} A D=\\frac{1}{2} \\angle B A C+\\frac{1}{2} \\angle C A D=\\frac{1}{2} \\angle B A D\n$$\n\nso $O_{a}$ lies on the angle bisector of $\\angle B A D$, that is, on line $A I$.\n\nThe point $X$ is the external similitude center of $\\omega_{a}$ and $\\omega_{c}$; let $U$ be their internal similitude center. The points $O_{a}$ and $O_{c}$ lie on the perpendicular bisector of the common chord $I_{b} I_{d}$ of $\\omega_{a}$ and $\\omega_{c}$, and the two similitude centers $X$ and $U$ lie on the same line; by Claim 2, that line is parallel to $A C$.\n\n\n\n<img_3882>\n\nFrom the similarity of the circles $\\omega_{a}$ and $\\omega_{c}$, from $O_{a} I_{b}=O_{a} I_{d}=O_{a} A=r_{a}$ and $O_{c} I_{b}=$ $O_{c} I_{d}=O_{c} C=r_{c}$, and from $A C \\| O_{a} O_{c}$ we can see that\n\n$$\n\\frac{O_{a} X}{O_{c} X}=\\frac{O_{a} U}{O_{c} U}=\\frac{r_{a}}{r_{c}}=\\frac{O_{a} I_{b}}{O_{c} I_{b}}=\\frac{O_{a} I_{d}}{O_{c} I_{d}}=\\frac{O_{a} A}{O_{c} C}=\\frac{O_{a} I}{O_{c} I}\n$$\n\nSo the points $X, U, I_{b}, I_{d}, I$ lie on the Apollonius circle of the points $O_{a}, O_{c}$ with ratio $r_{a}: r_{c}$. In this Apollonius circle $X U$ is a diameter, and the lines $I U$ and $I X$ are respectively the internal and external bisectors of $\\angle O_{a} I O_{c}=\\angle A I C$, according to the angle bisector theorem. Moreover, in the Apollonius circle the diameter $U X$ is the perpendicular bisector of $I_{b} I_{d}$, so the lines $I X$ and $I U$ are the internal and external bisectors of $\\angle I_{b} I I_{d}=\\angle B I D$, respectively.\n\nRepeating the same argument for the points $B, D$ instead of $A, C$, we get that the line $I Y$ is the internal bisector of $\\angle A I C$ and the external bisector of $\\angle B I D$. Therefore, the lines $I X$ and $I Y$ respectively are the internal and external bisectors of $\\angle B I D$, so they are perpendicular.']"
1830,"Let $p \geqslant 2$ be a prime number. Eduardo and Fernando play the following game making moves alternately: in each move, the current player chooses an index $i$ in the set $\{0,1, \ldots, p-1\}$ that was not chosen before by either of the two players and then chooses an element $a_{i}$ of the set $\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$. Eduardo has the first move. The game ends after all the indices $i \in\{0,1, \ldots, p-1\}$ have been chosen. Then the following number is computed:

$$
M=a_{0}+10 \cdot a_{1}+\cdots+10^{p-1} \cdot a_{p-1}=\sum_{j=0}^{p-1} a_{j} \cdot 10^{j}
$$

The goal of Eduardo is to make the number $M$ divisible by $p$, and the goal of Fernando is to prevent this.

Prove that Eduardo has a winning strategy.",Extraction Failed,,success,345.3,"[""We say that a player makes the move $\\left(i, a_{i}\\right)$ if he chooses the index $i$ and then the element $a_{i}$ of the set $\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\\}$ in this move.\n\nIf $p=2$ or $p=5$ then Eduardo chooses $i=0$ and $a_{0}=0$ in the first move, and wins, since, independently of the next moves, $M$ will be a multiple of 10 .\n\nNow assume that the prime number $p$ does not belong to $\\{2,5\\}$. Eduardo chooses $i=p-1$ and $a_{p-1}=0$ in the first move. By Fermat's Little Theorem, $\\left(10^{(p-1) / 2}\\right)^{2}=10^{p-1} \\equiv 1(\\bmod p)$, so $p \\mid\\left(10^{(p-1) / 2}\\right)^{2}-1=\\left(10^{(p-1) / 2}+1\\right)\\left(10^{(p-1) / 2}-1\\right)$. Since $p$ is prime, either $p \\mid 10^{(p-1) / 2}+1$ or $p \\mid 10^{(p-1) / 2}-1$. Thus we have two cases:\n\nCase a: $10^{(p-1) / 2} \\equiv-1(\\bmod p)$\n\nIn this case, for each move $\\left(i, a_{i}\\right)$ of Fernando, Eduardo immediately makes the move $\\left(j, a_{j}\\right)=$ $\\left(i+\\frac{p-1}{2}, a_{i}\\right)$, if $0 \\leqslant i \\leqslant \\frac{p-3}{2}$, or $\\left(j, a_{j}\\right)=\\left(i-\\frac{p-1}{2}, a_{i}\\right)$, if $\\frac{p-1}{2} \\leqslant i \\leqslant p-2$. We will have $10^{j} \\equiv-10^{i}$ $(\\bmod p)$, and so $a_{j} \\cdot 10^{j}=a_{i} \\cdot 10^{j} \\equiv-a_{i} \\cdot 10^{i}(\\bmod p)$. Notice that this move by Eduardo is always possible. Indeed, immediately before a move by Fernando, for any set of the type $\\{r, r+(p-1) / 2\\}$ with $0 \\leqslant r \\leqslant(p-3) / 2$, either no element of this set was chosen as an index by the players in the previous moves or else both elements of this set were chosen as indices by the players in the previous moves. Therefore, after each of his moves, Eduardo always makes the sum of the numbers $a_{k} \\cdot 10^{k}$ corresponding to the already chosen pairs $\\left(k, a_{k}\\right)$ divisible by $p$, and thus wins the game.\n\nCase b: $10^{(p-1) / 2} \\equiv 1(\\bmod p)$\n\nIn this case, for each move $\\left(i, a_{i}\\right)$ of Fernando, Eduardo immediately makes the move $\\left(j, a_{j}\\right)=$ $\\left(i+\\frac{p-1}{2}, 9-a_{i}\\right)$, if $0 \\leqslant i \\leqslant \\frac{p-3}{2}$, or $\\left(j, a_{j}\\right)=\\left(i-\\frac{p-1}{2}, 9-a_{i}\\right)$, if $\\frac{p-1}{2} \\leqslant i \\leqslant p-2$. The same argument as above shows that Eduardo can always make such move. We will have $10^{j} \\equiv 10^{i}$ $(\\bmod p)$, and so $a_{j} \\cdot 10^{j}+a_{i} \\cdot 10^{i} \\equiv\\left(a_{i}+a_{j}\\right) \\cdot 10^{i}=9 \\cdot 10^{i}(\\bmod p)$.

- **Variables**: Finite set \(S\) of irreducible lattice points (pairs \((x, y)\) with \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\)).  
- **Conditions**: Existence of a homogeneous polynomial \(f(x, y)\) with integer coefficients, degree \(\geq 1\), satisfying \(f(x, y) = 1\) for all \((x, y) \in S\).  
- **Theme**: Relating sets of coprime integer pairs to algebraic properties of homogeneous polynomials via evaluation constraints.  
- **Complexity Increasors**: Abstract set \(S\) can be specified and tuned to necessitate computational problem-solving (e.g., minimal degree calculation).  
- **Mathematical Depth**: The proof-based structure relies on existence arguments (e.g., interpolation, CRT); transitioning to computation requires degree minimization over complex \(S\).

---

**Step 2: Plan to Increase Complexity:**

1. **Replace Arbitrary Set with Specific, Computationally Intensive Set**: Define \(S\) concretely as expensive to handle yet canonical—e.g., \(\{(p, 1) : p \text{ prime }, p \leq k\} \cup \{(1, p) : p \text{ prime }, p \leq k\} \cup \{(1,1)\}\) for \(k=7\), yielding 13 points with irregular structure.  
   - **Why?**: Challenges include prime counting \(\pi(7)=4\) (primes: 2,3,5,7), with symmetry complicating linear systems. Requires sophisticated elimination and Gröbner basis tools for integer solutions.  

2. **Demand Minimal Degree Instead of Existence**: Task requires minimal \(d\) such that a homogeneous \(f\) meeting conditions exists—optimization replaced proofs.  
   - **Why?**: Tests ability to combine prime theory, linear algebra moduli, and polynomial identities, guaranteeing NP-hard tendencies in coefficient search.  

3. **Incorporate New Constraint—Prime Power Divisor Avoidance**: Restrict \(f\) against vanishment at coprime pair \((\alpha,\beta)\) with small coefficients, deepening Diophantine difficulty.  
   - **Why?**: Eliminates ad hoc coefficient tuning, forcing CRT-analytic methods while preserving goal \(f=1\) at \(S\).  

4. **Maintain Cohesion**: Degree \(d\) depends on \(|S|=2\pi(k)+1=9\) for \(k=7\) (since \(S\) includes \((1,1)\) and symmetry doubles primes), pushing \(d \geq 8\). Parameter \(k\) grounds complexity in open number theory.  
   - **Avoid Triviality**: \(k=7\) exceeds hand calculation feasible only via structured algorithms (no small cases).

Then $I_{i}(x, y)^{N-(n-1)} g_{i}(x, y)$ satisfies both of the above properties and has degree $N$.\n\nWe may now reduce the problem to the following claim:\n\nClaim: For each positive integer a, there is a homogenous polynomial $f_{a}(x, y)$, with integer coefficients, of degree at least 1 , such that $f_{a}(x, y) \\equiv 1(\\bmod a)$ for all relatively prime $(x, y)$.\n\nTo see that this claim solves the problem, take $a$ to be the least common multiple of the numbers $a_{i}(1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n)$. Take $f_{a}$ given by the claim, choose some power $f_{a}(x, y)^{k}$ that has degree at least $n-1$, and subtract appropriate multiples of the $g_{i}$ constructed above to obtain the desired polynomial.\n\nWe prove the claim by factoring $a$.

**Step 2**
#Plan#:
1. Modify the functional argument: Instead of $f(n^2, p)$, use $f(n^3 + n, p)$, which adds complexity by introducing a cubic term and a linear term, altering the residue distribution modulo $p$ and requiring binomial expansion.
2. Add a restrictive condition: Require $f$ to satisfy an additional multiplicative property, $f(ab, p) = f(a,p) f(b,p)$ when all pairs are coprime, embedding multiplicative function theory, which must coexist with existing properties.
3. Change the output request: Demand the exact integer value of $\sum_{n=1}^{p-1} f(n^{3} + n, p)$ for a specific large prime $p = 10^9 + 7$, converting the inequality proof into a precise computation that must handle massive integers and residue patterns.

Suppose a function $f: \mathbb{Z}_{>0} \times \mathbb{Z}_{>0} \rightarrow\{0,1\}$ satisfies $f(1,1)=0$, $f(a,b)+f(b,a)=1$ for relatively prime positive integers $(a,b)$ not both equal to 1, $f(a+b,b)=f(a,b)$ for any coprime $(a,b)$, and $f(ab, p) = f(a,p) f(b,p)$ when all pairs are coprime. Compute exactly $\sum_{n=1}^{p-1} f(n^{3} + n, p)$.",success,223.42,"['Denote by $\\mathbb{A}$ the set of all pairs of coprime positive integers. Notice that for every $(a, b) \\in \\mathbb{A}$ there exists a pair $(u, v) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ with $u a+v b=1$. Moreover, if $\\left(u_{0}, v_{0}\\right)$ is one such pair, then all such pairs are of the form $(u, v)=\\left(u_{0}+k b, v_{0}-k a\\right)$, where $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. So there exists a unique such pair $(u, v)$ with $-b / 2<u \\leqslant b / 2$; we denote this pair by $(u, v)=g(a, b)$.\n\nLemma. Let $(a, b) \\in \\mathbb{A}$ and $(u, v)=g(a, b)$. Then $f(a, b)=1 \\Longleftrightarrow u>0$.\n\nProof. We induct on $a+b$. The base case is $a+b=2$. In this case, we have that $a=b=1$, $g(a, b)=g(1,1)=(0,1)$ and $f(1,1)=0$, so the claim holds.\n\nAssume now that $a+b>2$, and so $a \\neq b$, since $a$ and $b$ are coprime. Two cases are possible. Case 1: $a>b$.\n\nNotice that $g(a-b, b)=(u, v+u)$, since $u(a-b)+(v+u) b=1$ and $u \\in(-b / 2, b / 2]$. Thus $f(a, b)=1 \\Longleftrightarrow f(a-b, b)=1 \\Longleftrightarrow u>0$ by the induction hypothesis.\n\nCase 2: $a<b$. (Then, clearly, $b \\geqslant 2$.)\n\nNow we estimate $v$. Since $v b=1-u a$, we have\n\n$$\n1+\\frac{a b}{2}>v b \\geqslant 1-\\frac{a b}{2}, \\quad \\text { so } \\quad \\frac{1+a}{2} \\geqslant \\frac{1}{b}+\\frac{a}{2}>v \\geqslant \\frac{1}{b}-\\frac{a}{2}>-\\frac{a}{2}\n$$\n\nThus $1+a>2 v>-a$, so $a \\geqslant 2 v>-a$, hence $a / 2 \\geqslant v>-a / 2$, and thus $g(b, a)=(v, u)$.\n\nObserve that $f(a, b)=1 \\Longleftrightarrow f(b, a)=0 \\Longleftrightarrow f(b-a, a)=0$. We know from Case 1 that $g(b-a, a)=(v, u+v)$. We have $f(b-a, a)=0 \\Longleftrightarrow v \\leqslant 0$ by the inductive hypothesis. Then, since $b>a \\geqslant 1$ and $u a+v b=1$, we have $v \\leqslant 0 \\Longleftrightarrow u>0$, and we are done.\n\nThe Lemma proves that, for all $(a, b) \\in \\mathbb{A}, f(a, b)=1$ if and only if the inverse of $a$ modulo $b$, taken in $\\{1,2, \\ldots, b-1\\}$, is at most $b / 2$. Then, for any odd prime $p$ and integer $n$ such that $n \\not \\equiv 0(\\bmod p), f\\left(n^{2}, p\\right)=1$ iff the inverse of $n^{2} \\bmod p$ is less than $p / 2$.

 'We provide a different proof for the Lemma. For this purpose, we use continued fractions to find $g(a, b)=(u, v)$ explicitly.\n\nThe function $f$ is completely determined on $\\mathbb{A}$ by the following\n\nClaim. Represent $a / b$ as a continued fraction; that is, let $a_{0}$ be an integer and $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{k}$ be positive integers such that $a_{k} \\geqslant 2$ and\n\n$$\n\\frac{a}{b}=a_{0}+\\frac{1}{a_{1}+\\frac{1}{a_{2}+\\frac{1}{\\cdots+\\frac{1}{a_{k}}}}}=\\left[a_{0} ; a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{k}\\right] .\n$$\n\nThen $f(a, b)=0 \\Longleftrightarrow k$ is even.\n\nProof. We induct on $b$. If $b=1$, then $a / b=[a]$ and $k=0$. Then, for $a \\geqslant 1$, an easy induction shows that $f(a, 1)=f(1,1)=0$.\n\nNow consider the case $b>1$. Perform the Euclidean division $a=q b+r$, with $0 \\leqslant r<b$. We have $r \\neq 0$ because $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)=1$. Hence\n\n$$\nf(a, b)=f(r, b)=1-f(b, r), \\quad \\frac{a}{b}=\\left[q ; a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{k}\\right], \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\frac{b}{r}=\\left[a_{1} ; a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{k}\\right]\n$$\n\nThen the number of terms in the continued fraction representations of $a / b$ and $b / r$ differ by one. Since $r<b$, the inductive hypothesis yields\n\n$$\nf(b, r)=0 \\Longleftrightarrow k-1 \\text { is even, }\n$$\n\nand thus\n\n$$\nf(a, b)=0 \\Longleftrightarrow f(b, r)=1 \\Longleftrightarrow k-1 \\text { is odd } \\Longleftrightarrow k \\text { is even. }\n$$\n\nNow we use the following well-known properties of continued fractions to prove the Lemma:\n\nLet $p_{i}$ and $q_{i}$ be coprime positive integers with $\\left[a_{0} ; a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{i}\\right]=p_{i} / q_{i}$, with the notation borrowed from the Claim. In particular, $a / b=\\left[a_{0} ; a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{k}\\right]=p_{k} / q_{k}$. Assume that $k>0$ and define $q_{-1}=0$ if necessary. Then\n\n- $q_{k}=a_{k} q_{k-1}+q_{k-2}$, and\n- $a q_{k-1}-b p_{k-1}=p_{k} q_{k-1}-q_{k} p_{k-1}=(-1)^{k-1}$.\n\nAssume that $k>0$. Then $a_{k} \\geqslant 2$, and\n\n$$\nb=q_{k}=a_{k} q_{k-1}+q_{k-2} \\geqslant a_{k} q_{k-1} \\geqslant 2 q_{k-1} \\Longrightarrow q_{k-1} \\leqslant \\frac{b}{2}\n$$\n\nwith strict inequality for $k>1$, and\n\n$$\n(-1)^{k-1} q_{k-1} a+(-1)^{k} p_{k-1} b=1\n$$\n\nNow we finish the proof of the Lemma. It is immediate for $k=0$. If $k=1$, then $(-1)^{k-1}=1$, so\n\n$$\n-b / 2<0 \\leqslant(-1)^{k-1} q_{k-1} \\leqslant b / 2 .\n$$\n\nIf $k>1$, we have $q_{k-1}<b / 2$, so\n\n$$\n-b / 2<(-1)^{k-1} q_{k-1}<b / 2\n$$\n\nThus, for any $k>0$, we find that $g(a, b)=\\left((-1)^{k-1} q_{k-1},(-1)^{k} p_{k-1}\\right)$, and so\n\n$$\nf(a, b)=1 \\Longleftrightarrow k \\text { is odd } \\Longleftrightarrow u=(-1)^{k-1} q_{k-1}>0 .\n$$']"

1.  **Proof to Computation:** Replace the existence proof requirement with computing a *specific* value derived from the fractions satisfying the conditions.
2.  **Strengthen Conditions:** Add constraints `a` and `b` coprime (`gcd(a, b) = 1`) and enforce the approximation error bound `|a/b - √n| < 1/(b(√n + 1))` for non-triviality.
3.  **Introduce Combinatorial Element:** Calculate the **minimum** positive integer `k` for which the `digit-sum(a) + digit-sum(b)` is congruent to `(n^k mod 100)` modulo `digit-sum(gcd(a,b))` (where `gcd` condition is redundant due to coprimality; leverage this redundancy). This k depends crucially on `n` and the specific fraction chosen.
4.  **Exploit Redundancy:** The `gcd(a,b) = 1` condition forces `digit-sum(gcd(a,b)) = digit-sum(1) = 1`, making the congruence `digit-sum(a) + digit-sum(b) ≡ (n^k mod 100) mod 1` technically trivial (always true).
