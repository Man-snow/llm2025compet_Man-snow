- Fixed values: 20 distinct positive integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{20}$.
- Congruence condition: For each $k=1,2,\ldots,20$, $N \equiv a_k \pmod{k}$.
- Moves: Sergey queries a set $S \subseteq \{1,2,\ldots,20\}$, and receives the set $\{a_k : k \in S\}$ without indices.
- Objective: Number of moves for Sergey to guarantee determining $N$.
- Theme: Modular arithmetic reconstruction from incomplete information.

Step 2
#Plan#:
- Increase the number of fixed values from 20 to 30 to handle more variables.
- Reduce the upper bound of $N$ from 5000 to 500 to tighten the constraint and increase sensitivity to moduli.
- Add a query size restriction: Sergey can only ask for subsets of size at most 4 to limit information per move.
- Introduce non-consecutive moduli for complexity: Use $m_i = i + 4$ for $i=1$ to $30$ (i.e., moduli from 5 to 34) to avoid small moduli issues and ensure distinct residues.

3. Introduce aspect ratio constraint: require the rectangle to have aspect ratio between $1/r$ and $r$ for a given $r > 1$, adding a parameter that affects $\mu$.  
4. Ensure logical connections: Higher point density raises the threshold for isolation; no collinearity simplifies area calculations but tightens configurations; aspect ratio restricts rectangle shapes, deepening geometric dependency.

Consequently, if $k$ is odd we have $1=\\sum_{i=0}^{(k-1) / 2}\\left(t_{2 i+2}-t_{2 i}\\right)<\\lambda\\left(1+\\frac{k-1}{2}\\right)<1$; if $k$ is even, we have $1<1+t_{k}-t_{k-1}=$ $\\sum_{i=0}^{k / 2-1}\\left(t_{2 i+2}-t_{2 i}\\right)+\\left(t_{k+1}-t_{k-1}\\right)<\\lambda\\left(1+\\frac{k}{2}\\right)<1$. A contradiction in either case.\n\n\n\nProof of Lemma 2. Let $I_{0}$, respectively $I_{1}$, be the set of all indices $i$ in the range $2, \\ldots, k-1$ such that $m_{i}$ is even, respectively odd. Clearly, $I_{0}$ and $I_{1}$ form a partition of that range. Since $m_{i} \\geq 2$ if $i$ is in $I_{0}$, and $m_{i} \\geq 1$ if $i$ is in $I_{1}$ (recall that the $m_{i}$ are positive integers),\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}=\\sum_{i \\in I_{0}} m_{i}+\\sum_{i \\in I_{1}} m_{i} \\geq 2\\left|I_{0}\\right|+\\left|I_{1}\\right|=2(k-2)-\\left|I_{1}\\right|, \\quad \\text { or } \\quad\\left|I_{1}\\right| \\geq 2(k-2)-\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}\n\n$$\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\n\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{1}}{2}\\right\\rfloor+\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{i}}{2}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{k}}{2}\\right\\rfloor & \\leq m_{1}+\\left(\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} \\frac{m_{i}}{2}-\\frac{\\left|I_{1}\\right|}{2}\\right)+m_{k} \\\\\n\n& \\leq m_{1}+\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}-(k-2)+\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}\\right)+m_{k} \\\\\n\n& =\\sum_{i=1}^{k} m_{i}-k+2 .\n\n\\end{aligned}\n\n$$']",OE_TO,,,

2.  **Degree Constraint:** Degree must be at most `n`.
3.  **Bound `k`:** Positive integer `k` ? `n`. Fixed for the problem.
4.  **Points:** Requirement for `k+1` distinct integer points `x1, ..., xk+1`.

7.  **Objective:** Find all positive integers `n` satisfying the condition.

**Theme:** Ensuring a specific linear dependence among polynomial evaluations exists for all polynomials of a certain type up to a given degree.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Expand the Polynomial Set:** Instead of applying the condition to every single monic polynomial, require it to hold for every possible *pair* `(P, F)` where `P` is as before (monic, deg?`n`, int coeffs) and `F` is a new distinct monic polynomial (deg?`m`, int coeffs) with `m` being another variable related to `n`. This adds a layer of complexity by introducing dependencies between different polynomials.
2.  **Modify the Condition:** Replace the simple sum equality with a congruence modulo an expression involving `F`. Specifically require `??=?? P(x_i) ? P(x_{k+1}) mod F(a_j)` for each index `j` of the points `a_j`. This introduces multiple simultaneous modular constraints tied to the new polynomial `F` and the evaluation points themselves.

**#Elements Identified#**:  
- **Variables**: \(n > 1\) (integer), \(X\) (\(n\)-element set), \(k\) (number of subsets in a subcollection), and the collection of subsets \(A_1, \dots, A_k\).  
- **Constraints**:  
  - Subsets are distinct, proper (\(A_i \neq X\)), and non-empty.  
  - ""Tight"" defined by:  
    - \(\bigcup A_i \subsetneq X\) (proper union),  
    - No element of \(X\) lies in exactly one \(A_i\).  
  - Goal: Maximize the size of a collection with **no non-empty tight subcollection** (including the whole collection).  
- **Theme**: Extremal set theory with combinatorial constraints.  

### Step 2  
**#Plan#**:  
1. **Introduce real-world constraints and dependencies**:  
   - Assign weights to elements of \(X\), summing to \(W\), and require the weightsum of a tight subcollection's union to be at most \(\lfloor W/2 \rfloor\). This adds computational complexity.  
2. **Concretize and amplify conditions**:  
   - Replace ""no non-empty subcollection"" with ""no subcollection of size \(t\)"" (where \(t \geq 2\) is a new parameter). This scales complexity and links to Ramsey theory.  
   - Enforce pairwise intersections: Require every two subsets in a ""tight"" subcollection to intersect, adding dependency analysis.  
3. **Ensure logical coherence**:  
   - Maintain all original constraints (proper subsets, distinctness) while integrating new variables (\(w_i\), \(t\), \(W\)) with unambiguous definitions.

In other words, there is a single set in $\\mathcal{B}$ covering $x^{\\prime}$ but not $x$. In this case, draw an arrow from $x$ to $x^{\\prime}$.

 'Proceed again by induction on $n$ to show that the cardinality of a collection of proper non-empty subsets of $X$, no subcollection of which is tight, does not exceed $2 n-2$.\n\n\n\nConsider any collection $\\mathcal{B}$ of proper non-empty subsets of $X$ with no tight subcollection (we call such collection good). Assume that there exist $M, N \\in \\mathcal{B}$ such that $M \\cup N$ is distinct from $M, N$, and $X$. In this case, we will show how to modify $\\mathcal{B}$ so that it remains good, contains the same number of sets, but the total number of elements in the sets of $\\mathcal{B}$ increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider a maximal (relative to set-theoretic inclusion) subcollection $\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\mathcal{B}$ such that the set $C=\\bigcup_{A \\in \\mathcal{C}} A$ is distinct from $X$ and from all members of $\\mathcal{C}$. Notice here that the union of any subcollection $\\mathcal{D} \\subset \\mathcal{B}$ cannot coincide with any $K \\in \\mathcal{B} \\backslash \\mathcal{D}$, otherwise $\\{K\\} \\cup \\mathcal{D}$ would be tight. Surely, $\\mathcal{C}$ exists (since $\\{M, N\\}$ is an example of a collection satisfying the requirements on $\\mathcal{C}$, except for maximality); moreover, $C \\notin \\mathcal{B}$ by the above remark.\n\n\n\nSince $C \\neq X$, there exists an $L \\in \\mathcal{C}$ and $x \\in L$ such that $L$ is the unique set in $\\mathcal{C}$ containing $x$. Now replace in $\\mathcal{B}$ the set $L$ by $C$ in order to obtain a new collection $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ (then $\\left|\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}\\right|=|\\mathcal{B}|$ ). We claim that $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ is good.\n\n\n\nAssume, to the contrary, that $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ contained a tight subcollection $\\mathcal{T}$; clearly, $C \\in \\mathcal{T}$, otherwise $\\mathcal{B}$ is not good. If $\\mathcal{T} \\subseteq \\mathcal{C} \\cup\\{C\\}$, then $C$ is the unique set in $\\mathcal{T}$ containing $x$ which is impossible. Therefore, there exists $P \\in \\mathcal{T} \\backslash(\\mathcal{C} \\cup\\{C\\})$. By maximality of $\\mathcal{C}$, the collection $\\mathcal{C} \\cup\\{P\\}$ does not satisfy the requirements imposed on $\\mathcal{C}$; since $P \\cup C \\neq X$, this may happen only if $C \\cup P=P$, i.e., if $C \\subset P$. But then $\\mathcal{G}=(\\mathcal{T} \\backslash\\{C\\}) \\cup \\mathcal{C}$ is a tight subcollection in $\\mathcal{B}$ : all elements of $C$ are covered by $\\mathcal{G}$ at least twice (by $P$ and an element of $\\mathcal{C}$ ), and all the rest elements are covered by $\\mathcal{G}$ the same number of times as by $\\mathcal{T}$. A contradiction. Thus $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ is good.\n\n\n\nSuch modifications may be performed finitely many times, since the total number of elements of sets in $\\mathcal{B}$ increases. Thus, at some moment we arrive at a good collection $\\mathcal{B}$ for which the procedure no longer applies. This means that for every $M, N \\in \\mathcal{B}$, either $M \\cup N=X$ or one of them is contained in the other.\n\n\n\nNow let $M$ be a minimal (with respect to inclusion) set in $\\mathcal{B}$. Then each set in $\\mathcal{B}$ either contains $M$ or forms $X$ in union with $M$ (i.e., contains $X \\backslash M$ ). Now one may easily see that the two collections\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\mathcal{B}_{+}=\\{A \\backslash M: A \\in \\mathcal{B}, M \\subset A, A \\neq M\\}, \\quad \\mathcal{B}_{-}=\\{A \\cap M: A \\in \\mathcal{B}, X \\backslash M \\subset A, A \\neq X \\backslash M\\}\n\n$$\n\n\n\nare good as collections of subsets of $X \\backslash M$ and $M$, respectively; thus, by the induction hypothesis, we have $\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{+}\\right|+\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{-}\\right| \\leq 2 n-4$.\n\n\n\nFinally, each set $A \\in \\mathcal{B}$ either produces a set in one of the two new collections, or coincides with $M$ or $X \\backslash M$. Thus $|\\mathcal{B}| \\leq\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{+}\\right|+\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{-}\\right|+2 \\leq 2 n-2$, as required.'
 'We provide yet another proof of the estimate $|\\mathcal{B}| \\leq 2 n-2$. Consider any collection $\\mathcal{B}$ of proper non-empty subsets of $X$ with no tight subcollection (we call such collection good). Arguing indirectly, we assume that there exists a good collection $\\mathcal{B}$ with $|\\mathcal{B}| \\geq 2 n-1$, and choose one such for the minimal possible value of $n$. Clearly, $n>2$.\n\n\n\nFirstly, we perform a different modification of $\\mathcal{B}$. Choose any $x \\in X$, and consider the subcollection $\\mathcal{B}_{x}=\\{B: B \\in \\mathcal{B}, x \\notin B\\}$. By our assumption, $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ is not tight. As the union of sets in $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ is distinct from $X$, either this collection is empty, or there exists an element $y \\in X$ contained in a unique member $A_{x}$ of $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$. In the former case, we add the set $B_{x}=X \\backslash\\{x\\}$ to $\\mathcal{B}$, and in the latter we replace $A_{x}$ by $B_{x}$, to form a new collection $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$. (Notice that if $B_{x} \\in \\mathcal{B}$, then $B_{x} \\in \\mathcal{B}_{x}$ and $y \\in B_{x}$, so $B_{x}=A_{x}$.)\n\n\n\nWe claim that the collection $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ is also good. Indeed, if $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ has a tight subcollection $\\mathcal{T}$, then $B_{x}$ should lie in $\\mathcal{T}$. Then, as the union of the sets in $\\mathcal{T}$ is distinct from $X$, we should have $\\mathcal{T} \\subseteq \\mathcal{B}_{x} \\cup\\left\\{B_{x}\\right\\}$. But in this case an element $y$ is contained in a unique member of $\\mathcal{T}$, namely $B_{x}$, so $\\mathcal{T}$ is not tight - a contradiction.\n\n\n\nPerform this procedure for every $x \\in X$, to get a good collection $\\mathcal{B}$ containing the sets $B_{x}=X \\backslash\\{x\\}$ for all $x \\in X$. Consider now an element $x \\in X$ such that $\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{x}\\right|$ is maximal. As we have mentioned before, there exists an element $y \\in X$ belonging to a unique member (namely, $B_{x}$ ) of $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$. Thus, $\\mathcal{B}_{x} \\backslash\\left\\{B_{x}\\right\\} \\subset \\mathcal{B}_{y}$; also, $B_{y} \\in \\mathcal{B}_{y} \\backslash \\mathcal{B}_{x}$. Thus we get $\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{y}\\right| \\geq\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{x}\\right|$, which by the maximality assumption yields the equality, which in turn means that $\\mathcal{B}_{y}=\\left(\\mathcal{B}_{x} \\backslash\\left\\{B_{x}\\right\\}\\right) \\cup\\left\\{B_{y}\\right\\}$.\n\n\n\nTherefore, each set in $\\mathcal{B} \\backslash\\left\\{B_{x}, B_{y}\\right\\}$ contains either both $x$ and $y$, or none of them. Collapsing $\\{x, y\\}$ to singleton $x^{*}$, we get a new collection of $|\\mathcal{B}|-2$ subsets of $(X \\backslash\\{x, y\\}) \\cup\\left\\{x^{*}\\right\\}$ containing no tight subcollection.

This follows from the fact that the zero-set of $f$ is very sparse: if $f$ takes on a positive and a negative value, we can move $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ from the negative value to the positive value without ever having them form a regular $2 n$-gon - a contradiction.\n\n\n\nThe strategy for showing $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$ is the following. We will animate the points $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ linearly in a variable $t$; then $g(t)=f\\left(A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}\\right)$ will have degree at most $\\operatorname{deg} f$ (assuming it is not zero). The claim above then establishes that any root of $g$ must be a multiple root, so if we can show that there are at least $n$ roots, we will have shown $\\operatorname{deg} g \\geq 2 n$, and so $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$.\n\n\n\nGeometrically, our goal is to exhibit $2 n$ linearly moving points so that they form a regular $2 n$-gon a total of $n$ times, but not always form one.\n\n\n\nWe will do this as follows. Draw $n$ mirrors through the origin, as lines making angles of $\\frac{\\pi}{n}$ with each other. Then, any point $P$ has a total of $2 n$ reflections in the mirrors, as shown below for $n=5$. (Some of these reflections may overlap.)\n\n\n\nDraw the $n$ angle bisectors of adjacent mirrors. Observe that the reflections of $P$ form a regular $2 n$ gon if and only if $P$ lies on one of the bisectors.\n\n\n\nWe will animate $P$ on any line $\\ell$ which intersects all $n$ bisectors (but does not pass through the origin), and let $P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{2 n}$ be its reflections. Clearly, these are also all linearly animated, and because of the reasons above, they will form a regular $2 n$-gon exactly $n$ times, when $\\ell$ meets each bisector. So this establishes $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$ for the reasons described previously.\n\n\n\nNow we pass to constructing a polynomial $f$ of degree $2 n$ having the desired property. First of all, we will instead find a polynomial $g$ which has this property, but only when points with sum zero are input. This still solves the problem, because then we can choose\n\n\n\n$$\nf\\left(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}\\right)=g\\left(A_{1}-\\bar{A}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}-\\bar{A}\\right)\n$$\n\n\n\nwhere $\\bar{A}$ is the centroid of $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$. This has the upshot that we can now always assume $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$, which will simplify the ensuing discussion.\n\n\n\n<img_3624>\n\n\n\nWe will now construct a suitable $g$ as a sum of squares. This means that, if we write $g=g_{1}^{2}+g_{2}^{2}+$ $\\cdots+g_{m}^{2}$, then $g=0$ if and only if $g_{1}=\\cdots=g_{m}=0$, and that if their degrees are $d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{m}$, then $g$ has degree at most $2 \\max \\left(d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{m}\\right)$.\n\n\n\nThus, it is sufficient to exhibit several polynomials, all of degree at most $n$, such that $2 n$ points with zero sum are the vertices of a regular $2 n$-gon if and only if the polynomials are all zero at those points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we will impose the constraints that all $\\left|A_{i}\\right|^{2}=x_{i}^{2}+y_{i}^{2}$ are equal. This uses multiple degree 2 constraints.\n\n\n\nNow, we may assume that the points $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ all lie on a circle with centre 0 , and $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$. If this circle has radius 0 , then all $A_{i}$ coincide, and we may ignore this case.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, the circle has positive radius. We will use the following lemma.\n\n\n\nLemma. Suppose that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are complex numbers of the same non-zero magnitude, and suppose that $a_{1}^{k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{k}=0, k=1, \\ldots, n$. Then $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ form a regular $2 n$-gon centred at the origin. (Conversely, this is easily seen to be sufficient.)\n\n\n\nProof. Since all the hypotheses are homogenous, we may assume (mostly for convenience) that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ lie on the unit circle. By Newton's sums, the $k$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are all zero for $k$ in the range $1, \\ldots, n$.\n\n\n\nTaking conjugates yields $a_{1}^{-k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{-k}=0$, $k=1, \\ldots, n$. Thus, we can repeat the above logic to obtain that the $k$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}^{-1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}^{-1}$ are also all zero for $k=1, \\ldots, n$. However, these are simply the $(2 n-k)$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ (divided by $a_{1} \\cdots a_{2 n}$ ), so the first $2 n-1$ symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are all zero. This implies that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ form a regular $2 n$-gon centred at the origin.\n\n\n\nWe will encode all of these constraints into our polynomial. More explicitly, write $a_{r}=x_{r}+y_{r} i$; then the constraint $a_{1}^{k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{k}=0$ can be expressed as $p_{k}+q_{k} i=0$, where $p_{k}$ and $q_{k}$ are real polynomials in the coordinates. To incorporate this, simply impose the constraints $p_{k}=0$ and $q_{k}=0$; these are conditions of degree $k \\leq n$, so their squares are all of degree at most $2 n$.\n\n\n\nTo recap, taking the sum of squares of all of these constraints gives a polynomial $f$ of degree at most $2 n$ which works whenever $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$. Finally, the centroid-shifting trick gives a polynomial which works in general, as wanted.""]",OE_TO,,,

#Elements Identified#:
- **n**: a positive integer.
- **Points**: fixed, distinct on a circle; total \(2n\) points.
- **Action**: split into \(n\) pairs; each pair joined by an oriented arrow.
- **Conditions (good configuration)**:
  1. **Non-crossing**: no two arrows cross.
  2. **Forbidden convex quadrangle**: no arrows \(\overrightarrow{AB}\) and \(\overrightarrow{CD}\) such that \(A, B, C, D\) form a convex quadrangle oriented clockwise.
- **Goal**: count the number of good configurations.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. **Modify the geometric setting**: Change the circle to the vertices of a starlike convex polygon. This increases complexity by introducing variable angular separations and irregularities in point placement, which complicates non-crossing checks and convexity assessments.
2. **Add an orientation constraint for arrows**: Require that all arrows must point in a clockwise orientation around the polygon. This adds a global directional constraint that interacts with convex quadrangles and adjacent point positions.
3. **Introduce a non-nesting condition**: Forbid nested arrows (i.e., no arrow \(\overrightarrow{AB}\) and \(\overrightarrow{CD}\) where \(C\) and \(D\) lie entirely between \(A\) and \(B\) on the shorter arc between them). This adds local geometric constraints and intertwines with the non-crossing condition.
4. **Ensure logical coherence**: The changes should maintain core concepts while adding complexity.

Since each domino covers two cells of different colours, at least $\\lfloor m / 2\\rfloor$ cells are not covered in each of these regions, and the conclusion follows.\n\n\n\n<img_3888>\n\n\n\nFig. 4\n\n<img_3590>\n\n\n\nFig. 5\n\n\n\nTo deal with the remaining case where bad fictitious dominoes are present, we show that an arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement can be transformed into another such with at least as many dominoes, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes. A finite number of such transformations eventually leads to an arrangement of at least as many dominoes all of whose fictitious dominoes are good, and the conclusion follows by the preceding.\n\n\n\nConsider the row of minimal rank containing bad fictitious dominoes - this is certainly not the bottom row - and let $D$ be one such. Let $\\ell$, respectively $r$, be the left, respectively right, cell of $D$ and notice that the cell below $\\ell$, respectively $r$, is the right, respectively left, cell of a domino $D_{1}$, respectively $D_{2}$, in the arrangement.\n\n\n\nIf $\\ell$ is covered by a domino $D_{\\ell}$ in the arrangement, since $D$ is bad and no two dominoes in the arrangement form a square, it follows that $D_{\\ell}$ is vertical. If $r$ were also covered by a domino $D_{r}$ in the arrangement, then $D_{r}$ would also be vertical, and would therefore form a square with $D_{\\ell}-$ a contradiction. Hence $r$ is not covered, and there is room for $D_{\\ell}$ to be placed so as to cover $D$, to obtain a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes. The case where $r$ is covered is dealt with similarly.\n\n\n\nFinally, if neither cell of $D$ is covered, addition of an extra domino to cover $D$ and, if necessary, removal of the domino above $D$ to avoid formation of a square, yields a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has at least as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes. (Figure 5 illustrates the two cases.)'
 ""We present an alternative proof of the bound.\n\n\n\nLabel the rows upwards $0,1, \\ldots, m-1$, and the columns from the left to the right by $0,1, \\ldots, 2 n-1$; label each cell by the pair of its column's and row's numbers, so that $(1,0)$ is the second left cell in the bottom row. Colour the cells chess-like so that $(0,0)$ is white. For $0 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, we say that the $i$ th white diagonal is the set of cells of the form $(2 i+k, k)$, where $k$ ranges over all appropriate indices. Similarly, the ith black diagonal is the set of cells of the form $(2 i+1-k, k)$. (Notice that the white cells in the upper-left corner and the black cells in the upper-right corner are not covered by these diagonals.)\n\n\n\nClaim. Assume that $K$ lowest cells of some white diagonal are all covered by dominoes. Then all these $K$ dominoes face right or up from the diagonal. (In other words, the black cell of any such\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndomino is to the right or to the top of its white cell.) Similarly, if $K$ lowest cells of some black diagonal are covered by dominoes, then all these dominoes face left or up from the diagonal.\n\n\n\nProof. By symmetry, it suffices to prove the first statement. Assume that $K$ lowest cells of the $i$ th white diagonal is completely covered. We prove by induction on $k<K$ that the required claim holds for the domino covering $(2 i+k, k)$. The base case $k=0$ holds due to the problem condition. To establish the step, one observes that if $(2 i+k, k)$ is covered by a domino facing up of right, while $(2 i+k+1, k+1)$ is covered by a domino facing down or left, then these two dominoes form a square.\n\n\n\nWe turn to the solution. We will prove that there are at least $d=\\lfloor m / 2\\rfloor$ empty white cells. Since each domino covers exactly one white cell, the required bound follows.\n\n\n\nIf each of the first $d$ white diagonals contains an empty cell, the result is clear. Otherwise, let $i<d$ be the least index of a completely covered white diagonal. We say that the dominoes covering our diagonal are distinguished. After removing the distinguished dominoes, the board splits into two parts; the left part $L$ contains $i$ empty white cells on the previous diagonals. So, it suffices to prove that the right part $R$ contains at least $d-i$ empty white cells.\n\n\n\nLet $j$ be the number of distinguished dominoes facing up. Then at least $j-i$ of these dominoes cover some cells of (distinct) black diagonals (the relation $m \\leq n$ is used). Each such domino faces down from the corresponding black diagonal - so, by the Claim, each such black diagonal contains an empty cell in $R$. Thus, $R$ contains at least $j-i$ empty black cells.\n\n\n\nNow, let $w$ be the number of white cells in $R$. Then the number of black cells in $R$ is $w-d+j$, and at least $i-j$ of those are empty. Thus, the number of dominoes in $R$ is at most $(w-d+j)-(j-i)=w-(d-i)$, so $R$ contains at least $d-i$ empty white cells, as we wanted to show.""]",OE_TO,,,

#Plan#:
1.  **Explicit Constraint:** Replace the implicit reference ""the condition in part (a)"" with a specific, moderately complex condition. Define that the sequence *after translation* (\(a_n - a_{n-1}\) for \(n \geq 1\)) forms an arithmetic progression. However, explicitly require the cubic relation to hold for *all* integers \(n\).
2.  **Parameter Constraint:** Introduce a divisibility/multiplicity constraint on the linear coefficient \(c\). Specify that \(c\) must be divisible by a specific prime number (e.g., 5) and require finding possible values modulo that prime.
3.  **Result Complexity:** Instead of directly computing \(a_{2015} \cdot a_{2016}\) after finding parameters, require determining the *possible values* of the product *based* on the allowed combinations of \(b, c, d\) under the new constraints, implying solving a system first.
4.  **Scale Down:** Replace large indices 2015, 2016 with smaller, consecutive indices like \(a_2 \cdot a_3\) to reduce unnecessary large calculations without losing mathematical essence or the concept of consecutive terms.
5.  **Ensure Coherence:** All additions are interdependent. The sequence definition and domain are fixed. The explicit translation condition constrains all parameters. The prime constraint on \(c\) adds a layer of modular arithmetic. Solving for possible products based on parameter constraints derived from both explicit conditions requires deeper logical inference.

We will show that $p=0$ or $q=0$.

**#Elements Identified#**:  
- **Function properties**: The function \(f\) is surjective and maps \(\mathbb{N}\) to \(\mathbb{N}\).  
- **Variables**: \(m\) and \(n\) (elements of \(\mathbb{N}\)), and prime \(p\).  
- **Conditions**: For all \(m, n \in \mathbb{N}\) and all primes \(p\), divisibility by \(p\) holds: \(p \mid f(m+n)\) if and only if \(p \mid (f(m) + f(n))\).  
- **Theme**: The problem involves functional equations with a divisibility equivalence condition tied to prime numbers.  

#### Step 2  
**#Plan#**:  
1. **Change function property constraint**: Replace ""surjective"" with ""bijective"" to add injectivity as an additional requirement, reducing the solution space and increasing analytical depth.  
2. **Expand the number of variables**: Introduce a third variable \(k \in \mathbb{N}\) to extend the condition to sums of three elements, requiring that for every \(m, n, k \in \mathbb{N}\) and every prime \(p\), the divisibility equivalence must hold for \(f(m+n+k)\) and the sum \(f(m) + f(n) + f(k)\). This adds complexity by forcing consistency across more variables and relations.  
3. **Modify divisibility equivalence**: Instead of merely requiring equivalence modulo \(p\), strengthen it to require equivalence modulo \(p^2\). Specifically, for all \(m, n \in \mathbb{N}\) and all primes \(p\), \(f(m+n) \equiv f(m) + f(n) \pmod{p^2}\). This introduces higher-order divisibility constraints, making the condition stricter.  
- **Ensure coherence**: All modifications are logically interconnected. Bijectivity ensures the function is fully invertible, complementing the extended condition with three variables. The modulo \(p^2\) condition for two variables refines and tightens the original divisibility equivalence, providing a layered challenge.

We have $p \\mid f(x+(2 x d-x))=f(2 x d)$; moreover, since $d \\mid 2 x d+(y-x)=y+(2 x d-x)$, we get $p \\mid f(y+(2 x d-x))$.

- **Conditions**: Meeting rules (opposite-direction ants turn 90? clockwise, perpendicular or >2 ants don't turn), movement speed constant at 1, ants fall off at edges.  
- **Participants**: Multiple ants placed at midpoints.  
- **Actions**: Movement initiation at time 0, directional changes upon specific collisions, falling off edges.  
- **Processes**: Ant interactions drive directional changes, affecting when they exit the grid.  
- **Theme**: Deterministic movement dynamics on a grid seeking worst-case exit time.  
- **Manipulation Targets**: Grid dimensionality (e.g., rectangular), direction rules (e.g., non-clockwise turns), ant heterogeneity (e.g., variable properties), environmental constraints (e.g., obstacles), or behavior dependencies (e.g., turn delays).  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
- **Modify Grid Dimensionality**: Change from square (m ? m) to rectangular (m ? n), introducing asymmetry and two variables, complicating edge distances and meeting probabilities.  
- **Add Turn Variability**: Replace fixed 90? clockwise turn with a counterclockwise turn if a newly introduced ""turn resistance"" factor r (for each ant, 0 ? r ? 1) exceeds 0.5, requiring tracking per-ant state; this links to initial positions.  
- **Introduce Obstacles**: Place immovable obstacles at unit squares, blocking paths; ants within distance d (d ? m/4) change direction to avoid them instantly, adding spatial dependencies and rerouting.  
- **Integrate Dependencies**: Turn resistance r is determined by r = (x + y)/max(m,n) where (x,y) is initial position, binding grid variables to ant properties. Obstacles and r affect meeting dynamics?e.g., ants may not turn if blocked. Ensure all elements interlock: grid size impacts r and obstacle avoidance, increasing combinatorial reasoning.  

Step 3  
#Rewritten Instruction#:  
Let $m$ and $n$ be positive integers and consider a rectangular grid of $m$ by $n$ unit squares. Some squares contain immovable obstacles, and at time 0, ants (at midpoints of non-obstacle squares) start moving parallel to an edge with speed 1. Each ant has a turn resistance $r = \frac{x + y}{\max(m,n)}$ for its initial position $(x,y)$. When two ants moving in opposite directions meet, both turn $90^\circ$ clockwise if $r \leq 0.5$ or counterclockwise if $r > 0.5$, then continue. If a meeting involves perpendicular directions or more than two ants, no turn occurs. Within distance $d = \lfloor \min(m,n)/4 \rfloor$ of an obstacle, an ant instantly turns $90^\circ$ clockwise to avoid it. Ants fall off at grid edges. Considering all starting positions, obstacles, and directions, determine the latest possible moment the last ant falls off or prove it may not exist.

For all initial setups, find the latest moment the last ant falls off or prove it may not exist.",success,28.26,"['For $m=1$ the answer is clearly correct, so assume $m>1$. In the sequel, the word collision will be used to denote meeting of exactly two ants, moving in opposite directions.\n\nIf at the beginning we place an ant on the southwest corner square facing east and an ant on the southeast corner square facing west, then they will meet in the middle of the bottom row at time $\\frac{m-1}{2}$. After the collision, the ant that moves to the north will stay on the board for another $m-\\frac{1}{2}$ time units and thus we have established an example in which the last ant falls off at time $\\frac{m-1}{2}+m-\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{3 m}{2}-1$. So, we are left to prove that this is the latest possible moment.\n\nConsider any collision of two ants $a$ and $a^{\\prime}$. Let us change the rule for this collision, and enforce these two ants to turn anticlockwise. Then the succeeding behavior of all the ants does not change; the only difference is that $a$ and $a^{\\prime}$ swap their positions. These arguments may be applied to any collision separately, so we may assume that at any collision, either both ants rotate clockwise or both of them rotate anticlockwise by our own choice.\n\nFor instance, we may assume that there are only two types of ants, depending on their initial direction: NE-ants, which move only north or east, and $S W$-ants, moving only south and west. Then we immediately obtain that all ants will have fallen off the board after $2 m-1$ time units. However, we can get a better bound by considering the last moment at which a given ant collides with another ant.\n\nChoose a coordinate system such that the corners of the checkerboard are $(0,0),(m, 0),(m, m)$ and $(0, m)$. At time $t$, there will be no NE-ants in the region $\\{(x, y): x+y<t+1\\}$ and no SW-ants in the region $\\{(x, y): x+y>2 m-t-1\\}$. So if two ants collide at $(x, y)$ at time $t$, we have\n\n$$\nt+1 \\leq x+y \\leq 2 m-t-1\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\n\n\nAnalogously, we may change the rules so that each ant would move either alternatingly north and west, or alternatingly south and east. By doing so, we find that apart from (11) we also have $|x-y| \\leq m-t-1$ for each collision at point $(x, y)$ and time $t$.\n\nTo visualize this, put\n\n$$\nB(t)=\\left\\{(x, y) \\in[0, m]^{2}: t+1 \\leq x+y \\leq 2 m-t-1 \\text { and }|x-y| \\leq m-t-1\\right\\}\n$$\n\nAn ant can thus only collide with another ant at time $t$ if it happens to be in the region $B(t)$. The following figure displays $B(t)$ for $t=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $t=\\frac{7}{2}$ in the case $m=6$ :\n\n<img_3463>\n\nNow suppose that an NE-ant has its last collision at time $t$ and that it does so at the point $(x, y)$ (if the ant does not collide at all, it will fall off the board within $m-\\frac{1}{2}<\\frac{3 m}{2}-1$ time units, so this case can be ignored). Then we have $(x, y) \\in B(t)$ and thus $x+y \\geq t+1$ and $x-y \\geq-(m-t-1)$.

We begin with an example showing that there can exist 3986729 cells carrying the same positive number.\n\n<img_3188>\n\nTo describe it, we number the columns from the left to the right and the rows from the bottom to the top by $1,2, \\ldots, 2011$. We will denote each napkin by the coordinates of its lowerleft cell. There are four kinds of napkins: first, we take all napkins $(52 i+36,52 j+1)$ with $0 \\leq j \\leq i \\leq m-2$; second, we use all napkins $(52 i+1,52 j+36)$ with $0 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq m-2$; third, we use all napkins $(52 i+36,52 i+36)$ with $0 \\leq i \\leq m-2$; and finally the napkin $(1,1)$. Different groups of napkins are shown by different types of hatchings in the picture.\n\nNow except for those squares that carry two or more different hatchings, all squares have the number 1 written into them. The number of these exceptional cells is easily computed to be $\\left(52^{2}-35^{2}\\right) m-17^{2}=57392$.\n\nWe are left to prove that 3986729 is an upper bound for the number of cells containing the same number. Consider any configuration of napkins and any positive integer $M$. Suppose there are $g$ cells with a number different from $M$. Then it suffices to show $g \\geq 57392$. Throughout the solution, a line will mean either a row or a column.\n\nConsider any line $\\ell$. Let $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{52 m-17}$ be the numbers written into its consecutive cells. For $i=1,2, \\ldots, 52$, let $s_{i}=\\sum_{t \\equiv i(\\bmod 52)} a_{t}$. Note that $s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{35}$ have $m$ terms each, while $s_{36}, \\ldots, s_{52}$ have $m-1$ terms each. Every napkin intersecting $\\ell$ contributes exactly 1 to each $s_{i}$;\n\n\n\nhence the number $s$ of all those napkins satisfies $s_{1}=\\cdots=s_{52}=s$. Call the line $\\ell$ rich if $s>(m-1) M$ and poor otherwise.\n\nSuppose now that $\\ell$ is rich. Then in each of the sums $s_{36}, \\ldots, s_{52}$ there exists a term greater than $M$; consider all these terms and call the corresponding cells the rich bad cells for this line. So, each rich line contains at least 17 cells that are bad for this line.\n\nIf, on the other hand, $\\ell$ is poor, then certainly $s<m M$ so in each of the sums $s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{35}$ there exists a term less than $M$; consider all these terms and call the corresponding cells the poor bad cells for this line. So, each poor line contains at least 35 cells that are bad for this line.\n\nLet us call all indices congruent to $1,2, \\ldots$, or 35 modulo 52 small, and all other indices, i.e. those congruent to $36,37, \\ldots$, or 52 modulo 52 , big. Recall that we have numbered the columns from the left to the right and the rows from the bottom to the top using the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, 52 m-17$; we say that a line is big or small depending on whether its index is big or small. By definition, all rich bad cells for the rows belong to the big columns, while the poor ones belong to the small columns, and vice versa.\n\nIn each line, we put a strawberry on each cell that is bad for this line. In addition, for each small rich line we put an extra strawberry on each of its (rich) bad cells. A cell gets the strawberries from its row and its column independently.\n\nNotice now that a cell with a strawberry on it contains a number different from $M$. If this cell gets a strawberry by the extra rule, then it contains a number greater than $M$. Moreover, it is either in a small row and in a big column, or vice versa. Suppose that it is in a small row, then it is not bad for its column. So it has not more than two strawberries in this case. On the other hand, if the extra rule is not applied to some cell, then it also has not more than two strawberries. So, the total number $N$ of strawberries is at most $2 g$.\n\nWe shall now estimate $N$ in a different way. For each of the $2 \\cdot 35 \\mathrm{~m}$ small lines, we have introduced at least 34 strawberries if it is rich and at least 35 strawberries if it is poor, so at least 34 strawberries in any case. Similarly, for each of the $2 \\cdot 17(m-1)$ big lines, we put at least $\\min (17,35)=17$ strawberries. Summing over all lines we obtain\n\n$$\n2 g \\geq N \\geq 2(35 m \\cdot 34+17(m-1) \\cdot 17)=2(1479 m-289)=2 \\cdot 57392\n$$\n\nas desired.'
 'We present a different proof of the estimate which is the hard part of the problem. Let $S=35, H=17, m=39$; so the table size is $2011=S m+H(m-1)$, and the napkin size is $52=S+H$. Fix any positive integer $M$ and call a cell vicious if it contains a number distinct\n\n\n\nfrom $M$. We will prove that there are at least $H^{2}(m-1)+2 S H m$ vicious cells.\n\nFirstly, we introduce some terminology. As in the previous solution, we number rows and columns and we use the same notions of small and big indices and lines; so, an index is small if it is congruent to one of the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, S$ modulo $(S+H)$. The numbers $1,2, \\ldots, S+H$ will be known as residues. For two residues $i$ and $j$, we say that a cell is of type $(i, j)$ if the index of its row is congruent to $i$ and the index of its column to $j$ modulo $(S+H)$. The number of vicious cells of this type is denoted by $v_{i j}$.\n\nLet $s, s^{\\prime}$ be two variables ranging over small residues and let $h, h^{\\prime}$ be two variables ranging over big residues. A cell is said to be of class $A, B, C$, or $D$ if its type is of shape $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right),(s, h),(h, s)$, or $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, respectively. The numbers of vicious cells belonging to these classes are denoted in this order by $a, b, c$, and $d$. Observe that each cell belongs to exactly one class.\n\nClaim 1. We have\n\n$$\nm \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b+c}{2 S H}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nProof. Consider an arbitrary small row $r$. Denote the numbers of vicious cells on $r$ belonging to the classes $A$ and $B$ by $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, respectively. As in the previous solution, we obtain that $\\alpha \\geq S$ or $\\beta \\geq H$. So in each case we have $\\frac{\\alpha}{S}+\\frac{\\beta}{H} \\geq 1$.\n\nPerforming this argument separately for each small row and adding up all the obtained inequalities, we get $\\frac{a}{S}+\\frac{b}{H} \\geq m S$. Interchanging rows and columns we similarly get $\\frac{a}{S}+\\frac{c}{H} \\geq m S$. Summing these inequalities and dividing by $2 S$ we get what we have claimed.\n\nClaim 2. Fix two small residue $s, s^{\\prime}$ and two big residues $h, h^{\\prime}$. Then $2 m-1 \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+v_{s h^{\\prime}}+v_{h h^{\\prime}}$. Proof. Each napkin covers exactly one cell of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$. Removing all napkins covering a vicious cell of this type, we get another collection of napkins, which covers each cell of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$ either 0 or $M$ times depending on whether the cell is vicious or not. Hence $\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M$ napkins are left and throughout the proof of Claim 2 we will consider only these remaining napkins. Now, using a red pen, write in each cell the number of napkins covering it. Notice that a cell containing a red number greater than $M$ is surely vicious.\n\nWe call two cells neighbors if they can be simultaneously covered by some napkin. So, each cell of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ has not more than four neighbors of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$, while each cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ has not more than two neighbors of each of the types $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$. Therefore, each red number at a cell of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $4 M$, while each red number at a cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $2 M$.\n\nLet $x, y$, and $z$ be the numbers of cells of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ whose red number belongs to $(M, 2 M]$, $(2 M, 3 M]$, and $(3 M, 4 M]$, respectively. All these cells are vicious, hence $x+y+z \\leq v_{h h^{\\prime}}$. The red numbers appearing in cells of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ clearly sum up to $\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M$. Bounding each of these numbers by a multiple of $M$ we get\n\n$$\n\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M \\leq\\left((m-1)^{2}-(x+y+z)\\right) M+2 x M+3 y M+4 z M\n$$\n\n\n\ni.e.\n\n$$\n2 m-1 \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+x+2 y+3 z \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+v_{h h^{\\prime}}+y+2 z\n$$\n\nSo, to prove the claim it suffices to prove that $y+2 z \\leq v_{s h^{\\prime}}$.\n\nFor a cell $\\delta$ of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ and a cell $\\beta$ of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ we say that $\\delta$ forces $\\beta$ if there are more than $M$ napkins covering both of them. Since each red number in a cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $2 M$, it cannot be forced by more than one cell.\n\nOn the other hand, if a red number in a $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$-cell belongs to $(2 M, 3 M]$, then it forces at least one of its neighbors of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ (since the sum of red numbers in their cells is greater than $2 M)$. Analogously, an $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$-cell with the red number in $(3 M, 4 M]$ forces both its neighbors of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, since their red numbers do not exceed $2 M$. Therefore there are at least $y+2 z$ forced cells and clearly all of them are vicious, as desired.\n\nClaim 3. We have\n\n$$\n2 m-1 \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b+c}{2 S H}+\\frac{d}{H^{2}}\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nProof. Averaging the previous result over all $S^{2} H^{2}$ possibilities for the quadruple $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}, h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, we get $2 m-1 \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b}{S H}+\\frac{d}{H^{2}}$. Due to the symmetry between rows and columns, the same estimate holds with $b$ replaced by $c$. Averaging these two inequalities we arrive at our claim.\n\nNow let us multiply (2) by $H^{2}$, multiply (II) by $\\left(2 S H-H^{2}\\right)$ and add them; we get\n\n$H^{2}(2 m-1)+\\left(2 S H-H^{2}\\right) m \\leq a \\cdot \\frac{H^{2}+2 S H-H^{2}}{S^{2}}+(b+c) \\frac{H^{2}+2 S H-H^{2}}{2 S H}+d=a \\cdot \\frac{2 H}{S}+b+c+d$.\n\nThe left-hand side is exactly $H^{2}(m-1)+2 S H m$, while the right-hand side does not exceed $a+b+c+d$ since $2 H \\leq S$. Hence we come to the desired inequality.']",OE_TO,,,

- Objective: Find the smallest \( M \) such that any collection of \( M \) distinct flags contains an \( N \)-flag diverse subset.  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
- **Modify flag structure**: Increase the height of the flags from 1 unit to a fixed \( K \geq 2 \) units, making each flag a \( K \times N \) grid with \( K \times N \) fields.  
- **Increase the number of colors**: Change the field color options from two (yellow/blue) to three colors (yellow/blue/red), expanding the flag variety.  
- **Strengthen the diverse set requirement**: Instead of the main diagonal being monochromatic (any single color), require that all diagonal fields be a specific color (e.g., yellow).  
- **Adjust the grid arrangement and diagonal definition**: Due to the increased flag height, the arrangement of \( N \) flags results in a grid with \( KN \) rows and \( N \) columns. The main diagonal is defined as cells \( (i, i) \) for \( i = 1 \) to \( N \), which corresponds to the first \( N \) rows and columns, requiring all these cells to be yellow for diversity.  
Justification: These modifications increase complexity through larger flag dimensions (more fields per flag), additional color choices (more combinatorial possibilities), and stricter conditions (fixed color requirement on the diagonal).

The total number of flags is $5 \\leq r \\ell$, hence one of the factors (say, $r$ ) should be at least 3 . On the other hand, $\\ell, r \\leq 4$, so there are two flags with coinciding right part; let them be $L_{1} R_{1}$ and $L_{2} R_{1}\\left(L_{1} \\neq L_{2}\\right)$.\n\nNext, since $r \\geq 3$, there exist some flags $L_{3} R_{3}$ and $L_{4} R_{4}$ such that $R_{1}, R_{3}, R_{4}$ are distinct.

Finally, the right parts of two of the flags $L_{1} R_{1}, L_{3} R_{3}, L_{4} R_{4}$ can also form a $2 \\times 2$ square with a blue diagonal by (ii). Putting these $2 \\times 2$ squares on the diagonal of a $4 \\times 4$ square, we find a desired arrangement of four flags.\n\nWe are ready to prove the problem statement by induction on $N$; actually, above we have proved the base case $N=4$.

We call the flags with a blue first square good.\n\nConsider all the good flags and remove the first square from each of them. We obtain at least $2^{N-3}+1 \\geq M_{N-1}$ flags of length $N-1$; by the induction hypothesis, $N-1$ of them\n\n\n\ncan form a square $Q$ with the monochrome diagonal. Now, returning the removed squares, we obtain a rectangle $(N-1) \\times N$, and our aim is to supplement it on the top by one more flag.\n\nIf $Q$ has a yellow diagonal, then we can take each flag with a yellow first square (it exists by a choice of the first column; moreover, it is not used in $Q$ ). Conversely, if the diagonal of $Q$ is blue then we can take any of the $\\geq 2^{N-3}+1-(N-1)>0$ remaining good flags. So, in both cases we get a desired $N \\times N$ square.'

#Elements Identified#:  
- Participants: Chess kings (2500) on a chessboard (100?100 grid).  
- Constraints: (i) Mutual exclusion: No two kings share a common vertex (king-attack avoidance); (ii) Row and column sums: Exactly 25 kings per row and per column.  
- Action: Place kings under constraints and count valid arrangements.  
- Theme: Grid-based combinatorial counting with adjacency and row/column sum constraints.  
- Key variables: Fixed board size (100?100), fixed row/column sum (25), total kings (2500), symmetry distinctions (rotations/symmetries considered distinct).

#Plan#:  
1. Increase board size to 200?200 and kings per row/column to 50 to maintain original density (0.25) but scale up computational complexity.  
2. Add centrosymmetry constraint: Placement must be invariant under 180-degree rotation about the center, introducing symmetry considerations and reducing freedom.  
3. Generalize mutual exclusion to a stricter attack condition: No two kings can be within a chess king's move or on the same diagonal (preventing bishop attacks).

Find the number of these arrangements, with rotations and symmetries not fixing centrosymmetry implying distinctness.",success,147.97,"[""Suppose that we have an arrangement satisfying the problem conditions. Divide the board into $2 \\times 2$ pieces; we call these pieces blocks. Each block can contain not more than one king (otherwise these two kings would attack each other); hence, by the pigeonhole principle each block must contain exactly one king.\n\nNow assign to each block a letter $\\mathrm{T}$ or $\\mathrm{B}$ if a king is placed in its top or bottom half, respectively. Similarly, assign to each block a letter $\\mathrm{L}$ or $\\mathrm{R}$ if a king stands in its left or right half. So we define T-blocks, B-blocks, L-blocks, and $R$-blocks. We also combine the letters; we call a block $a T L$-block if it is simultaneously T-block and L-block. Similarly we define TR-blocks, $B L$-blocks, and BR-blocks. The arrangement of blocks determines uniquely the arrangement of kings; so in the rest of the solution we consider the $50 \\times 50$ system of blocks (see Fig. 1). We identify the blocks by their coordinate pairs; the pair $(i, j)$, where $1 \\leq i, j \\leq 50$, refers to the $j$ th block in the $i$ th row (or the $i$ th block in the $j$ th column). The upper-left block is $(1,1)$.\n\nThe system of blocks has the following properties..\n\n$\\left(\\mathrm{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$ If $(i, j)$ is a B-block then $(i+1, j)$ is a B-block: otherwise the kings in these two blocks can take each other. Similarly: if $(i, j)$ is a T-block then $(i-1, j)$ is a T-block; if $(i, j)$ is an L-block then $(i, j-1)$ is an L-block; if $(i, j)$ is an R-block then $(i, j+1)$ is an R-block.\n\n(ii') Each column contains exactly 25 L-blocks and 25 R-blocks, and each row contains exactly 25 T-blocks and 25 B-blocks. In particular, the total number of L-blocks (or R-blocks, or T-blocks, or B-blocks) is equal to $25 \\cdot 50=1250$.\n\nConsider any B-block of the form $(1, j)$. By $\\left(\\mathrm{i}^{\\prime}\\right)$, all blocks in the $j$ th column are B-blocks; so we call such a column $B$-column. By (ii'), we have 25 B-blocks in the first row, so we obtain 25 B-columns. These $25 \\mathrm{~B}$-columns contain $1250 \\mathrm{~B}$-blocks, hence all blocks in the remaining columns are T-blocks, and we obtain 25 T-columns. Similarly, there are exactly 25 L-rows and exactly 25 -rows.\n\nNow consider an arbitrary pair of a T-column and a neighboring B-column (columns with numbers $j$ and $j+1$ ).\n\n<img_3973>\n\nFig. 1\n\n<img_3920>\n\nFig. 2\n\nCase 1. Suppose that the $j$ th column is a T-column, and the $(j+1)$ th column is a Bcolumn. Consider some index $i$ such that the $i$ th row is an L-row; then $(i, j+1)$ is a BL-block. Therefore, $(i+1, j)$ cannot be a TR-block (see Fig. 2), hence $(i+1, j)$ is a TL-block, thus the $(i+1)$ th row is an L-row. Now, choosing the $i$ th row to be the topmost L-row, we successively obtain that all rows from the $i$ th to the 50th are L-rows. Since we have exactly 25 L-rows, it follows that the rows from the 1st to the 25th are R-rows, and the rows from the 26th to the 50th are L-rows.\n\nNow consider the neighboring R-row and L-row (that are the rows with numbers 25 and 26). Replacing in the previous reasoning rows by columns and vice versa, the columns from the 1 st to the 25th are T-columns, and the columns from the 26th to the 50th are B-columns. So we have a unique arrangement of blocks that leads to the arrangement of kings satisfying the condition of the problem (see Fig. 3).\n\n<img_4043>\n\nFig. 3\n\n<img_3321>\n\nFig. 4\n\nCase 2. Suppose that the $j$ th column is a B-column, and the $(j+1)$ th column is a T-column. Repeating the arguments from Case 1, we obtain that the rows from the 1st to the 25th are L-rows (and all other rows are R-rows), the columns from the 1st to the 25th are B-columns (and all other columns are T-columns), so we find exactly one more arrangement of kings (see Fig. 4).""]",OE_TO,,,

Suppose we are given a dissection as in the problem statement. A triangle in the dissection which is odd and isosceles will be called iso-odd for brevity.\n\nLemma. Let $A B$ be one of dissecting diagonals and let $\\mathcal{L}$ be the shorter part of the boundary of the 2006-gon with endpoints $A, B$. Suppose that $\\mathcal{L}$ consists of $n$ segments. Then the number of iso-odd triangles with vertices on $\\mathcal{L}$ does not exceed $n / 2$.\n\nProof. This is obvious for $n=2$. Take $n$ with $2<n \\leq 1003$ and assume the claim to be true for every $\\mathcal{L}$ of length less than $n$. Let now $\\mathcal{L}$ (endpoints $A, B$ ) consist of $n$ segments. Let $P Q$ be the longest diagonal which is a side of an iso-odd triangle $P Q S$ with all vertices on $\\mathcal{L}$ (if there is no such triangle, there is nothing to prove). Every triangle whose vertices lie on $\\mathcal{L}$ is obtuse or right-angled; thus $S$ is the summit of $P Q S$. We may assume that the five points $A, P, S, Q, B$ lie on $\\mathcal{L}$ in this order and partition $\\mathcal{L}$ into four pieces $\\mathcal{L}_{A P}, \\mathcal{L}_{P S}, \\mathcal{L}_{S Q}, \\mathcal{L}_{Q B}$ (the outer ones possibly reducing to a point).\n\nBy the definition of $P Q$, an iso-odd triangle cannot have vertices on both $\\mathcal{L}_{A P}$ and $\\mathcal{L}_{Q B}$. Therefore every iso-odd triangle within $\\mathcal{L}$ has all its vertices on just one of the four pieces. Applying to each of these pieces the induction hypothesis and adding the four inequalities we get that the number of iso-odd triangles within $\\mathcal{L}$ other than $P Q S$ does not exceed $n / 2$. And since each of $\\mathcal{L}_{P S}, \\mathcal{L}_{S Q}$ consists of an odd number of sides, the inequalities for these two pieces are actually strict, leaving a $1 / 2+1 / 2$ in excess. Hence the triangle $P S Q$ is also covered by the estimate $n / 2$. This concludes the induction step and proves the lemma.\n\nThe remaining part of the solution in fact repeats the argument from the above proof. Consider the longest dissecting diagonal $X Y$. Let $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}$ be the shorter of the two parts of the boundary with endpoints $X, Y$ and let $X Y Z$ be the triangle in the dissection with vertex $Z$ not on $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}$. Notice that $X Y Z$ is acute or right-angled, otherwise one of the segments $X Z, Y Z$ would be longer than $X Y$. Denoting by $\\mathcal{L}_{X Z}, \\mathcal{L}_{Y Z}$ the two pieces defined by $Z$ and applying the lemma to each of $\\mathcal{L}_{X Y}, \\mathcal{L}_{X Z}, \\mathcal{L}_{Y Z}$ we infer that there are no more than 2006/2 iso-odd triangles in all, unless $X Y Z$ is one of them. But in that case $X Z$ and $Y Z$ are odd diagonals and the corresponding inequalities are strict. This shows that also in this case the total number of iso-odd triangles in the dissection, including $X Y Z$, is not greater than 1003.\n\nThis bound can be achieved. For this to happen, it just suffices to select a vertex of the 2006-gon and draw a broken line joining every second vertex, starting from the selected one. Since 2006 is even, the line closes. This already gives us the required 1003 iso-odd triangles. Then we can complete the triangulation in an arbitrary fashion.'
 'Let the terms odd triangle and iso-odd triangle have the same meaning as in the first solution.\n\nLet $A B C$ be an iso-odd triangle, with $A B$ and $B C$ odd sides. This means that there are an odd number of sides of the 2006-gon between $A$ and $B$ and also between $B$ and $C$. We say that these sides belong to the iso-odd triangle $A B C$.\n\nAt least one side in each of these groups does not belong to any other iso-odd triangle. This is so because any odd triangle whose vertices are among the points between $A$ and $B$ has two sides of equal length and therefore has an even number of sides belonging to it in total. Eliminating all sides belonging to any other iso-odd triangle in this area must therefore leave one side that belongs to no other iso-odd triangle. Let us assign these two sides (one in each group) to the triangle $A B C$.\n\nTo each iso-odd triangle we have thus assigned a pair of sides, with no two triangles sharing an assigned side. It follows that at most 1003 iso-odd triangles can appear in the dissection.\n\nThis value can be attained, as shows the example from the first solution.']",OE_TO,,,

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Modify Local Constraint Window:** Shrink the consecutive group size argument from $n+1$ to $n$. This makes satisfying the condition stricter; ensuring all $n$ colors appear requires perfect distribution without gaps and interacts more critically with the circular constraint when $m=n$. This is the primary complexity driver.
2.  **Add Global Constraint:** Introduce a condition limiting consecutive occurrences of the same color. Specify that no $k$ consecutive marbles can have the same color, where $k = \lfloor n/2 \rfloor + 1$. This adds an immediate combinatorial restriction, fighting the tighter window and affecting achievable $m$.
3.  **Add Balanced Placement Requirement:** Impose that the color distribution must be proportionally bounded. The frequency of any single color cannot exceed $\lceil 2m/n \rceil$. This forces a global balance throughout the arrangement, beyond the local constraints.
4.  **Modify Arrangement Topology:** Distinguish the coloring further by requiring that no circular rotation of the arrangement (other than the trivial one) satisfies the same constraints simultaneously. This adds a symmetry-breaking condition, demanding specific pattern uniqueness.

- **Theme**: Minimization of a symmetric quadratic form under combinatorial analytic constraints.  

**Step 2**  
**#Plan#:**  
1. **Parametrize the bound**: Replace the fixed bound $-1$ with a variable $-C(n)$, where $C(n) > 0$ is a function of $n$. This forces $K(n)$ to depend on $C(n)$, intensifying the interdependence.  
2. **Strengthen symmetry**: Change ""every permutation"" to ""every cyclic permutation"". This reduces symmetry, but counterbalance by introducing an auxiliary condition requiring the tuple to *minimize* the maximum deviation of these cyclic sums from $-C(n)$.  
3. **Add minimization constraint**: Introduce $L = \max_{\text{cyclic perm}} \left| \sum_{i=1}^n y_i y_{i+1} + C(n) \right|$ (with $y_{n+1} = y_1$), mandating that Shiny tuples minimize $L$. This aligns constraint synergy and injects variational complexity.

- Strengthen the set condition: Replace the condition ""the same set appears in both other groups"" with requiring the multiset of color sets to be identical across all $d$ groups, enforcing multiplicity consistency in set occurrences.

Any other cube $a$ in $X \\cap M_{2}$ corresponds to some $a^{\\prime} \\in Y \\cap Z$ (possibly with $a^{\\prime} \\in X$ ), so there are at most $n$ of them.

Otherwise, pick a non-empty set of colors $\\mathcal{S}$ which corresponds to, say, the boxes $X, Y$ and $Z$ of different orientations.\n\nNow find all cubes in $A$ whose colors are in $\\mathcal{S}$ and make them invisible.

The sets of colors in all the groups for $B$ are the same as the sets for $A$, removing exactly the colors in $\\mathcal{S}$, and no others! Therefore, every nonempty set that appears in one group for $B$ still shows up in all possible orientations (it is possible that an empty set of colors in $B$ only matched $X, Y$ or $Z$ before these were thrown away, but remember we do not require empty sets to match anyway). In summary, $B$ is also strange.\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, we may assume that $B$ has at most $\\frac{(n-1) n(2 n-1)}{6}$ colors. Since there were at most $n^{2}$ different colors in $\\mathcal{S}$, we have that $A$ has at most $\\frac{(n-1) n(2 n-1)}{6}+n^{2}=$ $\\frac{n(n+1)(2 n+1)}{6}$ colors.\n\nFinally, the construction in the previous solution shows a painting scheme (with no invisible cubes) that reaches this maximum, so we are done.']",OE_TO,,,

To increase complexity:  
1. **Change neighborhood shape:** Replace the axis-aligned square neighborhood with a Euclidean disk of radius $n$, making the neighborhood size and shape position-dependent and irregular, as Euclidean lattice point inclusion varies near boundaries.  
2. **Modify loneliness condition:** Replace the simple ""half of |N|"" threshold with a dynamic threshold $\lfloor |N| \cdot \frac{n}{n+1} \rfloor$, which depends on $n$ and varies per point since |N| is position-dependent, introducing fractional adjustments and rounding.

Claim 1 now yields that $p^{\\prime} \\geqslant p$, so $p^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{D}$, as required.\n\nClaim 2 implies that the final set $\\mathcal{F}$ is contained in $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\n4. $\\mathcal{D}$ is stable, and its comfortable points are known. Recall the definitions of $r_{i}$; let $r_{i}^{\\prime}$ be the ray complementary to $r_{i}$. By our definitions, the set $N(O)$ contains no points between the rays $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$, as well as between $r_{i}^{\\prime}$ and $r_{i+1}^{\\prime}$.\n\nClaim 3. In the set $\\mathcal{D}$, all lattice points of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve are comfortable.\n\nProof. Let $p$ be any lattice point of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve, belonging to some segment $d_{i} d_{i+1}$. Draw the line $\\ell$ containing this segment. Then $\\ell \\cap \\mathcal{D}$ contains exactly $k_{i}+1$ lattice points, all of which lie in $N(p)$ except for $p$. Thus, exactly half of the points in $N(p) \\cap \\ell$ lie in $\\mathcal{D}$. It remains to show that all points of $N(p)$ above $\\ell$ lie in $\\mathcal{D}$ (recall that all the points below $\\ell$ lack this property).\n\n\n\nNotice that each vector in $\\mathcal{V}$ has one coordinate greater than $n / 2$; thus the neighborhood of $p$ contains parts of at most two segments of the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve succeeding $d_{i} d_{i+1}$, as well as at most two of those preceding it.\n\nThe angles formed by these consecutive segments are obtained from those formed by $r_{j}$ and $r_{j-1}^{\\prime}$ (with $i-1 \\leqslant j \\leqslant i+2$ ) by shifts; see the Figure below. All the points in $N(p)$ above $\\ell$ which could lie outside $\\mathcal{D}$ lie in shifted angles between $r_{j}, r_{j+1}$ or $r_{j}^{\\prime}, r_{j-1}^{\\prime}$. But those angles, restricted to $N(p)$, have no lattice points due to the above remark. The claim is proved.\n<img_3487>\n\nProof of Claim 3\n\nClaim 4. All the points of $\\mathcal{D}$ which are not on the boundary of $D$ are crowded.\n\nProof. Let $p \\in \\mathcal{D}$ be such a point. If it is to the up-right of some point $p^{\\prime}$ on the curve, then the claim is easy: the shift of $N\\left(p^{\\prime}\\right) \\cap \\mathcal{D}$ by $\\overrightarrow{p^{\\prime} p}$ is still in $\\mathcal{D}$, and $N(p)$ contains at least one more point of $\\mathcal{D}$ - either below or to the left of $p$. So, we may assume that $p$ lies in a right triangle constructed on some hypothenuse $d_{i} d_{i+1}$. Notice here that $d_{i}, d_{i+1} \\in N(p)$.\n\nDraw a line $\\ell \\| d_{i} d_{i+1}$ through $p$, and draw a vertical line $h$ through $d_{i}$; see Figure below. Let $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ be the parts of $\\mathcal{D}$ lying to the left and to the right of $h$, respectively (points of $\\mathcal{D} \\cap h$ lie in both parts).\n\n<img_3424>\n\nNotice that the vectors $\\overrightarrow{d_{i} p}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i+1} d_{i+2}}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i} d_{i+1}}, \\overrightarrow{d_{i-1} d_{i}}$, and $\\overrightarrow{p d_{i+1}}$ are arranged in non-increasing order by slope. This means that $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ shifted by $\\overrightarrow{d_{i} p}$ still lies in $\\mathcal{D}$, as well as $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ shifted by $\\overrightarrow{d_{i+1} p}$. As we have seen in the proof of Claim 3, these two shifts cover all points of $N(p)$ above $\\ell$, along with those on $\\ell$ to the left of $p$. Since $N(p)$ contains also $d_{i}$ and $d_{i+1}$, the point $p$ is crowded.\n\nThus, we have proved that $\\mathcal{D}=\\mathcal{F}$, and have shown that the lattice points on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve are exactly the comfortable points of $\\mathcal{D}$. It remains to find their number.\n\nRecall the definition of $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$ (see Figure on the first page of the solution). Each segment $d_{i} d_{i+1}$ contains $k_{i}$ lattice points different from $d_{i}$. Taken over all $i$, these points exhaust all the lattice points in the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve, except for $d_{1}$, and thus the number of lattice points on the $\\mathcal{V}$-curve is $1+\\sum_{i=1}^{m} k_{i}$. On the other hand, $\\sum_{i=1}^{m} k_{i}$ is just the number of points in $\\mathcal{K}_{n}$, so it equals $n^{2}$. Hence the answer to the problem is $n^{2}+1$.']",OE_TO,,,

#Plan#:
1.  **Variable Circles:** Replace the fixed count (2017) with a variable `n` (number of circles, n ? 2). This forces analysis for general `n` and consideration of how the answer depends on it.
2.  **Varying Circle Radii:** Introduce the condition that circles have **arbitrary positive sizes**. Tangents now depend on relative sizes and distances (external vs. internal common tangents), drastically increasing geometric complexity and reasoning about valid segments.
3.  **Visibility Constraint:** Add a condition that **a tangent segment can only be drawn if it lies entirely within the unblocked visible regions defined by the current set of segments and circles**. This creates a dependency on the *order* of drawing and forces consideration of ""line-of-sight"" occlusion, making the process highly non-monotonic in terms of available choices. This intertwines with the geometric and connectivity aspects.
4.  **Maintain Core:** Keep the core action (drawing tangents one-by-one under non-intersection constraints until no more can be drawn) and the goal (finding all possible final counts). Preserve ""mutually external"", ""no two tangent"", ""no three concurrent tangents"".

Then the only tangent segments that can be drawn are between adjacent circles $C_{i}$ and $C_{i+1}$, and exactly three segments can be drawn for each pair. So Luciano will draw exactly $3(n-1)$ segments in this case.\n\n<img_3497>\n\nFor the general case, start from a final configuration (that is, an arrangement of circles and segments in which no further segments can be drawn). The idea of the solution is to continuously resize and move the circles around the plane, one by one (in particular, making sure we never have 4 circles with a common tangent line), and show that the number of segments drawn remains constant as the picture changes. This way, we can reduce any circle/segment configuration to the particular one mentioned above, and the final number of segments must remain at $3 n-3$.\n\nSome preliminary considerations: look at all possible tangent segments joining any two circles. A segment that is tangent to a circle $A$ can do so in two possible orientations - it may come out of $A$ in clockwise or counterclockwise orientation. Two segments touching the same circle with the same orientation will never intersect each other. Each pair $(A, B)$ of circles has 4 choices of tangent segments, which can be identified by their orientations - for example, $(A+, B-)$ would be the segment which comes out of $A$ in clockwise orientation and comes out of $B$ in counterclockwise orientation. In total, we have $2 n(n-1)$ possible segments, disregarding intersections.\n\nNow we pick a circle $C$ and start to continuously move and resize it, maintaining all existing tangent segments according to their identifications, including those involving $C$. We can keep our choice of tangent segments until the configuration reaches a transition. We lose nothing if we assume that $C$ is kept at least $\\varepsilon$ units away from any other circle, where $\\varepsilon$ is a positive, fixed constant; therefore at a transition either: (1) a currently drawn tangent segment $t$ suddenly becomes obstructed; or (2) a currently absent tangent segment $t$ suddenly becomes unobstructed and available.\n\nClaim. A transition can only occur when three circles $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$ are tangent to a common line $\\ell$ containing $t$, in a way such that the three tangent segments lying on $\\ell$ (joining the three circles pairwise) are not obstructed by any other circles or tangent segments (other than $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$ ). Proof. Since (2) is effectively the reverse of (1), it suffices to prove the claim for (1). Suppose $t$ has suddenly become obstructed, and let us consider two cases.\n\n\n\nCase 1: $t$ becomes obstructed by a circle\n\n<img_3256>\n\nThen the new circle becomes the third circle tangent to $\\ell$, and no other circles or tangent segments are obstructing $t$.\n\nCase 2: $t$ becomes obstructed by another tangent segment $t^{\\prime}$ \n\nWhen two segments $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ first intersect each other, they must do so at a vertex of one of them. But if a vertex of $t^{\\prime}$ first crossed an interior point of $t$, the circle associated to this vertex was already blocking $t$ (absurd), or is about to (we already took care of this in case 1). So we only have to analyze the possibility of $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ suddenly having a common vertex. However, if that happens, this vertex must belong to a single circle (remember we are keeping different circles at least $\\varepsilon$ units apart from each other throughout the moving/resizing process), and therefore they must have different orientations with respect to that circle.\n<img_4010>\n\nThus, at the transition moment, both $t$ and $t^{\\prime}$ are tangent to the same circle at a common point, that is, they must be on the same line $\\ell$ and hence we again have three circles simultaneously tangent to $\\ell$. Also no other circles or tangent segments are obstructing $t$ or $t^{\\prime}$ (otherwise, they would have disappeared before this transition).\n\nNext, we focus on the maximality of a configuration immediately before and after a transition, where three circles share a common tangent line $\\ell$. Let the three circles be $C_{1}, C_{2}, C_{3}$, ordered by their tangent points. The only possibly affected segments are the ones lying on $\\ell$, namely $t_{12}, t_{23}$ and $t_{13}$. Since $C_{2}$ is in the middle, $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ must have different orientations with respect to $C_{2}$. For $C_{1}, t_{12}$ and $t_{13}$ must have the same orientation, while for $C_{3}, t_{13}$ and $t_{23}$ must have the same orientation. The figure below summarizes the situation, showing alternative positions for $C_{1}$ (namely, $C_{1}$ and $C_{1}^{\\prime}$ ) and for $C_{3}\\left(C_{3}\\right.$ and $C_{3}^{\\prime}$ ).\n\n<img_3756>\n\n\n\nNow perturb the diagram slightly so the three circles no longer have a common tangent, while preserving the definition of $t_{12}, t_{23}$ and $t_{13}$ according to their identifications. First note that no other circles or tangent segments can obstruct any of these segments. Also recall that tangent segments joining the same circle at the same orientation will never obstruct each other.\n\nThe availability of the tangent segments can now be checked using simple diagrams.\n\nCase 1: $t_{13}$ passes through $C_{2}$\n\n<img_3220>\n\nIn this case, $t_{13}$ is not available, but both $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ are.\n\nCase 2: $t_{13}$ does not pass through $C_{2}$\n\n<img_3461>\n\nNow $t_{13}$ is available, but $t_{12}$ and $t_{23}$ obstruct each other, so only one can be drawn.\n\nIn any case, exactly 2 out of these 3 segments can be drawn. Thus the maximal number of segments remains constant as we move or resize the circles, and we are done.'
 ""First note that all tangent segments lying on the boundary of the convex hull of the circles are always drawn since they do not intersect anything else. Now in the final picture, aside from the $n$ circles, the blackboard is divided into regions. We can consider the picture as a plane (multi-)graph $G$ in which the circles are the vertices and the tangent segments are the edges. The idea of this solution is to find a relation between the number of edges and the number of regions in $G$; then, once we prove that $G$ is connected, we can use Euler's formula to finish the problem.\n\nThe boundary of each region consists of 1 or more (for now) simple closed curves, each made of arcs and tangent segments. The segment and the arc might meet smoothly (as in $S_{i}$, $i=1,2, \\ldots, 6$ in the figure below) or not (as in $P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, P_{4}$; call such points sharp corners of the boundary). In other words, if a person walks along the border, her direction would suddenly turn an angle of $\\pi$ at a sharp corner.\n\n\n\n<img_3559>\n\nClaim 1. The outer boundary $B_{1}$ of any internal region has at least 3 sharp corners.\n\nProof. Let a person walk one lap along $B_{1}$ in the counterclockwise orientation. As she does so, she will turn clockwise as she moves along the circle arcs, and not turn at all when moving along the lines. On the other hand, her total rotation after one lap is $2 \\pi$ in the counterclockwise direction! Where could she be turning counterclockwise? She can only do so at sharp corners, and, even then, she turns only an angle of $\\pi$ there. But two sharp corners are not enough, since at least one arc must be present - so she must have gone through at least 3 sharp corners.\n\nClaim 2. Each internal region is simply connected, that is, has only one boundary curve.\n\nProof. Suppose, by contradiction, that some region has an outer boundary $B_{1}$ and inner boundaries $B_{2}, B_{3}, \\ldots, B_{m}(m \\geqslant 2)$. Let $P_{1}$ be one of the sharp corners of $B_{1}$.\n\nNow consider a car starting at $P_{1}$ and traveling counterclockwise along $B_{1}$. It starts in reverse, i.e., it is initially facing the corner $P_{1}$. Due to the tangent conditions, the car may travel in a way so that its orientation only changes when it is moving along an arc. In particular, this means the car will sometimes travel forward. For example, if the car approaches a sharp corner when driving in reverse, it would continue travel forward after the corner, instead of making an immediate half-turn. This way, the orientation of the car only changes in a clockwise direction since the car always travels clockwise around each arc.\n\nNow imagine there is a laser pointer at the front of the car, pointing directly ahead. Initially, the laser endpoint hits $P_{1}$, but, as soon as the car hits an arc, the endpoint moves clockwise around $B_{1}$. In fact, the laser endpoint must move continuously along $B_{1}$ ! Indeed, if the endpoint ever jumped (within $B_{1}$, or from $B_{1}$ to one of the inner boundaries), at the moment of the jump the interrupted laser would be a drawable tangent segment that Luciano missed (see figure below for an example).\n\n<img_3484>\n\n\n\nNow, let $P_{2}$ and $P_{3}$ be the next two sharp corners the car goes through, after $P_{1}$ (the previous lemma assures their existence). At $P_{2}$ the car starts moving forward, and at $P_{3}$ it will start to move in reverse again. So, at $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint is at $P_{3}$ itself. So while the car moved counterclockwise between $P_{1}$ and $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint moved clockwise between $P_{1}$ and $P_{3}$. That means the laser beam itself scanned the whole region within $B_{1}$, and it should have crossed some of the inner boundaries.\n\nClaim 3. Each region has exactly 3 sharp corners.\n\nProof. Consider again the car of the previous claim, with its laser still firmly attached to its front, traveling the same way as before and going through the same consecutive sharp corners $P_{1}, P_{2}$ and $P_{3}$. As we have seen, as the car goes counterclockwise from $P_{1}$ to $P_{3}$, the laser endpoint goes clockwise from $P_{1}$ to $P_{3}$, so together they cover the whole boundary. If there were a fourth sharp corner $P_{4}$, at some moment the laser endpoint would pass through it. But, since $P_{4}$ is a sharp corner, this means the car must be on the extension of a tangent segment going through $P_{4}$. Since the car is not on that segment itself (the car never goes through $P_{4}$ ), we would have 3 circles with a common tangent line, which is not allowed.\n\n<img_3207>\n\nWe are now ready to finish the solution. Let $r$ be the number of internal regions, and $s$ be the number of tangent segments. Since each tangent segment contributes exactly 2 sharp corners to the diagram, and each region has exactly 3 sharp corners, we must have $2 s=3 r$. Since the graph corresponding to the diagram is connected, we can use Euler's formula $n-s+r=1$ and find $s=3 n-3$ and $r=2 n-2$.""]",OE_TO,,,

- Add a condition: Introduce the $\gcd$ requirement for $c$ to avoid trivial cases and link $c$ directly to the properties of $b$, increasing interdependence.  
- Reasons: The base generalization complicates termination conditions, the $c$-range modification adds dependency on $b$ and reduces arbitrariness, and the coprimality condition enforces non-trivial periods.

1.  **Add Variables:** Introduce a **third prime `r`** and a **result prime variable `s`**, significantly increasing combinatorial and algebraic complexity.
2.  **Add Real-World Constraint:** Require that `p ? q mod r` or vice versa, linking the primes `p,q` to the new prime `r` through modular arithmetic.
3.  **Concretize Goal:** Replace the simple ""is an integer"" condition with the requirement that the simplified expression equals a **positive prime power** `s^k` (with `s` prime and `k ? 1`)
4.  **Increase Reasoning:** Require the identification of *all* such **tuples** `(p, q, r, s, k)` satisfying the new modular condition and the prime power condition. This integrates all added components.

For these primes, determine if the number `X = [ (p+q)^{p+q}(p-q)^{p-q} - 1 ] / [ (p+q)^{p-q}(p-q)^{p+q} - 1 ]` simplifies to a positive prime power `s^k` (`k ? 1`).

(This imposes significant structural constraints on permissible divisor sets and grid arrangements.)
2.  **Introduce Geometric Condition:** Require that the entire divisor table exhibits rotational symmetry under a specific angle transformation (e.g., values unchanged after 120? rotation). This introduces non-trivial relations between divisors and forces the table shape.
3.  **Add Constraint on Table Dimensions:** Require that the dimensions $r$ and $c$ satisfy a specific arithmetic condition relative to $n$ or its divisor sum. (Ensures $r$ and $c$ aren't just factors of $\tau(n)$, but also meet an extra condition tied to the problem).
4.  **Ensure Integration:** The arithmetic sequence requirement (1) directly interacts with the divisor sum constraints.

- Variables: $n$ (positive integer), $N = 2^{n}$, $x$ (real number), $a_n$ (real number to be minimized).
- Conditions: The inequality must hold for all real $x$; $a_n$ is the smallest constant satisfying the inequality.
- Theme: Finding a minimal constant for an inequality involving generalized means and polynomial approximation, preserving the exponential structure in $n$.
- Participants/actions: The process involves algebraic manipulation and optimization around $x=1$, with potential for adding constraints, generalizing expressions, or introducing dependencies.
Locations for complexity increase: exponent of $x$, the constant denominator, the right-hand side structure, addition of multiple variables or parameters, or constraints on $x$ or equality cases.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. Introduce a second positive integer parameter $k$ to generalize the exponent, replacing $2N$ with $2kN$, making the left-hand side dependent on both $n$ and $k$.
2. Modify the domain of $x$ from all real numbers to $x > 0$ to handle potential issues with negative roots and clarify the scope, adding a constraint.
3. Expand the right-hand side to include a constant term by changing it to $a_{n,k} (x - 1)^2 + c_{n,k} x + d_{n,k}$, with $c_{n,k}$ and $d_{n,k}$ to be determined alongside $a_{n,k}$, introducing optimization over multiple parameters.
Reasoning: Step (1) increases algebraic complexity by varying the exponent; step (2) adds real-world practicality by restricting to a common domain; step (3) enhances reasoning through multivariate optimization while maintaining interconnection (e.g., $a_{n,k}$, $c_{n,k}$, $d_{n,k}$ jointly minimize the constant in the inequality).

#Elements Identified#:
- Variables: n (integer ?2), k (number of cable cars per company).
- Entities: Two cable car companies (A and B) operating cable cars.
- Constraints: Cable cars are strictly ordered by start and end points; for i<j, start j > start i and end j > end i.
- Positioning: Checkpoints are linear and ordered from 1 to n2 bottom to top.
- Reachability: Two points are linked if reachable via one or more cable cars of one company without foot movement.
- Objective: Find the smallest k such that there are always two points linked by both companies.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. Increase the number of companies to a general integer c ? 2 to force the pair to be linked by all companies, adding a dimension.
2. Add a minimum elevation gain: Each cable car must have at least r positions between start and end (F - S ? r), with r a given integer, 1 ? r ? n2, to constrain individual cable car spans and make connectivity less uniform.
3. Relax the ordering constraint: Only starting points are strictly ordered for the cable cars; finishing points are not necessarily ordered with respect to the indices, increasing uncertainty in the system. This modifies the original strict ordering of both start and end points to a partial structure.
4. Ensure all plan components are integrated: The variables (n, c, r) are inputs, the min gain depends on r, and the disordered finishing points interact with the min gain to affect reachability paths, requiring more complex combinatorial analysis for the guarantee.

- Add termination condition: Introduce a new clause (all numbers identical and positive) to terminate, which interacts with the diverse start and min operation for added strategic complexity.

In every round, player $A$ erases two numbers $x$ and $y$ from the blackboard, and then player $B$ writes one of the numbers $x+y$, $|x-y|$, or $\min\{x,y\}$ on the blackboard. The game terminates as soon as, at the end of some round, one of the following holds: (1) one of the numbers on the blackboard is larger than the sum of all other numbers; (2) there are only zeros on the blackboard; (3) all numbers on the blackboard are identical and positive. Player $B$ must then give as many cookies to player $A$ as there are numbers on the blackboard. Player $A$ wants to get as many cookies as possible, whereas player $B$ wants to give as few as possible. Determine the number of cookies that $A$ receives if both players play optimally.",success,114.02,"[""For a positive integer $n$, we denote by $S_{2}(n)$ the sum of digits in its binary representation. We prove that, in fact, if a board initially contains an even number $n>1$ of ones, then $A$ can guarantee to obtain $S_{2}(n)$, but not more, cookies. The binary representation of 2020 is $2020=\\overline{11111100100}_{2}$, so $S_{2}(2020)=7$, and the answer follows.\n\nA strategy for A. At any round, while possible, A chooses two equal nonzero numbers on the board. Clearly, while $A$ can make such choice, the game does not terminate. On the other hand, $A$ can follow this strategy unless the game has already terminated. Indeed, if $A$ always chooses two equal numbers, then each number appearing on the board is either 0 or a power of 2 with non-negative integer exponent, this can be easily proved using induction on the number of rounds. At the moment when $A$ is unable to follow the strategy all nonzero numbers on the board are distinct powers of 2 . If the board contains at least one such power, then the largest of those powers is greater than the sum of the others. Otherwise there are only zeros on the blackboard, in both cases the game terminates.\n\nFor every number on the board, define its range to be the number of ones it is obtained from. We can prove by induction on the number of rounds that for any nonzero number $k$ written by $B$ its range is $k$, and for any zero written by $B$ its range is a power of 2 . Thus at the end of each round all the ranges are powers of two, and their sum is $n$. Since $S_{2}(a+b) \\leqslant S_{2}(a)+S_{2}(b)$ for any positive integers $a$ and $b$, the number $n$ cannot be represented as a sum of less than $S_{2}(n)$ powers of 2 . Thus at the end of each round the board contains at least $S_{2}(n)$ numbers, while $A$ follows the above strategy. So $A$ can guarantee at least $S_{2}(n)$ cookies for himself.\n\nA strategy for $B$. Denote $s=S_{2}(n)$.\n\nLet $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k}$ be the numbers on the board at some moment of the game after $B$ 's turn or at the beginning of the game. Say that a collection of $k \\operatorname{signs} \\varepsilon_{1}, \\ldots, \\varepsilon_{k} \\in\\{+1,-1\\}$ is balanced if\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\varepsilon_{i} x_{i}=0\n$$\n\nWe say that a situation on the board is good if $2^{s+1}$ does not divide the number of balanced collections. An appropriate strategy for $B$ can be explained as follows: Perform a move so that the situation remains good, while it is possible. We intend to show that in this case $B$ will not lose more than $S_{2}(n)$ cookies. For this purpose, we prove several lemmas.\n\nFor a positive integer $k$, denote by $\\nu_{2}(k)$ the exponent of the largest power of 2 that divides $k$. Recall that, by Legendre's formula, $\\nu_{2}(n !)=n-S_{2}(n)$ for every positive integer $n$.\n\n\n\nLemma 1. The initial situation is good.\n\nProof. In the initial configuration, the number of balanced collections is equal to $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n \\\\ n / 2\\end{array}\\right)$. We have\n\n$$\n\\nu_{2}\\left(\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nn \\\\\nn / 2\n\\end{array}\\right)\\right)=\\nu_{2}(n !)-2 \\nu_{2}((n / 2) !)=\\left(n-S_{2}(n)\\right)-2\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-S_{2}(n / 2)\\right)=S_{2}(n)=s\n$$\n\nHence $2^{s+1}$ does not divide the number of balanced collections, as desired.\n\nLemma 2. B may play so that after each round the situation remains good.\n\nProof. Assume that the situation $\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k}\\right)$ before a round is good, and that $A$ erases two numbers, $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$.\n\nLet $N$ be the number of all balanced collections, $N_{+}$be the number of those having $\\varepsilon_{p}=\\varepsilon_{q}$, and $N_{-}$be the number of other balanced collections. Then $N=N_{+}+N_{-}$. Now, if $B$ replaces $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$ by $x_{p}+x_{q}$, then the number of balanced collections will become $N_{+}$. If $B$ replaces $x_{p}$ and $x_{q}$ by $\\left|x_{p}-x_{q}\\right|$, then this number will become $N_{-}$. Since $2^{s+1}$ does not divide $N$, it does not divide one of the summands $N_{+}$and $N_{-}$, hence $B$ can reach a good situation after the round.\n\nLemma 3. Assume that the game terminates at a good situation. Then the board contains at most $s$ numbers.\n\nProof. Suppose, one of the numbers is greater than the sum of the other numbers. Then the number of balanced collections is 0 and hence divisible by $2^{s+1}$. Therefore, the situation is not good.\n\nThen we have only zeros on the blackboard at the moment when the game terminates. If there are $k$ of them, then the number of balanced collections is $2^{k}$. Since the situation is good, we have $k \\leqslant s$.\n\nBy Lemmas 1 and 2, $B$ may act in such way that they keep the situation good. By Lemma 3, when the game terminates, the board contains at most $s$ numbers. This is what we aimed to prove.""]",OE_TO,,,

#Elements Identified#:
- Variables: $n$ (number of coins), $C$ (initial configuration), $\ell(C)$ (steps to termination).
- Coin states: Originally binary (H or T); flipping changes H to T or vice versa.
- Operation: If $k > 0$ heads, flip the $k^{\text{th}}$ coin; else stop.
- Termination: All coins show T.
- Process: Repeated application of the operation until termination.

#Plan#:
1. Expand coin states: Change from binary (H/T) to ternary (H, T, E) to increase state space complexity.
2. Modify the position function: Replace fixed $k^{\text{th}}$ position with $p = [(k + t) \mod n] + 1$, where $t$ is step number, adding time-dependency and modulo arithmetic for asymmetry.
3. Redefine flipping: Cycle state H?T?E?H instead of binary flip, altering state transitions.

5. Update configuration space: Average over $3^n$ instead of $2^n$ configurations.

 'We consider what happens with configurations depending on the coins they start and end with.\n\n- If a configuration starts with $H$, the last $n-1$ coins follow the given rules, as if they were all the coins, until they are all $T$, then the first coin is turned over.\n- If a configuration ends with $T$, the last coin will never be turned over, and the first $n-1$ coins follow the given rules, as if they were all the coins.\n- If a configuration starts with $T$ and ends with $H$, the middle $n-2$ coins follow the given rules, as if they were all the coins, until they are all $T$.

 'Harry has built a Turing machine to flip the coins for him. The machine is initially positioned at the $k^{\\text {th }}$ coin, where there are $k$ heads (and the position before the first coin is considered to be the $0^{\\text {th }}$ coin). The machine then moves according to the following rules, stopping when it reaches the position before the first coin: if the coin at its current position is $H$, it flips the coin and moves to the previous coin, while if the coin at its current position is $T$, it flips the coin and moves to the next position.\n\nConsider the maximal sequences of consecutive moves in the same direction. Suppose the machine has $a$ consecutive moves to the next coin, before a move to the previous coin. After those $a$ moves, the $a$ coins flipped in those moves are all heads, as is the coin the machine is now at, so at least the next $a+1$ moves will all be moves to the previous coin. Similarly, $a$ consecutive moves to the previous coin are followed by at least $a+1$ consecutive moves to\n\n\n\nthe next coin. There cannot be more than $n$ consecutive moves in the same direction, so this proves that the process terminates (with a move from the first coin to the position before the first coin).\n\nThus we have a (possibly empty) sequence $a_{1}<\\cdots<a_{t} \\leqslant n$ giving the lengths of maximal sequences of consecutive moves in the same direction, where the final $a_{t}$ moves must be moves to the previous coin, ending before the first coin. We claim there is a bijection between initial configurations of the coins and such sequences. This gives\n\n$$\nE(n)=\\frac{1}{2}(1+2+\\cdots+n)=\\frac{n(n+1)}{4}\n$$\n\nas required, since each $i$ with $1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n$ will appear in half of the sequences, and will contribute $i$ to the number of moves when it does.\n\nTo see the bijection, consider following the sequence of moves backwards, starting with the machine just before the first coin and all coins showing tails. This certainly determines a unique configuration of coins that could possibly correspond to the given sequence. Furthermore, every coin flipped as part of the $a_{j}$ consecutive moves is also flipped as part of all subsequent sequences of $a_{k}$ consecutive moves, for all $k>j$, meaning that, as we follow the moves backwards, each coin is always in the correct state when flipped to result in a move in the required direction. (Alternatively, since there are $2^{n}$ possible configurations of coins and $2^{n}$ possible such ascending sequences, the fact that the sequence of moves determines at most one configuration of coins, and thus that there is an injection from configurations of coins to such ascending sequences, is sufficient for it to be a bijection, without needing to show that coins are in the right state as we move backwards.)'

- **Structure:** $n$ infinite straight walls, no parallels, no triple points.  
- **Painting:** Merlin paints one side per wall red/blue arbitrarily.  
- **Doors:** Diagonal different-color corners at intersections are doors.  
- **Movement:** Knights traverse doors but not walls.  
- **Problem Scope:** Find $k(\mathfrak{L})$ - the max guaranteed number of knights that *cannot* meet, minimized over Merlin's colorings, for a given wall arrangement ($\mathfrak{L}$).  
- **Output Goal:** Characterize all possible values of $k(\mathfrak{L})$ for all wall labyrinths with $n$ walls.  

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Geometric Complexity:** Replace infinite straight walls with bounded convex polygonal walls intersecting transversely. This creates intersections of higher degree (not just 4) and complex corridors/junctions.  
2.  **Dynamic Connectivity:** Modify the door mechanism. Knights traverse only along an edge (finite wall segment between intersections) that adjoins a region where both its adjacent colored sides satisfy a specific, coloring-dependent rule (e.g., both sides red) rather than simply using ""doors"". Movement depends *locally* on the colors of the two walls defining the edge.  
3.  **Environment State:** Introduce heights/levels ($h: \text{Regions} \to \mathbb{Z}$) such that knights can move from region $A$ to region $B$ only if $|h(A) - h(B)| \leq 1$ *and* the edge traversal condition is met. This adds a controllable, graph-independent constraint.  
4.  **Problem Scope Adaptation:** The core question (max guaranteed unreachable knights) remains the *same*. However, the characterization of $k(\mathfrak{L})$ must now consider the *worst-case* height assignment for the given polygonal wall arrangement $\mathfrak{L}$, *after* Merlin's coloring. Morgana chooses knight placements *and* the height function strategically to maximize the unreachable set, countering Merlin.  

Step 3
#Rewritten Instruction#:
On a flat plane in Camelot, King Arthur builds a labyrinth $\mathfrak{L}$ using $n$ bounded convex polygonal walls. Walls intersect transversely: each pair intersects at most once and no wall passes through another's vertex. Merlin paints one side of each wall entirely red and the other side entirely blue arbitrarily. This partitions the plane into connected regions.

Two adjacent regions share a finite edge $\overline{PQ}$ (a segment bounded by wall intersections $P$ and $Q$) defined by two walls. A knight can traverse from region $A$ to region $B$ across edge $\overline{PQ}$ only if:
1.  The sides immediately adjacent to $A$ along both defining walls are red, **and**
2.  $|h(A) - h(B)| \leq 1$,

where $h: \text{Regions} \to \mathbb{Z}$ is a height function chosen *after* Merlin paints. Knights cannot traverse elsewhere.

Morgana places knights and chooses $h$. Let $k(\mathfrak{L})$ be the largest $k$ such that, no matter how Merlin paints, Morgana can place at least $k$ knights and choose $h$ so no two knights can ever meet. For each $n$, what are all possible values for $k(\mathfrak{L})$, where $\mathfrak{L}$ is any such labyrinth with $n$ walls?

The claim is true for $n=0$ as, when there are no walls, the plane forms a single region. When placing the $n^{\\text {th }}$ wall, it intersects each of the $n-1$ other walls exactly once and hence splits each of $n$ of the regions formed by those other walls into two regions. By the induction hypothesis, this yields $\\left(\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1\\right)+n=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1$ regions, proving the claim.\n\nNow let $G$ be the graph with vertices given by the $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1$ regions, and with two regions connected by an edge if there is a door between them.\n\nWe now show that no matter how Merlin paints the $n$ walls, Morgana can place at least $n+1$ knights. No matter how the walls are painted, there are exactly $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)$ intersection points, each of which corresponds to a single edge in $G$. Consider adding the edges of $G$ sequentially and note that each edge reduces the number of connected components by at most one. Therefore the number of connected components of $\\mathrm{G}$ is at least $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)+1-\\left(\\begin{array}{l}n \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)=n+1$. If Morgana places a knight in regions corresponding to different connected components of $G$, then no two knights can ever meet.\n\nNow we give a construction showing that, no matter what shape the labyrinth is, Merlin can colour it such that there are exactly $n+1$ connected components, allowing Morgana to place at most $n+1$ knights.\n\nFirst, we choose a coordinate system on the labyrinth so that none of the walls run due north-south, or due east-west. We then have Merlin paint the west face of each wall red, and the east face of each wall blue. We label the regions according to how many walls the region is on the east side of: the labels are integers between 0 and $n$.\n\nWe claim that, for each $i$, the regions labelled $i$ are connected by doors. First, we note that for each $i$ with $0 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n$ there is a unique region labelled $i$ which is unbounded to the north.\n\nNow, consider a knight placed in some region with label $i$, and ask them to walk north (moving east or west by following the walls on the northern sides of regions, as needed). This knight will never get stuck: each region is convex, and so, if it is bounded to the north, it has a single northernmost vertex with a door northwards to another region with label $i$.\n\nEventually it will reach a region which is unbounded to the north, which will be the unique such region with label $i$. Hence every region with label $i$ is connected to this particular region, and so all regions with label $i$ are connected to each other.\n\nAs a result, there are exactly $n+1$ connected components, and Morgana can place at most $n+1$ knights.'
 'We give another description of a strategy for Merlin to paint the walls so that Morgana can place no more than $n+1$ knights.\n\nMerlin starts by building a labyrinth of $n$ walls of his own design. He places walls in turn with increasing positive gradients, placing each so far to the right that all intersection points of previously-placed lines lie to the left of it. He paints each in such a way that blue is on the left and red is on the right.\n\nFor example, here is a possible sequence of four such lines $\\ell_{1}, \\ell_{2}, \\ell_{3}, \\ell_{4}$ :\n\n<img_3427>\n\nWe say that a region is ""on the right"" if it has $x$-coordinate unbounded above (note that if we only have one wall, then both regions are on the right). We claim inductively that, after placing $n$ lines, there are $n+1$ connected components in the resulting labyrinth, each of which contains exactly one region on the right. This is certainly true after placing 0 lines, as then there is only one region (and hence one connected component) and it is on the right.\n\nWhen placing the $n^{\\text {th }}$ line, it then cuts every one of the $n-1$ previously placed lines, and since it is to the right of all intersection points, the regions it cuts are exactly the $n$ regions on the right.\n\n<img_3985>\n\nThe addition of this line leaves all previous connected components with exactly one region on the right, and creates a new connected component containing exactly one region, and that region is also on the right. As a result, by induction, this particular labyrinth will have $n+1$ connected components.\n\nHaving built this labyrinth, Merlin then moves the walls one-by-one (by a sequence of continuous translations and rotations of lines) into the proper position of the given labyrinth, in such a way that no two lines ever become parallel.\n\n\n\nThe only time the configuration is changed is when one wall is moved through an intersection point of two others:\n<img_3360>\n\nNote that all moves really do switch between two configurations like this: all sets of three lines have this colour configuration initially, and the rules on rotations mean they are preserved (in particular, we cannot create three lines creating a triangle with three red edges inwards, or three blue edges inwards).\n\nHowever, as can be seen, such a move preserves the number of connected components, so in the painting this provides for Arthur\'s actual labyrinth, Morgana can still only place at most $n+1$ knights.']",OE_TO,,,

#Plan#:  
1. **Variable boxes**: Replace the fixed 60 boxes with an arbitrary even integer \(m \geq 2\) of boxes, requiring analysis for general \(m\).  
2. **Enhanced splitting mechanism**: Instead of a single split, Bob assigns a vector-dependent action: Bob chooses an integer weight \(w \geq 1\) in addition to \(k\), and the groups are modified asymmetrically with \(\pm w\) adjustments.  
3. **Structural generalization**: Change Bob's split to include a contiguous *subsequence* (not necessarily prefix-suffix splitting).  
4. **Win condition refinement**: Bob wins if the minimum pebble count is non-positive, universally broadening the win condition.

If there exist a positive integer $k$ such that there are at least $2 k$ boxes that have at most $k$ pebbles each then Bob can force a win.\n\nProof. We ignore the other boxes. First, Bob makes a $k$-move (splits the $2 k$ boxes into two groups of $k$ boxes each). Without loss of generality, Alice picks the left group. Then Bob makes a $(k+1)$-move, ... a $(2 k-1)$-move. By Observation A, we may suppose Alice always picks the left group.

Thus, at any time during the game, the number of pebbles in each box depends only on which choices Bob has made an odd number of times.

Let $K=\\left\\lfloor\\frac{N}{2}+1\\right\\rfloor$. For Bob's strategy, we consider a configuration $X$ with at most $M-1$ pebbles, and we make use of Observation A. Consider two configurations with $M$ pebbles: $V_{K}$ and $V_{N+1-K}$ (if $n$ is odd, they are the same configuration; if $n$ is even, one is the reverse of the other). The configuration $X$ has fewer pebbles than $V_{K}$ in at least one box, and fewer pebbles than $V_{N+1-K}$ in at least one box.\n\nSuppose first that, with respect to one of those configurations (without loss of generality $V_{K}$ ), $X$ has fewer pebbles in one of the boxes in the half where they have $1,2, \\ldots,\\left\\lceil\\frac{N}{2}\\right\\rceil$ pebbles (the right half in $V_{K}$ if $N$ is even; if $N$ is odd, we can take it to be the right half, without loss of generality, as the configuration is symmetric). Note that the number cannot be fewer in the box with 1 pebble in $V_{K}$, because then it would have 0 pebbles. Bob then does a $K$-move. If Alice picks the right group, the total number of pebbles goes down and we restart Bob's strategy with a smaller number of pebbles. If Alice picks the left group, Bob follows with a $(K+1)$-move, a $(K+2)$-move, and so on; by Observation A we may assume Alice always picks the left group. But whichever box in the right half had fewer pebbles in $X$ than in $V_{K}$ ends up with 0 pebbles at some point in this sequence of moves.\n\nOtherwise, $N$ is even, and for both of those configurations, there are fewer pebbles in $X$ only on the $2,3, \\ldots, \\frac{N}{2}+1$ side.

#Plan#:
- **Generalize the scale base**: Replace the dyadic base 2 with an arbitrary integer base \(b > 1\), so \(D(x, y)\) adapts to \(b^d \leq |x - y| < b^{d+1}\). This transforms the scale parameterization, adding a variable \(b\) that interacts with \(k\) during set construction.
- **Concretize constraints**: Instead of at most \(k\) distinct scales, require exactly \(k\) distinct scales per point to force tightness in the scale distribution, increasing proof complexity by eliminating trivial additions.
- **Add real-world structure**: Assume \(\mathcal{F}\) is a finite subset of integers within a bounded interval \([1, N]\), introducing a third parameter \(N\) that must be chosen or optimized alongside set size optimization, creating dependencies between scale resolution, set density, and interval limits.
- **Ensure coherence**: Bases \(b\) and \(N\) are now with clear criteria (e.g., \(b > 1\) integer, \(N\) upper bound); scales must satisfy integer consistency from dyadic theme; modified elements are interconnected as \(b\) affects scale graininess, \(k\) controls per-point dyadic variety, and \(N\) restricts exploration space.

#Elements Identified#:  
The core concept involves solving a Diophantine equation for positive integer triples (a, b, c) satisfying a3 + b3 + c3 = (abc)2. Key elements are:  
- **Variables**: a, b, c (positive integers).  
- **Conditions**: Equality constraint, positivity.  
- **Participants**: The triples are unordered and symmetric in the equation.  
- **Actions**: Find all solutions, which are limited and symmetric.  
- **Process**: Primarily relies on testing small values due to exponential growth.  
- **Theme**: Symmetric cubic equation with product relationship; solutions are sparse.  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
Increase complexity by modifying three components:  
- **Variables**: Impose pairwise coprimality (gcd(a,b) = gcd(b,c) = gcd(a,c) = 1) to add number-theoretic constraints and restrict possible solutions.  
- **Conditions**: Introduce an additional dependency: require c to be the sum of a and b (c = a + b), forcing interdependence, reducing symmetry, and simplifying the solution space via algebraic substitution.  
- **Process**: Explicitly necessitate consideration of ordered triples with a ? b to avoid permutations, enforcing a step for eliminating duplicates upfront.  
The modifications are interconnected: Coprimality and c = a + b imply primality considerations and growth control, while ordering streamlines case analysis. Real-world context is added through arithmetic constraints modeling combinatorial or physical dependencies (e.g., integer sums and factors). Complexity increases via refined structure.

Substituting $x=0$ and $y=f(0)$ into (1) we learn that the number $z=-f(f(0))$ satisfies $f(z)=-1$. So by plugging $y=z$ into (1) we deduce that\n\n$$\nf(x+1)=f(f(x))\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nholds for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Thereby (1) simplifies to\n\n$$\nf(x-f(y))=f(x+1)-f(y)-1 .\n\\tag{3}\n$$\n\nWe now work towards showing that $f$ is linear by contemplating the difference $f(x+1)-f(x)$ for any $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. By applying (3) with $y=x$ and (2) in this order, we obtain\n\n$$\nf(x+1)-f(x)=f(x-f(x))+1=f(f(x-1-f(x)))+1 .\n$$\n\nSince (3) shows $f(x-1-f(x))=f(x)-f(x)-1=-1$, this simplifies to\n\n$$\nf(x+1)=f(x)+A\n$$\n\nwhere $A=f(-1)+1$ is some absolute constant.\n\nNow a standard induction in both directions reveals that $f$ is indeed linear and that in fact we have $f(x)=A x+B$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where $B=f(0)$. Substituting this into (2) we obtain that\n\n$$\nA x+(A+B)=A^{2} x+(A B+B)\n$$\n\nholds for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$; applying this to $x=0$ and $x=1$ we infer $A+B=A B+B$ and $A^{2}=A$. The second equation leads to $A=0$ or $A=1$. In case $A=1$, the first equation gives $B=1$, meaning that $f$ has to be the successor function. If $A=0$, then $f$ is constant and (1) shows that its constant value has to be -1 . Thereby the solution is complete.'
 'We commence by deriving (2) and (3) as in the first solution. Now provided that $f$ is injective, (2) tells us that $f$ is the successor function. Thus we may assume from now on that $f$ is not injective, i.e., that there are two integers $a>b$ with $f(a)=f(b)$. A straightforward induction using (2) in the induction step reveals that we have $f(a+n)=f(b+n)$ for all nonnegative integers $n$. Consequently, the sequence $\\gamma_{n}=f(b+n)$ is periodic and thus in particular bounded, which means that the numbers\n\n$$\n\\varphi=\\min _{n \\geqslant 0} \\gamma_{n} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad \\psi=\\max _{n \\geqslant 0} \\gamma_{n}\n$$\n\nexist.\n\nLet us pick any integer $y$ with $f(y)=\\varphi$ and then an integer $x \\geqslant a$ with $f(x-f(y))=\\varphi$.

The same reasoning applied to $\\psi$ yields $\\psi \\leqslant-1$. Since $\\varphi \\leqslant \\psi$ holds trivially, it follows that $\\varphi=\\psi=-1$, or in other words that we have $f(t)=-1$ for all integers $t \\geqslant a$.\n\nFinally, if any integer $y$ is given, we may find an integer $x$ which is so large that $x+1 \\geqslant a$ and $x-f(y) \\geqslant a$ hold. Due to (3) and the result from the previous paragraph we get\n\n$$\nf(y)=f(x+1)-f(x-f(y))-1=(-1)-(-1)-1=-1 .\n$$\n\nThereby the problem is solved.'
 'Set $d=f(0)$. By plugging $x=f(y)$ into (1) we obtain\n\n$$\nf^{3}(y)=f(y)+d+1\n\\tag{4}\n$$\n\nfor all $y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, where the left-hand side abbreviates $f(f(f(y)))$. When we replace $x$ in (1) by $f(x)$ we obtain $f(f(x)-f(y))=f^{3}(x)-f(y)-1$ and as a consequence of (4) this simplifies to\n\n$$\nf(f(x)-f(y))=f(x)-f(y)+d\n\\tag{5}\n$$\n\nNow we consider the set\n\n$$\nE=\\{f(x)-d \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}\n\\tag{6}\n$$\n\nGiven two integers $a$ and $b$ from $E$, we may pick some integers $x$ and $y$ with $f(x)=a+d$ and $f(y)=b+d$; now (5) tells us that $f(a-b)=(a-b)+d$, which means that $a-b$ itself exemplifies $a-b \\in E$. Thus,\n\n$$\nE \\text { is closed under taking differences. }\n$$\n\nAlso, the definitions of $d$ and $E$ yield $0 \\in E$. If $E=\\{0\\}$, then $f$ is a constant function and (1) implies that the only value attained by $f$ is indeed -1 .\n\nSo let us henceforth suppose that $E$ contains some number besides zero. It is known that in this case (6) entails $E$ to be the set of all integer multiples of some positive integer $k$. Indeed, this holds for\n\n$$\nk=\\min \\{|x| \\mid x \\in E \\text { and } x \\neq 0\\}\n$$\n\nas one may verify by an argument based on division with remainder.\n\nThus we have\n\n$$\n\\{f(x) \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}=\\{k \\cdot t+d \\mid t \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}\n\\tag{7}\n$$\n\nDue to (5) and (7) we get\n\n$$\nf(k \\cdot t)=k \\cdot t+d\n$$\n\n\n\nfor all $t \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, whence in particular $f(k)=k+d$. So by comparing the results of substituting $y=0$ and $y=k$ into (1) we learn that\n\n$$\nf(z+k)=f(z)+k\n\\tag{8}\n$$\n\nholds for all integers $z$. In plain English, this means that on any residue class modulo $k$ the function $f$ is linear with slope 1 .\n\nNow by (7) the set of all values attained by $f$ is such a residue class. Hence, there exists an absolute constant $c$ such that $f(f(x))=f(x)+c$ holds for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Thereby (1) simplifies to\n\n$$\nf(x-f(y))=f(x)-f(y)+c-1 .\n\\tag{9}\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, considering (1) modulo $k$ we obtain $d \\equiv-1(\\bmod k)$ because of $(7)$. So by (7) again, $f$ attains the value -1 .\n\nThus we may apply (9) to some integer $y$ with $f(y)=-1$, which gives $f(x+1)=f(x)+c$. So $f$ is a linear function with slope $c$. Hence, (8) leads to $c=1$, wherefore there is an absolute constant $d^{\\prime}$ with $f(x)=x+d^{\\prime}$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Using this for $x=0$ we obtain $d^{\\prime}=d$ and finally (4) discloses $d=1$, meaning that $f$ is indeed the successor function.']",OE_TO,,,

#Elements Identified#:
*   **Set:** A finite set $A$ of positive integers (modifiable type/constraint).
*   **Partition:** Defined as two disjoint nonempty subsets $A_1$ and $A_2$.
*   **Good Partition Condition:** $\text{lcm}(A_1) = \gcd(A_2)$.

Step 2  
#Plan#:
1.  **Alter Set Constraint:** Replace (positive integers) with (distinct prime numbers) to impose stricter multiplicative independence and eliminate non-trivial factors in LCM/GCD calculations.
2.  **Add Arithmetic Constraint:** Require the set to be **square-free**, implicitly enforced by primality but stated for emphasis.
3.  **Introduce Subset Conditions:** Add strict conditions linking the partitions: Require elements within $A_1$ to be **pairwise coprime**, and elements within $A_2$ to be **pairwise coprime**. This creates a strong interdependence between the elements in each subset and necessitates careful selection.
4.  **Multiplicity of Target Quantities:** Change the single target (exactly 2015 good partitions) to require simultaneous satisfaction of multiple distinct target quantities (exactly 2015, 2024, and 2030 good partitions). This drastically increases combinatorial complexity and forces consideration of balanced constructions.
5.  Ensure components interconnect logically: Primality $\to$ Square-Free. Pairwise coprime conditions $\to$ Stricter LCM/GCD relationships and partition structure. Multiple targets $\to$ Highly constrained extremal set construction.

By definition, $\\operatorname{lcm} A_{1}=d=\\operatorname{gcd} A_{2}$ for some positive integer $d$. For any $a_{i} \\in A_{1}$ and $a_{j} \\in A_{2}$, we have $a_{i} \\leqslant d \\leqslant a_{j}$.

Now let $(a, b, c)$ be any triple with the desired property. If we would have $a=1$, then both $b-c$ and $c-b$ were powers of 2 , which is impossible since their sum is zero; because of symmetry, this argument shows $a, b, c \\geqslant 2$.\n\nCase 1. Among $a, b$, and $c$ there are at least two equal numbers.\n\nWithout loss of generality we may suppose that $a=b$. Then $a^{2}-c$ and $a(c-1)$ are powers of 2. The latter tells us that actually $a$ and $c-1$ are powers of 2 . So there are nonnegative integers $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$ with $a=2^{\\alpha}$ and $c=2^{\\gamma}+1$. Since $a^{2}-c=2^{2 \\alpha}-2^{\\gamma}-1$ is a power of 2 and thus incongruent to -1 modulo 4 , we must have $\\gamma \\leqslant 1$. Moreover, each of the terms $2^{2 \\alpha}-2$ and $2^{2 \\alpha}-3$ can only be a power of 2 if $\\alpha=1$. It follows that the triple $(a, b, c)$ is either $(2,2,2)$ or $(2,2,3)$.\n\nCase 2. The numbers $a, b$, and $c$ are distinct.\n\nDue to symmetry we may suppose that\n\n$$\n2 \\leqslant a<b<c .\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nWe are to prove that the triple $(a, b, c)$ is either $(2,6,11)$ or $(3,5,7)$.

Assume for the sake of contradiction that $\\gamma>0$. Then $c$ is even by (4) and, similarly, $b$ is even by (5) and (3). So the left-hand side of (2) is congruent to 2 modulo 4 , which is only possible if $b c=4$. As this contradicts (1), we have thereby shown that $\\gamma=0$, i.e., that $c=2 b-1$.\n\nNow (3) yields $3 b-2=2^{\\beta}$. Due to $b>2$ this is only possible if $\\beta \\geqslant 4$. If $\\beta=4$, then we get $b=6$ and $c=2 \\cdot 6-1=11$, which is a solution. It remains to deal with the case $\\beta \\geqslant 5$.

On the other hand, $2^{\\beta}=a c-b>$ $(a-1) c \\geqslant 2 c$ implies in view of (1) that $a$ and $b$ are smaller than $2^{\\beta-1}$. All this is only possible if $\\vartheta=1$ and $a+b=2^{\\beta-1}$. Now (3) yields\n\n$$\na c-b=2(a+b),\n\\tag{6}\n$$\n\nwhence $4 b>a+3 b=a(c-1) \\geqslant a b$, which in turn yields $a=3$.\n\nSo (6) simplifies to $c=b+2$ and (2) tells us that $b(b+2)-3=(b-1)(b+3)$ is a power of 2. Consequently, the factors $b-1$ and $b+3$ are powers of 2 themselves. Since their difference is 4 , this is only possible if $b=5$ and thus $c=7$. Thereby the solution is complete.'
 'As in the beginning of the first solution, we observe that $a, b, c \\geqslant 2$. Depending on the parities of $a, b$, and $c$ we distinguish three cases.\n\nCase 1. The numbers $a, b$, and $c$ are even.\n\nLet $2^{A}, 2^{B}$, and $2^{C}$ be the largest powers of 2 dividing $a, b$, and $c$ respectively. We may assume without loss of generality that $1 \\leqslant A \\leqslant B \\leqslant C$. Now $2^{B}$ is the highest power of 2 dividing $a c-b$, whence $a c-b=2^{B} \\leqslant b$. Similarly, we deduce $b c-a=2^{A} \\leqslant a$. Adding both estimates we get $(a+b) c \\leqslant 2(a+b)$, whence $c \\leqslant 2$. So $c=2$ and thus $A=B=C=1$; moreover, we must have had equality throughout, i.e., $a=2^{A}=2$ and $b=2^{B}=2$. We have thereby found the solution $(a, b, c)=(2,2,2)$.\n\nCase 2. The numbers $a, b$, and $c$ are odd.\n\nIf any two of these numbers are equal, say $a=b$, then $a c-b=a(c-1)$ has a nontrivial odd divisor and cannot be a power of 2 . Hence $a, b$, and $c$ are distinct. So we may assume without loss of generality that $a<b<c$.\n\nLet $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ denote the nonnegative integers for which $b c-a=2^{\\alpha}$ and $a c-b=2^{\\beta}$ hold. Clearly, we have $\\alpha>\\beta$, and thus $2^{\\beta}$ divides\n\n$$\na \\cdot 2^{\\alpha}-b \\cdot 2^{\\beta}=a(b c-a)-b(a c-b)=b^{2}-a^{2}=(b+a)(b-a) .\n$$\n\nSince $a$ is odd, it is not possible that both factors $b+a$ and $b-a$ are divisible by 4 . Consequently, one of them has to be a multiple of $2^{\\beta-1}$. Hence one of the numbers $2(b+a)$ and $2(b-a)$ is divisible by $2^{\\beta}$ and in either case we have\n\n$$\na c-b=2^{\\beta} \\leqslant 2(a+b) .\n\\tag{7}\n$$\n\nThis in turn yields $(a-1) b<a c-b<4 b$ and thus $a=3$ (recall that $a$ is odd and larger than 1). Substituting this back into (7) we learn $c \\leqslant b+2$. But due to the parity $b<c$ entails that $b+2 \\leqslant c$ holds as well. So we get $c=b+2$ and from $b c-a=(b-1)(b+3)$ being a power of 2 it follows that $b=5$ and $c=7$.\n\nCase 3. Among $a, b$, and $c$ both parities occur.\n\nWithout loss of generality, we suppose that $c$ is odd and that $a \\leqslant b$. We are to show that $(a, b, c)$ is either $(2,2,3)$ or $(2,6,11)$. As at least one of $a$ and $b$ is even, the expression $a b-c$ is odd; since it is also a power of 2 , we obtain\n\n$$\na b-c=1 \\text {. }\n\\tag{8}\n$$\n\nIf $a=b$, then $c=a^{2}-1$, and from $a c-b=a\\left(a^{2}-2\\right)$ being a power of 2 it follows that both $a$ and $a^{2}-2$ are powers of 2 , whence $a=2$. This gives rise to the solution $(2,2,3)$.\n\n\n\nWe may suppose $a<b$ from now on.

Now $a b-2$ is even but not divisible by 4 , so the highest power of 2 dividing $a+b$ is $2^{\\beta-1}$. For this reason, the equations (10) and (11) show that the highest powers of 2 dividing either of the numbers $a b^{2}$ and $a^{2} b$ is likewise $2^{\\beta-1}$. Thus there is an integer $\\tau \\geqslant 1$ together with odd integers $A, B$, and $C$ such that $a=2^{\\tau} A, b=2^{\\tau} B, a+b=2^{3 \\tau} C$, and $\\beta=1+3 \\tau$.\n\nNotice that $A+B=2^{2 \\tau} C \\geqslant 4 C$.

Finally, one may conclude $C=1, \\tau=1, a=2, b=6$, and $c=11$. We have thereby found the triple $(2,6,11)$. This completes the discussion of the third case, and hence the solution.

#Elements Identified#:
1. **Domain and codomain of f:** Both are $\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ (positive integers).
2. **Core Condition:** $\operatorname{gcd}(f(m)+n, f(n)+m) \leqslant k$ for all distinct pairs $(m, n)$.
3. **Bound $k$:** A fixed positive integer bounding the gcd.
4. **Function Property:** Defined as $k$-good based on the condition holding for all distinct pairs.
5. **Objective:** Find all $k$ for which *any* $k$-good function exists.

7. **Theme:** Number theory (gcd), functional inequalities/existence.

#Plan#:
1. **Increase Variables/Relations:** Extend the core condition from pairs to *triplets* of distinct positive integers ($p, q, r$), maintaining the gcd structure. This inherently adds combinatorial complexity.
2. **Tighten the Core Condition:** Change the inequality $\operatorname{gcd}(...) \leqslant k$ to a strict *equality* $\operatorname{gcd}(...) = \kappa$, where $\kappa$ depends on $k$. This forces the gcd to be precisely controlled rather than just bounded.
3. **Concretize/Add Constraint on $f$:** Introduce an additional mandatory *numerical constraint* on the function values themselves, independent of the gcd condition but interacting with it. Use a ratio condition $f(p)/f(q) \geq p/q$ to prevent simple linear functions and add nonlinearity.
4. **Link Added Elements:** Bind the new equality constant $\kappa$ to the original parameter $k$ as $\kappa = s(k)$, where $s(k)$ is a *specified arithmetic function* of $k$ (here, $k^2 + k + 1$), adding a layer of dependency.

Note that a $k$-good function is also $(k+1)$-good for any positive integer $k$. Hence, it suffices to show that there does not exist a 1-good function and that there exists a 2-good function.\n\nWe first show that there is no 1-good function. Suppose that there exists a function $f$ such that $G_{f}(m, n)=1$ for all $m \\neq n$. Now, if there are two distinct even numbers $m$ and $n$ such that $f(m)$ and $f(n)$ are both even, then $2 \\mid G_{f}(m, n)$, a contradiction. A similar argument holds if there are two distinct odd numbers $m$ and $n$ such that $f(m)$ and $f(n)$ are both odd. Hence we can choose an even $m$ and an odd $n$ such that $f(m)$ is odd and $f(n)$ is even. This also implies that $2 \\mid G_{f}(m, n)$, a contradiction.\n\nWe now construct a 2 -good function. Define $f(n)=2^{g(n)+1}-n-1$, where $g$ is defined recursively by $g(1)=1$ and $g(n+1)=\\left(2^{g(n)+1}\\right) !$.\n\nFor any positive integers $m>n$, set\n\n$$\nA=f(m)+n=2^{g(m)+1}-m+n-1, \\quad B=f(n)+m=2^{g(n)+1}-n+m-1 .\n$$\n\nWe need to show that $\\operatorname{gcd}(A, B) \\leqslant 2$. First, note that $A+B=2^{g(m)+1}+2^{g(n)+1}-2$ is not divisible by 4 , so that $4 \\nmid \\operatorname{gcd}(A, B)$. Now we suppose that there is an odd prime $p$ for which $p \\mid \\operatorname{gcd}(A, B)$ and derive a contradiction.\n\nWe first claim that $2^{g(m-1)+1} \\geqslant B$. This is a rather weak bound; one way to prove it is as follows. Observe that $g(k+1)>g(k)$ and hence $2^{g(k+1)+1} \\geqslant 2^{g(k)+1}+1$ for every positive integer $k$. By repeatedly applying this inequality, we obtain $2^{g(m-1)+1} \\geqslant 2^{g(n)+1}+(m-1)-n=B$.\n\nNow, since $p \\mid B$, we have $p-1<B \\leqslant 2^{g(m-1)+1}$, so that $p-1 \\mid\\left(2^{g(m-1)+1}\\right) !=g(m)$. Hence $2^{g(m)} \\equiv 1(\\bmod p)$, which yields $A+B \\equiv 2^{g(n)+1}(\\bmod p)$. However, since $p \\mid A+B$, this implies that $p=2$, a contradiction.'
 'We provide an alternative construction of a 2-good function $f$.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{P}$ be the set consisting of 4 and all odd primes.

After the $m^{\\text {th }}$ step, the construction will satisfy the following conditions:\n\n(i) The values of $f(n)$ have already been defined for all $n \\leqslant m$, and $p$-useful numbers $a_{p}$ have already been defined for all $p \\leqslant m+2$;\n\n(ii) If $n \\leqslant m$ and $p \\leqslant m+2$, then $f(n)+n \\not \\equiv a_{p}(\\bmod p)$;\n\n(iii) $\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(f\\left(n_{1}\\right)+n_{2}, f\\left(n_{2}\\right)+n_{1}\\right) \\leqslant 2$ for all $n_{1}<n_{2} \\leqslant m$.\n\nIf these conditions are satisfied, then $f$ will be a 2-good function.\n\nStep 1.

Now let $p=m+2$ and suppose that $p \\in \\mathcal{P}$. We choose $a_{p}$ to be a residue modulo $p$ that is not congruent to 0,2 , or $f(n)+n$ for any $n \\leqslant m$. Since $f(1)+1=2$, there are at most $m+1<p$ residues to avoid, so we can always choose a remaining residue.\n\nWe first check that ( $i$ ii) is satisfied. We only need to check it if $p=m+2$ or $n=m$. In the former case, we have $f(n)+n \\not \\equiv a_{p}(\\bmod p)$ by construction. In the latter case, if $n=m$ and $p \\leqslant m+1$, then we have $f(m)+m \\equiv-a_{p} \\not \\equiv a_{p}(\\bmod p)$, where we make use of the fact that $a_{p}$ is $p$-useful.\n\nNow we check that (iii) holds.

#Elements Identified#:  
- **Variables**: Polynomial \(P(x)\) with real coefficients, real numbers \(x\), \(y\).  
- **Conditions**: The biconditional equivalence \(\left|y^{2}-P(x)\right| \leqslant 2|x|\) if and only if \(\left|x^{2}-P(y)\right| \leqslant 2|y|\) must hold for all real \(x\), \(y\).

- **Theme**: Symmetry between the polynomial evaluation in \(x\) and \(y\) with quadratic terms and absolute values.  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
- **Modify variables**: Introduce a new real variable \(z\) to extend pairwise conditions to a cyclic triplet.  
- **Expand conditions**: Require the original equivalence for all pairs \((x,y)\), \((y,z)\), and \((z,x)\), but make these pairwise conditions interdependent by needing that all three are simultaneously true or simultaneously false for a given \((x,y,z)\).  
- **Add constraints**: Restrict the polynomials to those with real coefficients and even degree to limit the solution space by growth constraints.  
- **Concretize**: Ensure logical coherence and solvability by maintaining the polynomial constraints and mutual dependence within the triplet.  
- **Increase complexity**: Add real-world analogy by implying cyclic consistency (as in symmetric systems) and embed multiple variables with pairwise-dependent interactions.

To see that each negative real number $-C$ can be $P(0)$, it suffices to check that for every $C>0$ the polynomial $P(x)=-\\left(\\frac{2 x^{2}}{C}+C\\right)$ has the property described in the statement of the problem. Due to symmetry it is enough for this purpose to prove $\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right|>2|x|$ for any two real numbers $x$ and $y$. In fact we have\n\n$$\n\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right|=y^{2}+\\frac{x^{2}}{C}+\\frac{(|x|-C)^{2}}{C}+2|x| \\geqslant \\frac{x^{2}}{C}+2|x| \\geqslant 2|x|\n$$\n\nwhere in the first estimate equality can only hold if $|x|=C$, whilst in the second one it can only hold if $x=0$. As these two conditions cannot be met at the same time, we have indeed $\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right|>2|x|$.\n\nTo show that $P(0)=1$ is possible as well, we verify that the polynomial $P(x)=x^{2}+1$ satisfies (1). Notice that for all real numbers $x$ and $y$ we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x| & \\Longleftrightarrow\\left(y^{2}-x^{2}-1\\right)^{2} \\leqslant 4 x^{2} \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow 0 \\leqslant\\left(\\left(y^{2}-(x-1)^{2}\\right)\\left((x+1)^{2}-y^{2}\\right)\\right. \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow 0 \\leqslant(y-x+1)(y+x-1)(x+1-y)(x+1+y) \\\\\n& \\Longleftrightarrow 0 \\leqslant\\left((x+y)^{2}-1\\right)\\left(1-(x-y)^{2}\\right) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSince this inequality is symmetric in $x$ and $y$, we are done.\n\nPart II. Now we show that no values other than those mentioned in the answer are possible for $P(0)$. To reach this we let $P$ denote any polynomial satisfying (1) and $P(0) \\geqslant 0$; as we shall see, this implies $P(x)=x^{2}+1$ for all real $x$, which is actually more than what we want.\n\nFirst step: We prove that $P$ is even.\n\nBy (1) we have\n\n$$\n\\left|y^{2}-P(x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x| \\Longleftrightarrow\\left|x^{2}-P(y)\\right| \\leqslant 2|y| \\Longleftrightarrow\\left|y^{2}-P(-x)\\right| \\leqslant 2|x|\n$$\n\nfor all real numbers $x$ and $y$. Considering just the equivalence of the first and third statement and taking into account that $y^{2}$ may vary through $\\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}$ we infer that\n\n$$\n[P(x)-2|x|, P(x)+2|x|] \\cap \\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}=[P(-x)-2|x|, P(-x)+2|x|] \\cap \\mathbb{R}_{\\geqslant 0}\n$$\n\nholds for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We claim that there are infinitely many real numbers $x$ such that $P(x)+2|x| \\geqslant 0$. This holds in fact for any real polynomial with $P(0) \\geqslant 0$; in order to see this, we may assume that the coefficient of $P$ appearing in front of $x$ is nonnegative. In this case the desired inequality holds for all sufficiently small positive real numbers.\n\nFor such numbers $x$ satisfying $P(x)+2|x| \\geqslant 0$ we have $P(x)+2|x|=P(-x)+2|x|$ by the previous displayed formula, and hence also $P(x)=P(-x)$. Consequently the polynomial $P(x)-P(-x)$ has infinitely many zeros, wherefore it has to vanish identically. Thus $P$ is indeed even.\n\n\n\nSecond step: We prove that $P(t)>0$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nLet us assume for a moment that there exists a real number $t \\neq 0$ with $P(t)=0$. Then there is some open interval $I$ around $t$ such that $|P(y)| \\leqslant 2|y|$ holds for all $y \\in I$. Plugging $x=0$ into (1) we learn that $y^{2}=P(0)$ holds for all $y \\in I$, which is clearly absurd. We have thus shown $P(t) \\neq 0$ for all $t \\neq 0$.\n\nIn combination with $P(0) \\geqslant 0$ this informs us that our claim could only fail if $P(0)=0$. In this case there is by our first step a polynomial $Q(x)$ such that $P(x)=x^{2} Q(x)$. Applying (1) to $x=0$ and an arbitrary $y \\neq 0$ we get $|y Q(y)|>2$, which is surely false when $y$ is sufficiently small.\n\nThird step: We prove that $P$ is a quadratic polynomial.\n\nNotice that $P$ cannot be constant, for otherwise if $x=\\sqrt{P(0)}$ and $y$ is sufficiently large, the first part of (1) is false whilst the second part is true. So the degree $n$ of $P$ has to be at least 1 . By our first step $n$ has to be even as well, whence in particular $n \\geqslant 2$.\n\nNow assume that $n \\geqslant 4$. Plugging $y=\\sqrt{P(x)}$ into (1) we get $\\left|x^{2}-P(\\sqrt{P(x)})\\right| \\leqslant 2 \\sqrt{P(x)}$ and hence\n\n$$\nP(\\sqrt{P(x)}) \\leqslant x^{2}+2 \\sqrt{P(x)}\n$$\n\nfor all real $x$. Choose positive real numbers $x_{0}, a$, and $b$ such that if $x \\in\\left(x_{0}, \\infty\\right)$, then $a x^{n}<$ $P(x)<b x^{n}$; this is indeed possible, for if $d>0$ denotes the leading coefficient of $P$, then $\\lim _{x \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{P(x)}{x^{n}}=d$, whence for instance the numbers $a=\\frac{d}{2}$ and $b=2 d$ work provided that $x_{0}$ is chosen large enough.\n\nNow for all sufficiently large real numbers $x$ we have\n\n$$\na^{n / 2+1} x^{n^{2} / 2}<a P(x)^{n / 2}<P(\\sqrt{P(x)}) \\leqslant x^{2}+2 \\sqrt{P(x)}<x^{n / 2}+2 b^{1 / 2} x^{n / 2},\n$$\n\ni.e.\n\n$$\nx^{\\left(n^{2}-n\\right) / 2}<\\frac{1+2 b^{1 / 2}}{a^{n / 2+1}}\n$$\n\nwhich is surely absurd. Thus $P$ is indeed a quadratic polynomial.\n\nFourth step: We prove that $P(x)=x^{2}+1$.\n\nIn the light of our first three steps there are two real numbers $a>0$ and $b$ such that $P(x)=$ $a x^{2}+b$. Now if $x$ is large enough and $y=\\sqrt{a} x$, the left part of (1) holds and the right part reads $\\left|\\left(1-a^{2}\\right) x^{2}-b\\right| \\leqslant 2 \\sqrt{a} x$. In view of the fact that $a>0$ this is only possible if $a=1$. Finally, substituting $y=x+1$ with $x>0$ into (1) we get\n\n$$\n|2 x+1-b| \\leqslant 2 x \\Longleftrightarrow|2 x+1+b| \\leqslant 2 x+2,\n$$\n\ni.e.,\n\n$$\nb \\in[1,4 x+1] \\Longleftrightarrow b \\in[-4 x-3,1]\n$$\n\nfor all $x>0$. Choosing $x$ large enough, we can achieve that at least one of these two statements holds; then both hold, which is only possible if $b=1$, as desired.']",OE_TO,,,

- **Modify happy configuration condition:** Require rooks to be placed only on non-obstacle squares, and add an existence condition (per row/column free square) to ensure the problem is well-defined, linking obstacles to configurability.
- **Add global constraint for obstacles:** Generalize the empty subgrid requirement: the $k \times k$ square must be entirely free of obstacles and rooks, introducing a secondary layer of avoidance.

1. The winner only depends on the relative order of the 200 cards: if the cards are laid down in increasing order face down and we are told which card belongs to which player, but not what numbers are written on them, we can still decide the winner.

At least one of the two relations\n\n$$\n(\\{2\\} \\cup\\{2 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\})<(\\{1\\} \\cup\\{2 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\})\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n(\\{2 i-1 \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n\\})<(\\{2 i \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n-1\\})\n$$\n\nholds.\n\nProof. Suppose that the first relation does not hold. Since our rule may only depend on the relative order, we must also have\n\n$$\n(\\{2\\} \\cup\\{3 i-2 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n-2\\})>(\\{1\\} \\cup\\{3 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n\\}) .\n$$\n\nLikewise, if the second relation does not hold, then we must also have\n\n$$\n(\\{1\\} \\cup\\{3 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n\\})>(\\{3\\} \\cup\\{3 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n-1\\}) .\n$$\n\nNow condition 3 implies that\n\n$$\n(\\{2\\} \\cup\\{3 i-2 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n-2\\})>(\\{3\\} \\cup\\{3 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{3 n-1\\}),\n$$\n\nwhich contradicts the second condition.\n\nNow we distinguish two cases, depending on which of the two relations actually holds:\n\nFirst case: $(\\{2\\} \\cup\\{2 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\})<(\\{1\\} \\cup\\{2 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\})$.\n\nLet $A=\\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right\\}$ and $B=\\left\\{b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$ be two disjoint sets, both in increasing order. We claim that the winner can be decided only from the values of $a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ and $b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}$, while $a_{1}$ and $b_{1}$ are actually irrelevant. Suppose that this was not the case, and assume without loss of generality that $a_{2}<b_{2}$. Then the relative order of $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}$ is fixed, and the position of $b_{1}$ has to decide the winner. Suppose that for some value $b_{1}=x, B$ wins, while for some other value $b_{1}=y, A$ wins.\n\nWrite $B_{x}=\\left\\{x, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$ and $B_{y}=\\left\\{y, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right\\}$, and let $\\varepsilon>0$ be smaller than half the distance between any two of the numbers in $B_{x} \\cup B_{y} \\cup A$. For any set $M$, let $M \\pm \\varepsilon$ be the set obtained by adding/subtracting $\\varepsilon$ to all elements of $M$. By our choice of $\\varepsilon$, the relative order of the elements of $\\left(B_{y}+\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup A$ is still the same as for $B_{y} \\cup A$, while the relative order of the elements of $\\left(B_{x}-\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup A$ is still the same as for $B_{x} \\cup A$. Thus $A<B_{x}-\\varepsilon$, but $A>B_{y}+\\varepsilon$. Moreover, if $y>x$, then $B_{x}-\\varepsilon \\prec B_{y}+\\varepsilon$ by condition 2, while otherwise the relative order of\n\n\n\nthe elements in $\\left(B_{x}-\\varepsilon\\right) \\cup\\left(B_{y}+\\varepsilon\\right)$ is the same as for the two sets $\\{2\\} \\cup\\{2 i-1 \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\}$ and $\\{1\\} \\cup\\{2 i \\mid 2 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n\\}$, so that $B_{x}-\\varepsilon<B_{y}+\\varepsilon$. In either case, we obtain\n\n$$\nA \\prec B_{x}-\\varepsilon \\prec B_{y}+\\varepsilon<A,\n$$\n\nwhich contradicts condition 3 .\n\nSo we know now that the winner does not depend on $a_{1}, b_{1}$. Therefore, we can define a new rule $<^{*}$ on sets of cardinality $n-1$ by saying that $A \\prec^{*} B$ if and only if $A \\cup\\{a\\} \\prec B \\cup\\{b\\}$ for some $a, b$ (or equivalently, all $a, b$ ) such that $a<\\min A, b<\\min B$ and $A \\cup\\{a\\}$ and $B \\cup\\{b\\}$ are disjoint. The rule $<^{*}$ satisfies all conditions again, so by the induction hypothesis, there exists an index $i$ such that $A \\prec^{*} B$ if and only if the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $A$ is less than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $B$. This implies that $C<D$ if and only if the $(i+1)^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $C$ is less than the $(i+1)^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $D$, which completes our induction.\n\nSecond case: $(\\{2 i-1 \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n\\})<(\\{2 i \\mid 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n-1\\} \\cup\\{2 n-1\\})$. Set $-A=\\{-a \\mid a \\in A\\}$ for any $A \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$. For any two disjoint sets $A, B \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ of cardinality $n$, we write $A \\prec^{\\circ} B$ to mean $(-B) \\prec(-A)$. It is easy to see that $\\prec^{\\circ}$ defines a rule to determine a winner that satisfies the three conditions of our problem as well as the relation of the first case. So it follows in the same way as in the first case that for some $i, A \\prec^{\\circ} B$ if and only if the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $A$ is less than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ smallest element of $B$, which is equivalent to the condition that the $i^{\\text {th }}$ largest element of $-A$ is greater than the $i^{\\text {th }}$ largest element of $-B$. This proves that the original rule $<$ also has the desired form.']",OE_TO,,,

1.  **Manipulate Set Definition (Exponent Range):** Modify the exponent range defining the set to depend on $n$ in a non-trivial way, moving beyond the simple $[0, n)$. This introduces complexity based on $n$'s properties.
2.  **Add a Constraint to Representations:** Introduce a representation requirement beyond simple summation, such as satisfying a specified congruence condition modulo a function of $n$. This adds a modular arithmetic layer.
3.  **Introduce Multiplicity Constraints:** Restrict the count of times elements can appear in the sum using a variable bound (a linear function of $n$), increasing complexity without adding uncontrolled variables.
4.  **Ensure Coherence:** The modulus and multiplicity bound are chosen as functions of $n$ (specifically $2^n$ and $\lfloor n/2 \rfloor$) to maintain intrinsic connection to the set's structure and theme. All modified elements interact to make the representability problem distinctly harder.

4.  **Ensure Interconnection:** The minimization condition uses the key expression `x f(z) + z f(x)`. The involutive property `f(f(y)) = y` strongly interacts with the minimization result. The parameter `K` appears as the value attained by the minimum. All elements are logically bound.

We say that a pair of positive real numbers $(x, y)$ is $\\operatorname{good}$ if $x f(y)+y f(x) \\leqslant 2$. Observe that if $(x, y)$ is good, then so is $(y, x)$.\n\nLemma 1.0. If $(x, y)$ is good, then $x=y$.\n\nProof. Assume that there exist positive real numbers $x \\neq y$ such that $(x, y)$ is good. The uniqueness assumption says that $y$ is the unique positive real number such that $(x, y)$ is good. In particular, $(x, x)$ is not a good pair. This means that\n\n$$\nx f(x)+x f(x)>2\n$$\n\nand thus $x f(x)>1$. Similarly, $(y, x)$ is a good pair, so $(y, y)$ is not a good pair, which implies $y f(y)>1$. We apply the AM-GM inequality to obtain\n\n$$\nx f(y)+y f(x) \\geqslant 2 \\sqrt{x f(y) \\cdot y f(x)}=2 \\sqrt{x f(x) \\cdot y f(y)}>2\n$$\n\nThis is a contradiction, since $(x, y)$ is a good pair.\n\nBy assumption, for any $x>0$, there always exists a good pair containing $x$, however Lemma 1 implies that the only good pair that can contain $x$ is $(x, x)$, so\n\n$$\nx f(x) \\leqslant 1 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad f(x) \\leqslant \\frac{1}{x},\n$$\n\nfor every $x>0$.\n\nIn particular, with $x=1 / f(t)$ for $t>0$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{f(t)} \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{1}{f(t)}\\right) \\leqslant 1\n$$\n\nHence\n\n$$\nt \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{1}{f(t)}\\right) \\leqslant t f(t) \\leqslant 1\n$$\n\nWe claim that $(t, 1 / f(t))$ is a good pair for every $t>0$.

We give an alternative way to prove that $f(x)=1 / x$ assuming $f(x) \\leqslant 1 / x$ for every $x>0$.\n\nIndeed, if $f(x)<1 / x$ then for every $a>0$ with $f(x)<1 / a<1 / x$ (and there are at least two of them), we have\n\n$$\na f(x)+x f(a)<1+\\frac{x}{a}<2 .\n$$\n\nHence $(x, a)$ is a good pair for every such $a$, a contradiction. We conclude that $f(x)=1 / x$.\n\n\n2. We can also conclude from Lemma 1 and $f(x) \\leqslant 1 / x$ as follows.\n\nLemma 2. The function $f$ is decreasing.\n\nProof. Let $y>x>0$. Lemma 1 says that $(x, y)$ is not a good pair, but $(y, y)$ is. Hence\n\n$$\nx f(y)+y f(x)>2 \\geqslant 2 y f(y)>y f(y)+x f(y),\n$$\n\nwhere we used $y>x$ (and $f(y)>0$ ) in the last inequality. This implies that $f(x)>f(y)$, showing that $f$ is decreasing.\n\nWe now prove that $f(x)=1 / x$ for all $x$. Fix a value of $x$ and note that for $y>x$ we must have $x f(x)+y f(x)>x f(y)+y f(x)>2$ (using that $f$ is decreasing for the first step), hence $f(x)>\\frac{2}{x+y}$. The last inequality is true for every $y>x>0$. If we fix $x$ and look for the supremum of the expression $\\frac{2}{x+y}$ over all $y>x$, we get\n\n$$\nf(x) \\geqslant \\frac{2}{x+x}=\\frac{1}{x}\n$$\n\nSince we already know that $f(x) \\leqslant 1 / x$, we conclude that $f(x)=1 / x$.'
 'As in the first solution, we note that $f(x)=1 / x$ is a solution, and we set out to prove that it is the only one. We write $g(x)$ for the unique positive real number such that $(x, g(x))$ is a good pair. In this solution, we prove Lemma 2 without assuming Lemma 1.\n\nLemma 2. The function $f$ is decreasing.\n\nProof. Consider $x<y$. It holds that $y f(g(y))+g(y) f(y) \\leqslant 2$. Moreover, because $y$ is the only positive real number such that $(g(y), y)$ is a good pair and $x \\neq y$, we have $x f(g(y))+g(y) f(x)>$ 2. Combining these two inequalities yields\n\n$$\nx f(g(y))+g(y) f(x)>2 \\geqslant y f(g(y))+g(y) f(y)\n$$\n\nor $f(g(y))(x-y)>g(y)(f(y)-f(x))$. Because $g(y)$ and $f(g(y))$ are both positive while $x-y$ is negative, it follows that $f(y)<f(x)$, showing that $f$ is decreasing.\n\nWe now prove Lemma 1 using Lemma 2. Suppose that $x \\neq y$ but $x f(y)+y f(x) \\leqslant 2$. As in the first solution, we get $x f(x)+x f(x)>2$ and $y f(y)+y f(y)>2$, which implies $x f(x)+y f(y)>2$. Now\n\n$$\nx f(x)+y f(y)>2 \\geqslant x f(y)+y f(x)\n$$\n\nimplies $(x-y)(f(x)-f(y))>0$, which contradicts the fact that $f$ is decreasing. So $y=x$ is the unique $y$ such that $(x, y)$ is a good pair, and in particular we have $f(x) \\leqslant 1 / x$.\n\nWe can now conclude the proof'
 'As in the other solutions we verify that the function $f(x)=1 / x$ is a solution. We first want to prove the following lemma:\n\nLemma 3. For all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ we actually have $x f(g(x))+g(x) f(x)=2$ (that is: the inequality is actually an equality).\n\n\n\nProof. We proceed by contradiction: Assume there exists some number $x>0$ such that for $y=g(x)$ we have $x f(y)+y f(x)<2$. Then for any $0<\\epsilon<\\frac{2-x f(y)-y f(x)}{2 f(x)}$ we have, by uniqueness of $y$, that $x f(y+\\epsilon)+(y+\\epsilon) f(x)>2$. Therefore\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(y+\\epsilon) & >\\frac{2-(y+\\epsilon) f(x)}{x}=\\frac{2-y f(x)-\\epsilon f(x)}{x} \\\\\n& >\\frac{2-y f(x)-\\frac{2-x f(y)-y f(x)}{2}}{x} \\\\\n& =\\frac{2-x f(y)-y f(x)}{2 x}+f(y)>f(y) .\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nFurthermore, for every such $\\epsilon$ we have $g(y+\\epsilon) f(y+\\epsilon)+(y+\\epsilon) f(g(y+\\epsilon)) \\leqslant 2$ and $g(y+\\epsilon) f(y)+y f(g(y+\\epsilon))>2($ since $y \\neq y+\\epsilon=g(g(y+\\epsilon)))$. This gives us the two inequalities\n\n$$\nf(g(y+\\epsilon)) \\leqslant \\frac{2-g(y+\\epsilon) f(y+\\epsilon)}{y+\\epsilon} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad f(g(y+\\epsilon))>\\frac{2-g(y+\\epsilon) f(y)}{y} \\text {. }\n$$\n\nCombining these two inequalities and rearranging the terms leads to the inequality\n\n$$\n2 \\epsilon<g(y+\\epsilon)[(y+\\epsilon) f(y)-y f(y+\\epsilon)] \\text {. }\n$$\n\nMoreover combining with the inequality (1) we obtain\n\n$$\n2 \\epsilon<g(y+\\epsilon)\\left[(y+\\epsilon) f(y)-y\\left(\\frac{2-x f(y)-y f(x)}{2 x}+f(y)\\right)\\right]=g(y+\\epsilon)\\left[\\epsilon f(y)-y \\frac{2-x f(y)-y f(x)}{2 x}\\right]\n$$\n\nWe now reach the desired contradiction, since for $\\epsilon$ sufficiently small we have that the left hand side is positive while the right hand side is negative.\n\nWith this lemma it then follows that for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ we have\n\n$$\nx f(y)+y f(x) \\geqslant 2\n$$\n\nsince for $y=g(x)$ we have equality and by uniqueness for $y \\neq g(x)$ the inequality is strict.\n\nIn particular for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$ and for $y=x$ we have $2 x f(x) \\geqslant 2$, or equivalently $f(x) \\geqslant 1 / x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$. With this inequality we obtain for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$\n\n$$\n2 \\geqslant x f(g(x))+g(x) f(x) \\geqslant \\frac{x}{g(x)}+\\frac{g(x)}{x} \\geqslant 2\n$$\n\nwhere the first inequality comes from the problem statement. Consequently each of these inequalities must actually be an equality, and in particular we obtain $f(x)=1 / x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$.'
 'Again, let us prove that $f(x)=1 / x$ is the only solution. Let again $g(x)$ be the unique positive real number such that $(x, g(x))$ is a good pair.\n\nLemma 4. The function $f$ is strictly convex.\n\nProof. Consider the function $q_{s}(x)=f(x)+s x$ for some real number $s$. If $f$ is not strictly convex, then there exist $u<v$ and $t \\in(0,1)$ such that\n\n$$\nf(t u+(1-t) v) \\geqslant t f(u)+(1-t) f(v) .\n$$\n\nHence\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nq_{s}(t u+(1-t) v) & \\geqslant t f(u)+(1-t) f(v)+s(t u+(1-t) v) \\\\\n& =t q_{s}(u)+(1-t) q_{s}(v)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\n\nLet $w=t u+(1-t) v$ and consider the case $s=f(g(w)) / g(w)$. For that particular choice of $s$, the function $q_{s}(x)$ has a unique minimum at $x=w$. However, since $q_{s}(w) \\geqslant t q_{s}(u)+(1-t) q_{s}(v)$, it must hold $q_{s}(u) \\leqslant q_{s}(w)$ or $q_{s}(v) \\leqslant q_{s}(w)$, a contradiction.\n\nLemma 5. The function $f$ is continuous.\n\nProof. Since $f$ is strictly convex and defined on an open interval, it is also continuous.\n\nwe can now prove that $f(x) \\leqslant 1 / x$. If $f(x)<1 / x$, then we consider the function $h(y)=x f(y)+y f(x)$ which is continuous. Since $h(x)<2$, there exist at least two distinct $z \\neq x$ such that $h(z)<2$ giving that $(x, z)$ is good pair for both values of $z$, a contradiction.

The lumberjack may therefore cut those trees, ensuring no tree on a non-coloured square has positive height after his turn. Hence there cannot ever be more majestic trees than coloured squares, which is $5 N^{2}$.\n\nNext, we prove the gardener may ensure there are $5 N^{2}$ majestic trees. In fact, we prove this statement in a modified game which is more difficult for the gardener: on the lumberjack's turn in the modified game, he may decrement the height of all trees on the board except those the gardener did not just grow, in addition to four of the trees the gardener just grew. Clearly, a sequence of moves for the gardener which ensures that there are $K$ majestic trees in the modified game also ensures this in the original game.\n\n\n\nLet $M=\\left(\\begin{array}{l}9 \\\\ 5\\end{array}\\right)$; we say that a $m a p$ is one of the $M$ possible ways to mark 5 squares on a $3 \\times 3$ board. In the modified game, after the gardener chooses a $3 \\times 3$ subboard on the board, the lumberjack chooses a map in this subboard, and the total result of the two moves is that each tree marked on the map increases its height by 1, each tree in the subboard which is not in the map remains unchanged, and each tree outside the subboard decreases its height by 1 . Also note that if the gardener chooses a $3 \\times 3$ subboard $M l$ times, the lumberjack will have to choose some map at least $l$ times, so there will be at least 5 trees which each have height $\\geqslant l$.\n\nThe strategy for the gardener will be to divide the board into $N^{2}$ disjoint $3 \\times 3$ subboards, number them $0, \\ldots, N^{2}-1$ in some order. Then, for $b=N^{2}-1, \\ldots, 0$ in order, he plays $10^{6} M(M+1)^{b}$ times on subboard number $b$. Hence, on subboard number $b$, the moves on that subboard will first ensure 5 of its trees grows by at least $10^{6}(M+1)^{b}$, and then each move after that will decrease their heights by 1 . (As the trees on subboard $b$ had height 0 before the gardener started playing there, no move made on subboards $\\geqslant b$ decreased their heights.) As the gardener makes $10^{6} M(M+1)^{b-1}+\\ldots=10^{6}\\left((M+1)^{b}-1\\right)$ moves after he finishes playing on subboard $b$, this means that on subboard $b$, there will be 5 trees of height at least $10^{6}(M+1)^{b}-10^{6}\\left((M+1)^{b}-1\\right)=10^{6}$, hence each of the subboard has 5 majestic trees, which was what we wanted.""]",OE_TO,,,

#Plan#:
1.  **Increase Constraints on Path Formation:** Replace simple adjacency (4-way) with 8-way adjacency (queen-move adjacency, including diagonals). This drastically increases potential connections and interactions.
2.  **Introduce Additional Agents/Constraints:** Introduce a second player, Bob, who *also* fills an identical board independently. They are opponents; each seeks to minimize their own path count. For Bob's board to be valid, Alice's assignment must be used.
3.  **Add Mutual Constraint & Concretize Goal:** Introduce parameters $k$ (min length for Alice) and $l$ (min length for Bob), making the path count target specific long paths. Add a high-stakes mutual constraint: Alice's *longest possible* good path must be *strictly shorter* than Bob's *shortest possible good path* (after both assignments are fixed). The goal shifts to designing both assignments to satisfy this constraint while minimizing Alice's count of good paths *of length at least $k$*.

The concrete variables $k, l$ ($k, l \leq n^2$) replace the vague ""arbitrary length"".

Obviously, this path is connected. Now, let us consider the fields $(2,6 k+s)$ and $(1,6 k+s+3)$. For each considered field $(i, j)$ we will mark all squares of the form $(l, j)$ for $l>i$ and $(i+2 k, j \\pm 1)$.

(Since needles are closed under scalar multiples and quotients, this is well-defined.)\n\nClaim. Grades are closed upwards.\n\nProof. Consider positive rationals $k_{1} / l_{1}<k_{2} / l_{2}$ with $k_{1} / l_{1}$ a grade. Then:\n\n- $\\left(k_{1}, l_{1}\\right)$ is a needle\n- so $\\left(k_{1} l_{2}, l_{1} l_{2}\\right)$ is a needle,\n- so $\\left(k_{2} l_{1}, l_{1} l_{2}\\right)$ is a needle (as $k_{2} l_{1}-k_{1} l_{2}>0$ and $(1,0)$ is a needle).\n\nThus $\\left(k_{2}, l_{2}\\right)$ is a needle, as wanted.\n\nClaim. A grade exists.\n\nProof. If no positive integer $n$ is a grade, then $f(1,0)>f(0, n)$ for all $n$ which is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, there is an $n$ such that $f(0,1)<f(n, 0)$, thus $1 / n$ is not a grade for some large $n$. That means that small positive rational values are not grades, then there is a switch, and after that all values are grades. Call the place of that switch $\\alpha$. Here $\\alpha$ is the infimum of the grades.\n\nClaim (Key property). If $x_{1}+y_{1} \\alpha>x_{2}+y_{2} \\alpha$ then $f\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)>f\\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\\right)$.\n\nProof. If both $x_{1} \\geqslant x_{2}$ and $y_{1} \\geqslant y_{2}$ this is clear.\n\nSuppose $x_{1} \\geqslant x_{2}$ and $y_{1}<y_{2}$. Then $\\frac{x_{1}-x_{2}}{y_{2}-y_{1}}>\\alpha$ is a grade.

This gives $f\\left(x_{2}, y_{2}\\right)<f\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$.\n\nFrom those observations we get the following claim.\n\nClaim. The function $f$ orders pairs $(x, y)$ based on the value of $x+y \\alpha$. If $\\alpha$ is rational, tiebreaking is done by larger $x$ - or $y$-coordinate (depending on whether $\\alpha$ is a grade).\n\n\n\nWe can imagine this the following way: take a line with slope $-\\frac{1}{\\alpha}$ under the first quadrant of the plane. And we start to move this line upward (but it stays parallel to the original line). First it hits $(0,0)$, so $f(0,0)=0$. And each time the line hits a point $p, f(p)$ is the number of points hit before. If $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, it is possible that the line hits multiple points. Then those points are ordered the same way as their $x$ or $y$ coordinates, depending on whether $\\alpha$ is a grade.\n\nWe understood the behaviour of $f$, now we need to focus on the region of $A=\\{(x, y) \\in$ $\\left.\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geqslant 0} \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geqslant 0} \\mid x<100, y<100\\right\\}$.

This introduces complexity through a nested sum dependent on the range defined by the prime pair. Note that for true twin primes (`q=p+2`), there are *no primes* between `p` and `q`, so this sum would be 0. To avoid triviality and ensure the product is non-zero and divisible only when `n` is sufficiently large relative to the pairs considered, use `1 + ?_{r prime, p < r < q} r`, which equals `1` whenever no primes exist between `p` and `q`.
3.  **Add a Modular Constraint on `n`:** Introduce an **additional arithmetic constraint** on `n`, specifically requiring `n ? 3 mod 4`, which interacts subtly with the properties of sums of primes and factorials.

    *   The core remains factorial (`n!`) divisibility (`|`) of a product over prime pairs near `n`.
    *   The product now consists of terms `(p + q) * (1 + ?_{p < r < q} r)` specifically for *twin prime pairs* `(p, q)`.

- Task: Determine all such functions.  
- Variables: Only $x$ and $y$ are involved.  
- Theme: Solving a functional equation over the rationals with constraints.  
Potential areas for complexity: Expand domain to include non-positive rationals, generalize exponents or involve additional variables, add functional constraints like surjectivity, or introduce real-world dependencies (here, amplified mathematical complexity through multiple variables and broader domains).  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
1. Expand domain to include all rational numbers (including zero and negatives) but maintain codomain as positive rationals. This introduces boundary cases (e.g., $x=0$ or $y=0$), negative inputs affecting squares, and requires consistent behavior.  
2. Introduce a third variable $z$ into the functional equation to create interdependence, increasing the number of cases and symmetry considerations. Specifically, modify the equation to $f\left( x^{2} f(y)^{2} z^{2} \right) = f(x)^{2} f(y) f(z)^{2}$ for all $x,y,z$, adding complexity due to the additional degrees of freedom.  
3. Add constraint that $f$ is surjective onto $\mathbb{Q}_{>0}$. This ensures non-trivial solutions, excludes constant functions (e.g., if constant, surjectivity fails), and demands reasoning about range.  
All elements interconnect: The expanded domain impacts equation evaluation at critical points (e.g., zero), the multi-variable equation necessitates investigating symmetry or substitution strategies, and surjectivity provides a tool for deducing function forms. Real-world constraints are mathematically incorporated via rational number properties and function equality requirements.

**#Elements Identified#:**
- **Board**: Fixed $20 \times 20$ chessboard, initially empty.
- **Players**: Horst (places black knights) and Queenie (places white queens).
- **Turn Structure**: Sequential, alternating moves starting with Horst.
- **Horst's Constraint**: Places a knight on an empty square without attacking existing knights.
- **Queenie's Action**: Places a queen on any empty square without restrictions.
- **Termination Condition**: Game ends when a player cannot make a move.
- **Objective**: Find maximal $K$ such that Horst guarantees at least $K$ knights against any Queenie strategy.
- **Key Theme**: Adversarial placement under independence constraints for knights, with queens as blockers.

Step 2    
**#Plan#:**
1. **Increase Dimensionality**: Generalize the $20 \times 20$ chessboard to an $n \times n$ board where $n \geq 4$ is even (to introduce parameterization and parity considerations).
2. **Add Constraints to Horst's Moves**: Require knights to avoid squares attacked by *existing queens* (beyond knight independence), increasing placement complexity due to queen threats.
3. **Impose Obligations on Queenie**: Force Queenie?s queen placement to attack at least one knight if possible (making Queenie proactively aggressive), with a fallback to free placement only when impossible.
4. **Refine Objective**: Express the goal as a function $K(n)$, requiring asymptotic or parameter-dependent analysis instead of a fixed number.
5. **Ensure Coherence**: Maintain core mechanics (alternating turns, independence for knights) while logically linking new constraints (queen threats affect knight placements, aggressive queen moves alter board dynamics).

Two knights on squares of the same colour never attack each other. The number of black squares is $20^{2} / 2=200$.

Notice that in a $4 \\times 4$ board the squares can be grouped into 4 cycles of length 4 , as shown in Figure 1.

#Elements Identified#:  
- **Variables**: Positive integer \(k\) determining the number of players \(2k\).  
- **Participants**: \(2k\) players; every pair must play exactly once.

- **Core structure**: Classic round-robin tournament.

#Plan#:  
1. **Modify scheduling constraint**: Instead of one match per day, allow parallel matches via a limited resource (e.g., courts), intensifying assignment complexity.  
2. **Introduce player-specific constraints**: Add a mandatory rest period (e.g., no consecutive match days), forcing non-contiguous scheduling within a player's continuous stay.  
3. **Add external dependency**: Link player arrival to group assignments, requiring preliminary rounds before cross-group matches, which extends planning.

 ""Consider any tournament schedule.

Clearly, the Committee pays for each day the cost of the match of that day. Hence, we are to minimise the total cost of all matches.\n\nNotice that $Q_{2 k}$ 's departure does not precede $P_{2 k}$ 's arrival. Hence, the number of players at the tournament monotonically increases (non-strictly) until it reaches $2 k$, and then monotonically decreases (non-strictly). So, the best time to schedule the match between $P_{i}$ and $P_{j}$ is either when $P_{\\max (i, j)}$ arrives, or when $Q_{\\max \\left(a_{i}, a_{j}\\right)}$ departs, in which case the cost is $\\min \\left(\\max (i, j), \\max \\left(a_{i}, a_{j}\\right)\\right)$.\n\nConversely, assuming that $i>j$, if this match is scheduled between the arrivals of $P_{i}$ and $P_{i+1}$, then its cost will be exactly $i=\\max (i, j)$. Similarly, one can make it cost $\\max \\left(a_{i}, a_{j}\\right)$.

First of all, let us mention that for every two points $A$ and $B$ having the same color, one can draw two lines separating these points from all other ones.

- **Conditions**:

2. **Strengthen within-tuple constraints**: Add a condition that within each quadruple, components are pairwise distinct, forcing internal uniqueness and linking component behavior.
3. **Retain distinctness across quadruples**: Extend Condition (2) to four components, ensuring each coordinate set remains distinct. Keep the sum constraint, but now for four variables.
4. **Adjust domain for consistency**: Specify $n \geq 2$ but handle $N(n)=0$ for $n<6$ implicitly, without altering the domain explicitly to maintain coherence.

#Elements Identified#:
- Board: Size (999?999, fixed square grid).
- Movement rules: The rook moves to adjacent squares (common side) with a mandatory perpendicular turn between consecutive moves.
- Route properties: Non-intersecting (pairwise different squares) and cyclic (can move directly from last to first square with perpendicular move).
- Objective: Find the maximum number of squares visited in such a cyclic non-intersecting route.
- Key constraints: The turn constraint and the cycle closure condition.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. Modify the board size and shape: Change from fixed 999?999 square to rectangular dimensions (e.g., 1000?998) to introduce parity differences and affect cycle possibilities.
2. Introduce obstacles: Add patterned obstacles (e.g., all squares where row and column indices are both divisible by 3) that block movement and complicate pathfinding.

To do this we color the cells with four colors $A, B, C$ and $D$ in the following way: for $(i, j) \\equiv(0,0) \\bmod 2$ use $A$, for $(i, j) \\equiv(0,1) \\bmod 2$ use $B$, for $(i, j) \\equiv(1,0) \\bmod 2$ use $C$ and for $(i, j) \\equiv(1,1) \\bmod 2$ use $D$. From an $A$-cell the rook has to move to a $B$-cell or a $C$-cell. In the first case, the order of the colors of the cells visited is given by $A, B, D, C, A, B, D, C, A, \\ldots$, in the second case it is $A, C, D, B, A, C, D, B, A, \\ldots$ Since the route is closed it must contain the same number of cells of each color. There are only $499^{2} A$-cells. In the following we will show that the rook cannot visit all the $A$-cells on its route and hence the maximum possible number of cells in a route is $4 \\cdot\\left(499^{2}-1\\right)$.\n\nAssume that the route passes through every single $A$-cell. Color the $A$-cells in black and white in a chessboard manner, i.e. color any two $A$-cells at distance 2 in different color. Since the number of $A$-cells is odd the rook cannot always alternate between visiting black and white $A$-cells along its route. Hence there are two $A$-cells of the same color which are four rook-steps apart that are visited directly one after the other. Let these two $A$-cells have row and column numbers $(a, b)$ and $(a+2, b+2)$ respectively.\n\n<img_3906>\n\nThere is up to reflection only one way the rook can take from $(a, b)$ to $(a+2, b+2)$. Let this way be $(a, b) \\rightarrow(a, b+1) \\rightarrow(a+1, b+1) \\rightarrow(a+1, b+2) \\rightarrow(a+2, b+2)$. Also let without loss of generality the color of the cell $(a, b+1)$ be $B$ (otherwise change the roles of columns and rows).\n\nNow consider the $A$-cell $(a, b+2)$. The only way the rook can pass through it is via $(a-1, b+2) \\rightarrow$ $(a, b+2) \\rightarrow(a, b+3)$ in this order, since according to our assumption after every $A$-cell the rook passes through a $B$-cell. Hence, to connect these two parts of the path, there must be\n\n\n\na path connecting the cell $(a, b+3)$ and $(a, b)$ and also a path connecting $(a+2, b+2)$ and $(a-1, b+2)$.\n\nBut these four cells are opposite vertices of a convex quadrilateral and the paths are outside of that quadrilateral and hence they must intersect. This is due to the following fact:\n\nThe path from $(a, b)$ to $(a, b+3)$ together with the line segment joining these two cells form a closed loop that has one of the cells $(a-1, b+2)$ and $(a+2, b+2)$ in its inside and the other one on the outside.

1.  **Modify the given angle condition:** Replace the single angle condition ?BEK=45? with the requirement that two distinct angles formed with point K are supplementary (e.g., ?BEK + another angle = 180?). This introduces simultaneous equations related to K and increases algebraic complexity.
2.  **Add an additional geometric element:** Introduce the circumcircle of an existing related triangle (e.g., ?ADC). This adds circle theorems and properties as constraints.
3.  **Add a constraint involving this element:** Constrain K relative to this circumcircle (e.g., require it to lie *on* the circumcircle). This forces strong dependencies between angles and circle properties, significantly increasing diagram complexity and reasoning steps.

#Plan#:
1.  **Modify Recurrence:** Introduce additional variables or create dependencies. Replace the single-variable recurrence with a coupled system involving two sequences \(a_k\) and \(b_k\), increasing complexity and reasoning steps. The new recurrence should maintain a rational form involving squares and constants.
2.  **Add Constraints on Boundaries:** Impose significant constraints on both the start *and* the end of the sequence, removing the implicit freedom of \(a_1\), \(a_2\), and \(a_n\), requiring them to satisfy specific prime conditions.
3.  **Add Global Constraint:** Introduce a requirement that the sequence must be *minimal* in a specific way (e.g., smallest possible largest term) among sequences of that length satisfying the other conditions, adding an extremal component.
4.  **Add Divisibility Condition:** Incorporate a divisibility condition (\(m \mid a_k\) for a new variable \(m\) related to the sequence) to deepen the number theory aspect.
5.  **Concretize/Expand Theme:** The theme evolves to finding sequences satisfying a more complex system, stricter boundaries (primes), an additional divisibility condition, and a minimality criterion.

But this is a contradiction, since then the even number $a_{2}+1$ cannot divide the odd number $a_{3}^{2}+1$.\n\nHence $a_{1}$ is even.\n\nIf $a_{2}$ is odd, $a_{3}^{2}+1$ is even (as a multiple of $a_{2}+1$ ) and hence $a_{3}$ is odd, too. Similarly we must have $a_{4}$ odd as well. But then $a_{3}^{2}+1$ is a product of two even numbers $\\left(a_{2}+1\\right)\\left(a_{4}+1\\right)$ and thus is divisible by 4 , which is a contradiction as for odd $a_{3}$ we have $a_{3}^{2}+1 \\equiv 2 \\bmod 4$.\n\nHence $a_{2}$ is even. Furthermore $a_{3}+1$ divides the odd number $a_{2}^{2}+1$ and so $a_{3}$ is even. Similarly, $a_{4}$ and $a_{5}$ are even as well.\n\nNow set $x=a_{2}$ and $y=a_{3}$. From the given condition we get $(x+1) \\mid\\left(y^{2}+1\\right)$ and $(y+1) \\mid\\left(x^{2}+1\\right)$. We will prove that there is no pair of positive even numbers $(x, y)$ satisfying these two conditions, thus yielding a contradiction to the assumption.\n\nAssume there exists a pair $\\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\\right)$ of positive even numbers satisfying the two conditions $\\left(x_{0}+1\\right) \\mid\\left(y_{0}^{2}+1\\right)$ and $\\left(y_{0}+1\\right) \\mid\\left(x_{0}^{2}+1\\right)$.\n\nThen one has $\\left(x_{0}+1\\right) \\mid\\left(y_{0}^{2}+1+x_{0}^{2}-1\\right)$, i.e., $\\left(x_{0}+1\\right) \\mid\\left(x_{0}^{2}+y_{0}^{2}\\right)$, and similarly $\\left(y_{0}+1\\right) \\mid\\left(x_{0}^{2}+y_{0}^{2}\\right)$.

If $x_{2}=0$, the second equation implies $y_{1}^{2}=k\\left(y_{1}+1\\right)$, which is impossible, as $y_{1}+1>1$ cannot divide the relatively prime number $y_{1}^{2}$. Therefore $x_{2} \\neq 0$.\n\nAlso we get $\\left(x_{1}+1\\right)\\left(x_{2}+1\\right)=x_{1} x_{2}+x_{1}+x_{2}+1=y_{1}^{2}+1$ which is odd, and hence $x_{2}$ must be even and positive.

- The relation of k-friends: two distinct points A, B in S are k-friends if there exists C in S such that the area of triangle ABC equals k.
- The k-clique: a subset T of S where every two distinct points are k-friends.
- The objective: find the minimal k such that a k-clique has size greater than 200.
- Key actions: defining k-friendship via area with external point C, and clique requiring pairwise friends.

Step 2
#Plan#:
- Restrict S to a sparser lattice: redefine S as points whose coordinates are both even integers to increase difficulty by reducing point density and constraining possible areas.
- Alter the k-clique definition: require that for every pair of points in T, the corresponding point C (from the k-friend condition) must lie within T, ensuring internal dependency and increasing density needs.
- Add a geometric constraint: impose that no three points in T are collinear to prevent zero-area triangles and force non-degenerate configurations, adding proof complexity.
- Justification: the modifications interconnect to enhance difficulty; sparser S limits candidate points, internal C requires dense subsets, and no collinearity avoids trivialities, together demanding deeper geometric reasoning.

By definition, $B=(u, v)$ satisfies this condition if and only if there is a point $C=(x, y) \\in S$ such that $\\frac{1}{2}|u y-v x|=k$. (This is a well-known formula expressing the area of triangle $A B C$ when $A$ is the origin.)\n\nTo say that there exist integers $x, y$ for which $|u y-v x|=2 k$, is equivalent to saying that the greatest common divisor of $u$ and $v$ is also a divisor of $2 k$. Summing up, a point $B=(u, v) \\in S$ is a $k$-friend of $(0,0)$ if and only if $\\operatorname{gcd}(u, v)$ divides $2 k$.\n\nTranslation by a vector with integer coordinates does not affect $k$-friendship; if two points are $k$-friends, so are their translates. It follows that two points $A, B \\in S, A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$, are $k$-friends if and only if the point $(u-s, v-t)$ is a $k$-friend of $(0,0)$; i.e., if $\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t) \\mid 2 k$.\n\nLet $n$ be a positive integer which does not divide $2 k$. We claim that a $k$-clique cannot have more than $n^{2}$ elements.\n\nIndeed, all points $(x, y) \\in S$ can be divided into $n^{2}$ classes determined by the remainders that $x$ and $y$ leave in division by $n$. If a set $T$ has more than $n^{2}$ elements, some two points $A, B \\in T, A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$, necessarily fall into the same class. This means that $n \\mid u-s$ and $n \\mid v-t$. Hence $n \\mid d$ where $d=\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t)$. And since $n$ does not divide $2 k$, also $d$ does not divide $2 k$. Thus $A$ and $B$ are not $k$-friends and the set $T$ is not a $k$-clique.\n\nNow let $M(k)$ be the least positive integer which does not divide $2 k$. Write $M(k)=m$ for the moment and consider the set $T$ of all points $(x, y)$ with $0 \\leq x, y<m$. There are $m^{2}$ of them. If $A=(s, t), B=(u, v)$ are two distinct points in $T$ then both differences $|u-s|,|v-t|$ are integers less than $m$ and at least one of them is positive. By the definition of $m$, every positive integer less than $m$ divides $2 k$. Therefore $u-s$ (if nonzero) divides $2 k$, and the same is true of $v-t$. So $2 k$ is divisible by $\\operatorname{gcd}(u-s, v-t)$, meaning that $A, B$ are $k$-friends. Thus $T$ is a $k$-clique.\n\nIt follows that the maximum size of a $k$-clique is $M(k)^{2}$, with $M(k)$ defined as above. We are looking for the minimum $k$ such that $M(k)^{2}>200$.\n\nBy the definition of $M(k), 2 k$ is divisible by the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, M(k)-1$, but not by $M(k)$ itself. If $M(k)^{2}>200$ then $M(k) \\geq 15$. Trying to hit $M(k)=15$ we get a contradiction immediately ( $2 k$ would have to be divisible by 3 and 5 , but not by 15 ).\n\nSo let us try $M(k)=16$. Then $2 k$ is divisible by the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, 15$, hence also by their least common multiple $L$, but not by 16 . And since $L$ is not a multiple of 16 , we infer that $k=L / 2$ is the least $k$ with $M(k)=16$.\n\nFinally, observe that if $M(k) \\geq 17$ then $2 k$ must be divisible by the least common multiple of $1,2, \\ldots, 16$, which is equal to $2 L$. Then $2 k \\geq 2 L$, yielding $k>L / 2$.\n\nIn conclusion, the least $k$ with the required property is equal to $L / 2=180180$.']",OE_TO,,,

So there are $N$ admissible processes, among which $M$ are restricted.\n\nIn every admissible process, restricted or not, each one of the lamps $1, \\ldots, n$ goes from off to on, so it is switched an odd number of times; and each one of the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ goes from off to off, so it is switched an even number of times.\n\nNotice that $M>0$; i.e., restricted admissible processes do exist (it suffices to switch each one of the lamps $1, \\ldots, n$ just once and then choose one of them and switch it $k-n$ times, which by hypothesis is an even number).\n\nConsider any restricted admissible process $\\mathbf{p}$. Take any lamp $\\ell, 1 \\leq \\ell \\leq n$, and suppose that it was switched $k_{\\ell}$ times. As noticed, $k_{\\ell}$ must be odd.

In any of these combinations, each one of the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ gets switched an even number of times and each one of the lamps $1, \\ldots, n$ remains switched an odd number of times, so the final state is the same as that resulting from the original process $\\mathbf{p}$.\n\nThis shows that every restricted admissible process $\\mathbf{p}$ can be modified in $2^{k-n}$ ways, giving rise to $2^{k-n}$ distinct admissible processes (with all lamps allowed).\n\nNow we show that every admissible process $\\mathbf{q}$ can be achieved in that way.

So the performed replacements have affected each lamp with a label $\\ell \\leq n$ also an even number of times; hence in the overall effect the final state of each lamp has remained the same. This means that the resulting process $\\mathbf{p}$ is admissible - and clearly restricted, as the lamps $n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ are not involved in it any more.\n\nIf we now take process $\\mathbf{p}$ and reverse all these replacements, then we obtain process $\\mathbf{q}$. These reversed replacements are nothing else than the modifications described in the foregoing paragraphs.\n\nThus there is a one-to- $\\left(2^{k-n}\\right)$ correspondence between the $M$ restricted admissible processes and the total of $N$ admissible processes.

4. Specify cell distinctness: explicitly state that all cells in the triple are distinct to resolve ambiguity.

- Participants: Player $B$ moves uniformly (passes 1 coin from every box to adjacent), Player $A$ moves selectively (chooses unaffected coins from different boxes to adjacent boxes).

- Theme: Maintaining minimum coin invariance against adversarial redistribution on a circular arrangement.

For $n=2012$ this gives $N_{\\min }=4022$.\n\na) If $N=2 n-2$ player $A$ can achieve her goal. Let her start the game with a regular distribution: $n-2$ boxes with 2 coins and 2 boxes with 1 coin. Call the boxes of the two kinds red and white respectively. We claim that on her first move $A$ can achieve a regular distribution again, regardless of $B$ 's first move $M$. She acts according as the following situation $S$ occurs after $M$ or not: The initial distribution contains a red box $R$ with 2 white neighbors, and $R$ receives no coins from them on move $M$.\n\nSuppose that $S$ does not occur. Exactly one of the coins $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ in a given red box $X$ is involved in $M$, say $c_{1}$. If $M$ passes $c_{1}$ to the right neighbor of $X$, let $A$ pass $c_{2}$ to its left neighbor, and vice versa. By doing so with all red boxes $A$ performs a legal move $M^{\\prime}$. Thus $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$ combined move the 2 coins of every red box in opposite directions. Hence after $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$ are complete each neighbor of a red box $X$ contains exactly 1 coin that was initially in $X$. So each box with a red neighbor is non-empty after $M^{\\prime}$. If initially there is a box $X$ with 2 white neighbors ( $X$ is red and unique) then $X$ receives a coin from at least one of them on move $M$ since $S$ does not occur. Such a coin is not involved in $M^{\\prime}$, so $X$ is also non-empty after $M^{\\prime}$. Furthermore each box $Y$ has given away its initial content after $M$ and $M^{\\prime}$. A red neighbor of $Y$ adds 1 coin to it; a white neighbor adds at most 1 coin because it is not involved in $M^{\\prime}$. Hence each box contains 1 or 2 coins after $M^{\\prime}$. Because $N=2 n-2$, such a distribution is regular.\n\nNow let $S$ occur after move $M$. Then $A$ leaves untouched the exceptional red box $R$. With all remaining red boxes she proceeds like in the previous case, thus making a legal move $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Box $R$ receives no coins from its neighbors on either move, so there is 1 coin in it after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Like above $M$ and $M^{\\prime \\prime}$ combined pass exactly 1 coin from every red box different from $R$ to each of its neighbors. Every box except $R$ has a red neighbor different from $R$, hence all boxes are non-empty after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Next, each box $Y$ except $R$ loses its initial content after $M$ and $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. A red neighbor of $Y$ adds at most 1 coin to it; a white neighbor also adds at most 1 coin as it does not participate in $M^{\\prime \\prime}$. Thus each box has 1 or 2 coins after $M^{\\prime \\prime}$, and the obtained distribution is regular.\n\nPlayer $A$ can apply the described strategy indefinitely, so $N=2 n-2$ enables her to succeed.\n\nb) For $N \\leq 2 n-3$ player $B$ can achieve an empty box after some move of $A$. Let $\\alpha$ be a set of $\\ell$ consecutive boxes containing a total of $N(\\alpha)$ coins. We call $\\alpha$ an $\\operatorname{arc}$ if $\\ell \\leq n-2$ and $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$. Note that $\\ell \\geq 2$ by the last condition. Moreover if both extremes of $\\alpha$ are non-empty boxes then $N(\\alpha) \\geq 2$, so that $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$ implies $\\ell \\geq 3$. Observe also that if an extreme $X$ of $\\alpha$ has more than 1 coin then ignoring $X$ yields a shorter arc. It follows that every arc contains an arc whose extremes have at most 1 coin each.\n\nGiven a clockwise labeling $1,2, \\ldots, n$ of the boxes, suppose that boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ form an arc $\\alpha$, with $\\ell \\leq n-2$ and $N(\\alpha) \\leq 2 \\ell-3$. Suppose also that all $n \\geq 7$ boxes are non-empty. Then $B$ can move so that an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$ will appear after any response of $A$.\n\n\n\nOne may assume exactly 1 coin in boxes 1 and $\\ell$ by a previous remark. Let $B$ pass 1 coin in counterclockwise direction from box 1 and box $n$, and in clockwise direction from each remaining box. This leaves $N(\\alpha)-2$ coins in the boxes of $\\alpha$. In addition, due to $3 \\leq \\ell \\leq n-2$, box $\\ell$ has exactly 1 coin $c$, the one received from box $\\ell-1$.\n\nLet player $A$ 's next move $M$ pass $k \\leq 2$ coins to boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ from the remaining ones. Only boxes 1 and $\\ell$ can receive such coins, at most 1 each. If $k<2$ then after move $M$ boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ form an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$. If $k=2$ then $M$ adds a coin to box $\\ell$. Also $M$ does not move coin $c$ from $\\ell$ because $c$ is involved in the previous move of $B$. In summary boxes $1,2, \\ldots, \\ell$ contain $N(\\alpha)$ coins like before, so they form an arc. However there are 2 coins now in the extreme $\\ell$ of the arc. Ignore $\\ell$ to obtain a shorter arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$.\n\nConsider any initial distribution without empty boxes. Since $N \\leq 2 n-3$, there are at least 3 boxes in it with exactly 1 coin. It follows from $n \\geq 7$ that some 2 of them are the extremes of an arc $\\alpha$. Hence $B$ can make the move described above, which leads to an arc $\\alpha^{\\prime}$ with $N\\left(\\alpha^{\\prime}\\right)<N(\\alpha)$ after $A^{\\prime}$ 's response. If all boxes in the new distribution are non-empty he can repeat the same, and so on. Because $N(\\alpha)$ cannot decrease indefinitely, an empty box will occur after some move of $A$.""]",OE_TO,,,

Hence $y+z=503 k$ is even too, meaning that $k$ is even. Thus $k=2$ or $k=4$. Clearly (1) has no integer solutions for $k=4$. If $k=2$ then (1) takes the form $(y+z)^{2}-5 y z=4$.

#Elements Identified#:  
- Variables: \(k\) (number of colors), function \(f: \mathbb{Z}_{>0} \to \mathbb{Z}_{>0}\), and the coloring.  
- Condition (i): Homogeneity within each color class: for all \(m, n\) of the same color, \(f(m+n) = f(m) + f(n)\).  
- Condition (ii): Non-additivity somewhere: there exist \(m, n\) such that \(f(m+n) \neq f(m) + f(n)\).  
- Participants: Positive integers \(\mathbb{Z}_{>0}\), partitioned into \(k\) color classes, and the function \(f\).

Consider $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ given by $f(n)=n$ for all $n \\equiv 1$ or 2 modulo 3 , and $f(n)=2 n$ for $n \\equiv 0$ modulo 3 . Moreover, give a positive integer $n$ the $i$-th color if $n \\equiv i(3)$.\n\nBy construction we have $f(1+2)=6 \\neq 3=f(1)+f(2)$ and hence $f$ has property (ii).\n\nNow let $n, m$ be positive integers with the same color $i$. If $i=0$, then $n+m$ has color 0 , so $f(n+m)=$ $2(n+m)=2 n+2 m=f(n)+f(m)$. If $i=1$, then $n+m$ has color 2 , so $f(n+m)=n+m=f(n)+f(m)$. Finally, if $i=2$, then $n+m$ has color 1 , so $f(n+m)=n+m=f(n)+f(m)$. Therefore $f$ also satisfies condition (i).\n\nNext we show that there is no such function and coloring for $k=2$.\n\nConsider any coloring of $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with 2 colors and any function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ satisfying conditions (i) and (ii). Then there exist positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that $f(m+n) \\neq f(m)+f(n)$. Choose $m$ and $n$ such that their sum is minimal among all such $m, n$ and define $a=m+n$. Then in particular for every $b<a$ we have $f(b)=b f(1)$ and $f(a) \\neq a f(1)$.\n\nIf $a$ is even, then condition (i) for $m=n=\\frac{a}{2}$ implies $f(a)=f\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)+f\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)=f(1) a$, a contradiction. Hence $a$ is odd. We will prove two lemmas.\n\nLemma 1. Any odd integer $b<a$ has a different color than $a$.\n\nProof. Suppose that $b<a$ is an odd integer, and that $a$ and $b$ have the same color. Then on the one hand, $f(a+b)=f(a)+b f(1)$. On the other hand, we also have $f(a+b)=f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)+f\\left(\\frac{a+b}{2}\\right)=(a+b) f(1)$, as $\\frac{a+b}{2}$ is a positive integer smaller than $a$. Hence $f(a)=f(a+b)-b f(1)=(a+b) f(1)-b f(1)=a f(1)$, which is again a contradiction. Therefore all odd integers smaller than $a$ have a color different from that of $a$.\n\nLemma 2. Any even integer $b<a$ has the same color as a\n\nProof. Suppose $b<a$ is an even integer, and that $a$ and $b$ have different colors. Then $a-b$ is an odd integer smaller than $a$, so it has the same color as $b$. Thus $f(a)=f(a-b)+f(b)=(a-b) f(1)+b f(1)=a f(1)$, a contradiction. Hence all even integers smaller than $a$ have the same color as $a$.\n\nSuppose now $a+1$ has the same color as $a$. As $a>1$, we have $\\frac{a+1}{2}<a$ and therefore $f(a+1)=2 f\\left(\\frac{a+1}{2}\\right)=$ $(a+1) f(1)$. As $a-1$ is an even integer smaller than $a$, we have by Lemma 2 that $a-1$ also has the same color as $a$. Hence $2 f(a)=f(2 a)=f(a+1)+f(a-1)=(a+1) f(1)+(a-1) f(1)=2 a f(1)$, which implies that $f(a)=a f(1)$, a contradiction. So $a$ and $a+1$ have different colors.\n\nSince $a-2$ is an odd integer smaller than $a$, by Lemma 1 it has a color different from that of $a$, so $a-2$ and $a+1$ have the same color. Also, we have seen by Lemma 2 that $a-1$ and $a$ have the same color. So $f(a)+f(a-1)=f(2 a-1)=f(a+1)+f(a-2)=(a+1) f(1)+(a-2) f(1)=(2 a-1) f(1)$, from which it follows that $f(a)=(2 a-1) f(1)-f(a-1)=(2 a-1) f(1)-(a-1) f(1)=a f(1)$, which contradicts our choice of $a$ and finishes the proof.'
 'We prove that $k \\leq 3$ just as in first solution.\n\nNext we show that there is no such function and coloring for $k=2$.\n\nConsider any coloring of $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with 2 colors and any function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ satisfying conditions (i) and (ii). We first notice with $m=n$ that $f(2 n)=2 f(n)$.\n\nLemma 3. For every $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}, f(3 n)=3 f(n)$ holds.\n\nProof. Define $c=f(n), d=f(3 n)$. Then we have the relations\n\n$$\nf(2 n)=2 c, \\quad f(4 n)=4 c, \\quad f(6 n)=2 d\n$$\n\n- If $n$ and $2 n$ have the same color, then $f(3 n)=f(n)+f(2 n)=3 c=3 f(n)$.\n- If $n$ and $3 n$ have the same color, then $4 c=f(4 n)=f(n)+f(3 n)=c+f(3 n)$, so $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n- If $2 n$ and $4 n$ have the same color, then $2 d=f(6 n)=f(2 n)+f(4 n)=2 c+4 c=6 c$, so $f(3 n)=d=3 c$.\n- Otherwise $n$ and $4 n$ have the same color, and $2 n$ and $3 n$ both have the opposite color to $n$. Therefore we compute $5 c=f(n)+f(4 n)=f(5 n)=f(2 n)+f(3 n)=2 c+f(3 n)$ so $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n\nConsequently, for $k=2$ we necessarily have $f(3 n)=3 f(n)$.\n\nNow let $a$ be the smallest integer such that $f(a) \\neq a f(1)$. In particular $a$ is odd and $a>3$. Consider the three integers $a, \\frac{a-3}{2}, \\frac{a+3}{2}$. By pigeonhole principle two of them have the same color.\n\n- If $\\frac{a-3}{2}$ and $\\frac{a+3}{2}$ have the same color, then $f(a)=\\frac{a-3}{2} f(1)+\\frac{a+3}{2} f(1)=a f(1)$.\n- If $a$ and $\\frac{a-3}{2}$ have the same color, then $3 \\frac{a-1}{2} f(1)=3 f\\left(\\frac{a-1}{2}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{3 a-3}{2}\\right)=f(a)+f\\left(\\frac{a-3}{2}\\right)=f(a)+$ $\\frac{a-3}{2} f(1)$, so $f(a)=a f(1)$.\n- If $a$ and $\\frac{a+3}{2}$ have the same color, then $3 \\frac{a+1}{2} f(1)=3 f\\left(\\frac{a+1}{2}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{3 a+3}{2}\\right)=f(a)+f\\left(\\frac{a+3}{2}\\right)=f(a)+$ $\\frac{a+3}{2} f(1)$, so $f(a)=a f(1)$.\n\nIn the three cases we find a contradiction with $f(a) \\neq a f(1)$, so it finishes the proof.'
 'As before we prove that $k \\leq 3$ and for any such function and colouring we have $f(2 n)=2 f(n)$.\n\nNow we show that there is no such function and coloring for $k=2$.\n\nConsider any coloring of $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ with 2 colors and any function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ satisfying conditions (i) and (ii). Say the two colors are white (W) and black (B). Pick $m, n$ any two integers such that $f(m+n)=f(m)+f(n)$. Without loss of generality we may assume that $m+n, m$ are black and $n$ is white.\n\nLemma 4. For all $l \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ and every $x$ whose color is black, we have $x+l m$ is black and $f(x+\\operatorname{lm})=$ $f(x)+l f(m)$.\n\nProof. We proceed by induction. It is clearly true for $l=0$. If $x+l m$ is black and satisfies $f(x+l m)=$ $f(x)+l f(m)$, then $f(x+(l+1) m)=f(x+l m)+f(m)=f(x)+(l+1) f(m)$ and $f(x+(l+1) m+n)=$ $f(x+l m)+f(m+n)=f(x)+l f(m)+f(m+n) \\neq f(x)+(l+1) f(m)+f(n)=f(x+(l+1) m)+f(n)$, so $x+(l+1) m$ is not the same color of $n$, therefore $x+(l+1) m$ is black. Thjs completes the induction.\n\nIn particular we then must have that $2^{l} n$ is white for every $l$, because otherwise since $2^{l} m$ is black we would have $2^{l} f(m+n)=f\\left(2^{l} m+2^{l} n\\right)=f\\left(2^{l} m\\right)+f\\left(2^{l} n\\right)=2^{l}(f(m)+f(n))$, and consequently $f(m+n)=$ $f(m)+f(n)$.\n\nLemma 5. For every $l \\geq 1,2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n$ is black.\n\n\n\nProof. On the one hand we have $2^{l} f(m+n)=f\\left(2^{l} m+2^{l} n\\right)=f\\left(2^{l-1}(2 m+n)+2^{l-1} n\\right)$. On the other hand we have\n\n$\\left.2^{l} f(m+n)=2^{l-1} \\cdot 2 f(m+n) \\neq 2^{l-1}(f(m+n)+f(m)+f(n))=2^{l-1}(f(2 m+n)+f(n))=f\\left(2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n\\right)\\right)+f\\left(2^{l-1} n\\right)$.\n\nTherefore $2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n$ and $2^{l-1} n$ have different color, which means $2^{l} m+2^{l-1} n$ is black.\n\nCombining the two lemmas give $j m+2^{l-1} n$ is black for all $j \\geq 2^{l}$ and every $l \\geq 1$.\n\nNow write $m=2^{l-1} m^{\\prime}$ with $m^{\\prime}$ odd. Let $t$ be a number such that $\\frac{2^{t}-1}{m^{\\prime}}$ is an integer and $j=\\frac{2^{t}-1}{m^{\\prime}} n \\geq 2^{l}$, i.e. $t$ is some multiple of $\\phi\\left(m^{\\prime}\\right)$. Then we must have that $j m+2^{l-1} n$ is black, but by definition $j m+2^{l-1} n=$ $\\left(2^{t}-1\\right) 2^{l-1} n+2^{l-1} n=2^{t+l-1} n$ is white.

#Elements Identified#:

- **Initial Setup**: Jury chooses the starting queue order.  
- **Move Selection**: Each minute, Jury picks an integer $i$ ($1 \leq i \leq n$) to select contestant $C_i$.

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
1. **Introduce parameterized contestant types** (e.g., type A and B) chosen by the Jury, affecting move conditions and payments. This adds combinatorial assignments and coupling between type, move criteria, and payoff.  
2. **Vary movement dynamics** based on type: Type A retains the original move condition and payment, while Type B requires stricter conditions (e.g., $2i$ contestants in front) but pays more (e.g., 2 euros). This increases strategic depth in type assignments and move sequences.  
3. **Add move-exclusivity constraints**: Restrict consecutive moves to prevent choosing the same $i$ index twice in a row, forcing adaptive sequencing and interdependence between moves.

We argue by induction. Let us assume that the Jury can collect $M_{n}$ euros in a configuration with $n$ contestants. Then we show that the Jury can collect at least $2 M_{n}+n$ moves in a configuration with $n+1$ contestants. Indeed, let us begin with all the contestants lined up in reverse order. In the first $M_{n}$ moves the Jury keeps $C_{n+1}$ in first position and reverses the order of the remaining contestants, then in the next $n$ moves all contestants $C_{1}, \\ldots, C_{n}$ (in this order) jump over $C_{n+1}$ and end up in the first $n$ positions of the line in reverse order, and finally in the last $M_{n}$ moves the Jury rearranges the first $n$ positions.\n\nSince $M_{1}=0$ and $M_{n+1} \\geq 2 M_{n}+n$, an easy induction shows that $M_{n} \\geq 2^{n}-n-1$.\n\n<img_3565>\n\nLet us show now that at most $2^{n}-n-1$ moves are possible.

Similarly, $b=0$ gives the solutions $(a, b, c)=(1,0,1)$ and $(a, b, c)=(-1,0,-1)$, while $c=0$ gives $(a, b, c)=(1,1,0)$ and $(a, b, c)=(-1,-1,0)$.\n\nNow we may assume that $a, b, c \\neq=0$.

3. **Coverage Rule**: Every cell must be adjacent to exactly one domino-covered cell.
4. **Adjacency Definition**: Cells sharing a common side.
5. **Objective Function**: Maximize the number of dominoes for each \(n\).
6. **Constraint Simplicity**: Standard domino placement with no overlapping or gaps.
7. **Input**: Only \(n\) (positive integer) is given.
8. **Theme**: Tiling/domino placement with isolated coverage conditions.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. **Modify Grid Size**: Replace \(2n \times 2n\) with asymmetric dimensions \(m \times k\), defined as parametric expressions of \(n\) that maintain even dimensions but introduce uneven scaling and residue dependencies. Specifically, set \(m = 2n + 2\lfloor n/3 \rfloor\) and \(k = 2n - 2\lfloor n/4 \rfloor\).
2. **Augment Coverage Rules**: Require every domino to have a specific orientation relative to adjacent dominoes. Specifically, mandate that if a domino is placed vertically, its adjacent dominoes (sharing a full edge) must include at least one horizontal domino, and vice versa.
3. **Complicate Objective**: Change the target to maximize a function of the tile count, such as the expression \(\left\lfloor m \sqrt{k}/2 \right\rfloor - (n \mod 2)\), which links the solution to modular arithmetic, irrationality, and floor operations.
4. **Add Input Constraints**: Introduce parameters \(p\) and \(q\) derived from \(n\) (e.g., \(p = 2\lfloor n/3 \rfloor\), \(q = 2\lfloor n/4 \rfloor\)) to define \(m\) and \(k\), ensuring dimensional dependencies.

The proof naturally splits into two parts: we first prove that $n(n+1) / 2$ dominoes can be placed on the board, and then show that $M \\leq n(n+1) / 2$ to complete the proof. To prove that $M \\leq$ $n(n+1) / 2$, we again border the $2 n \\times 2 n$ square board up to a $(2 n+2) \\times(2 n+2)$ square board. In fact, we shall ignore the corner border cells as they cannot be covered anyway and consider only the $2 n$ border cells along each side. We prove that out of each four border cells next to each other at most two can be covered. Suppose three out of four cells $A, B, C, D$ are covered.

So when $n$ is even, at most $n$ of the $2 n$ border cells along one side can be covered, and when $n$ is odd, at most $n+1$ out of the $2 n$ border cells can be covered. For all four borders together, this gives a contribution of $4 n$ when $n$ is even and $4 n+4$ when $n$ is odd. Adding $4 n^{2}$ and dividing by 8 we get the desired result.'

Indeed, if one of the sides the square had three rectangles adjacent to it, removing these three rectangles would leave a polygon with eight vertices, which is clearly not the union of two rectangles. Moreover, since $m>10$, each side of the square has at least two adjacent rectangles.

If an outer rectangle has a side of length $s$, then some adjacent outer rectangle must have a side of length $12-s$. Therefore, neither of $s=1$ or $s=6$ can be sidelengths of an outer rectangle, so the inner rectangle must have dimensions $1 \\times 6$. One of the outer rectangles (say $R_{1}$ ) must have dimensions $10 \\times x$, and an adjacent rectangle (say $R_{2}$ ) must thus have dimensions $2 \\times y$. Rectangle $R_{3}$ then has dimensions $(12-y) \\times z$, and rectangle $R_{4}$ has dimensions $(12-z) \\times(12-x)$. Note that exactly one of the three numbers $x, y, z$ is even (and equals 4 or 8 ), while the other two numbers are odd.

Consider the set of all length- $k$ strings containing only $A \\mathrm{~s}$ and $B \\mathrm{~s}$ which end with a $B$, and remove the string consisting of $k$  $B \\mathrm{~s}$. Clearly there are 2 independent choices for each of the first $k-1$ letters and 1 for the last letter, and since exactly one string is excluded, there must be exactly $2^{k-1}-1$ strings in this set.\n\nSuppose Lexi tries to fill her grid. For each row to have a valid string, it must end in a $B$. But then the right column would necessarily contain $k B \\mathrm{~s}$, and not be in our set. Thus, Lexi cannot fill her grid with our set, and we must have $m \\geqslant 2^{k-1}$.\n\nNow, consider any set $\\mathcal{S}$ with at least $2^{k-1}$ strings. Clearly, if $\\mathcal{S}$ contained either the uniform string with $k A \\mathrm{~s}$ or the string with $k B \\mathrm{~s}$, then Lexi could fill her grid with all of the relevant letters and each row and column would contain that string.\n\nConsider the case where $\\mathcal{S}$ contains neither of those strings. Among all $2^{k}$ possible length$k$ strings with $A \\mathrm{~s}$ and $B \\mathrm{~s}$, each has a complement which corresponds to the string with $B$ s in every position where first string had $A$ s and vice-versa. Clearly, the string with all $A$ s is paired with the string with all $B$ s. We may assume that we do not take the two uniform strings and thus applying the pigeonhole principle to the remaining set of strings, we must have two strings which are complementary.\n\nLet this pair of strings be $\\ell, \\ell^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{S}$ in some order. Define the set of indices $\\mathcal{J}$ corresponding to the $A \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell$ and thus the $B \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell^{\\prime}$, and all other indices (not in $\\mathcal{J}$ ) correspond to $B \\mathrm{~s}$ in $\\ell$ (and thus $A$ s in $\\ell^{\\prime}$ ). Then, we claim that Lexi puts an $A$ in the cell in row $r$, column $c$ if $r, c \\in \\mathcal{J}$ or $r, c \\notin \\mathcal{J}$, and a $B$ otherwise, each row and column contains a string in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nWe illustrate this with a simple example: If $k=6$ and we have that $A A A B A B$ and $B B B A B A$ are both in the dictionary, then Lexi could fill the table as follows:\n\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| B | B | B | A | B | A |\n| A | A | A | B | A | B |\n| B | B | B | A | B | A |\n\nSuppose we are looking at row $i$ or column $i$ for $i \\in \\mathcal{J}$. Then by construction the string in this row/column contains $A \\mathrm{~s}$ at indices $k$ with $k \\in \\mathcal{J}$ and $B$ s elsewhere, and thus is precisely $\\ell$. Suppose instead we are looking at row $i$ or column $i$ for $i \\notin \\mathcal{J}$. Then again by construction the string in this row/column contains $A$ s at indices $k$ with $k \\notin \\mathcal{J}$ and $B$ s elsewhere, and thus is precisely $\\ell^{\\prime}$. So each row and column indeed contains a string in $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nThus, for any $\\mathcal{S}$ with $|\\mathcal{S}| \\geqslant 2^{k-1}$, Lexi can definitely fill the grid appropriately.

#Elements Identified#:
- **Variables**: \(x\), \(y\), and the parameter \(k\).
- **Conditions**: The curves do not intersect, meaning no real solutions to the equation derived from setting the functions equal.
- **Participants**: The two functions: one is a quadratic (\(y = x^2 - 4\)), the other is an absolute value function with a vertical shift (\(y = 2|x| + k\)).
- **Actions**: Solve for all \(k\) where no intersection occurs, with justification required.
- **Theme**: Finding parameter values for which a parabolic and an absolute value curve do not intersect, with algebraic and case-based reasoning.
- **Structure**: A direct algebraic problem that can be simplified using symmetry and substitution.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. **Increase functional complexity**: Change the first function from \(y = x^2 - 4\) to \(y = |x^2 - 4|\), introducing piecewise behavior and additional critical points (at \(x = \pm 2\)), requiring piecewise-defined equation solving.
2. **Modify the absolute value function**: Alter \(y = 2|x| + k\) to \(y = 2|x - 1| + k\), adding a horizontal shift (at \(x = 1\)) that removes symmetry, thus increasing the number of cases for analysis.
3. **Enhance reasoning requirements**: Mandate detailed case analysis by specifying that justification must explicitly cover intervals defined by critical points (\(x = -2, x = 1, x = 2\)) and address dependent behavior around these points. This refines the action from simple solving to multi-step, interconnected case handling.
- **Coherence**: All modifications interlock; the piecewise and shifted functions create dependencies where \(k\) affects intersection existence differently in each interval, increasing algebraic and logical depth while keeping \(k\) the primary variable for solution. Real-world constraints or additional parameters are avoided to prevent ambiguity.

1. **Replace square with non-square rectangle** to vary dimensions and disrupt symmetry.  
2. **Generalize parabola roots** from fixed \((2,6)\) to variables \((p, q)\) where \(q\) depends on \(p\), removing symmetry and adding a parameter.  
3. **Replace fixed area constant with a fractional value** of the rectangle's area, introducing a dependency between geometry and area constraint.  
- Specifically: use rectangle \(O(0,0), P(0,12), Q(10,12), R(10,0)\) to avoid scaling conflicts. Root symmetry about the center: \(p\) variable, \(q = 10 - p\). Area constraint: \(\frac{5}{12} \times \text{area of rectangle}\).

- The sequences: Each row and each column forms an arithmetic sequence with common differences dependent on the row or column index.  
- Position specification: Directly given as 50th row and 40th column.  
- Key properties: First row and first column have identical initial entries and common difference, both starting from 4 with difference 3.  
- Theme: Construction of a special infinite table through arithmetic sequences linked to primality sieving, requiring derivation of the general term.  

Step 2

This adds a layer of index calculation using table properties.  
2. Introduce dependencies between table components: Link the row index to the first column's sequence and the column index to the first row's sequence, enforcing cross-referencing and ensuring coherence with the arithmetic sequences.  
3. Increase reasoning depth by requiring initial computation of sequence terms: Forces derivation of the first column's 50th term and first row's 40th term before finding the target entry, using the known common difference.

#Elements Identified#:
*   **Starting Point:** (0,0)
*   **Moves:** Sequential, numbered n=1,2,3,...
*   **Turning Behavior:** Turns 90 clockwise from previous heading at the start of each new move.
*   **Move Length:** Length of move n is n units.
*   **Direction Sequence:** Moves cycle: Up (Y+), Right (X+), Down (Y-), Left (X-).
*   **Known Quantity:** Total distance traveled = 55 units.
*   **Objective:** Find position (x, y) after n moves fulfilling total distance.
*   **Theme:** Displacement via cyclic directional changes with linearly increasing step sizes.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Increase Angular Complexity:** Replace fixed 90 clockwise turn with a turn angle that increases incrementally by a fixed amount  each move. This creates an outward spiral path instead of a closed pattern. (e.g., Turn = 90 + (n-1)*)
2.  **Vary Move Length:** Instead of fixed n units, define the length of move n as proportional to the distance from the origin *before* the move starts, plus an increasing linear term. This makes the step size dependent on the entire path history. (e.g., Length_n = k * (x_{n-1}2 + y_{n-1}2) + f(n), where f(n) could be linear or quadratic).
3.  **Modify Known Quantity & Objective:** Change the condition from knowing the *total distance traveled* (which simplifies to n(n+1)/2=55) to finding *when the distance from the origin is maximized* for a given move number n. This requires tracking the radial distance throughout the complex path and finding its peak.
4.  **Ensure Interconnection:** The variable turn angle continuously alters the direction, causing a spiral. The modified step length depends directly on the current radial position (which depends on all previous turns and steps) and adds complexity. The maximization objective logically follows from the path generated by the interdependent turning and stepping mechanics.

#Elements Identified#:
1.  **Variables:** Ages of Qing (Q), Rayna (R), Paolo (P).
2.  **Conditions:**

    *   Q = P - 4 (Qing is 4 years younger than Paolo)
    *   (P + Q + R) / 3 = 13 (Average age of P, Q, R is 13)

4.  **Actions/Processes:** Relating ages directly, calculating average with a fixed number of people.

#Plan#:
1.  **Add Participants:** Introduce ""Paolo's younger brother, Marco"". This increases the number of variables and the size of the average calculation.
2.  **Modify Average Scope:** Change the average to include Marco (i.e., Paolo, Qing, Rayna, **and** Marco). This increases complexity through the expanded average equation.
3.  **Add Indirect/Temporal Condition:** Relate Marco's age to Paolo's age at a specific past event (Marco's birth). Replace the simple ""Q = P - 4"" with ""Marco was born when Paolo was 3/5 of his current age"". This:
    *   Introduces a fractional relationship (3/5).

#Elements Identified#:

*   **Sequences:**
    *   **Sequence 1:** Geometric, terms: N1 = 4. Sum provided: S4 = $6 + 6\sqrt{2}$.
    *   **Sequence 2:** Geometric, terms: N2 = 8. Sum provided: S8 = $30 + 30\sqrt{2}$.

*   **Key Condition:** Sum formulas link sequences to $a$ and $r$. The problem requires solving these equations simultaneously for possible $a$.
*   **Core Task:** Determine all possible real values for $a$.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Introduce Sub-Sequence Sums:** Instead of directly giving S4 and S8, provide the sum of the first 4 terms *and* the sum of the first 3 terms for the same initial sequence. Similarly, for the longer sequence, provide the sum of the first 8 terms *and* the sum of the first 7 terms. This introduces two new sums (S3 and S7) while keeping the core sums (S4 and S8). This forces deriving the relationship between S4 and S3 ($a_4 = S4 - S3$) and between S8 and S7 ($a_8 = S8 - S7$), adding layers.
2.  **Abstract the Constant:** Replace the explicit constants ($6$ and $30$) with an abstract positive irrational constant $b$. This obscures the direct proportionality present in the original problem.
3.  **Increase Calculation Steps:** Require solving for $r$ first or finding the ratio of sums explicitly before finding $a$. This necessitates using the relationship between S4 and S7/S8 derived from the sequence definition.

If each linear dimension is increased by \(n\%\) and each resolution is decreased by \(2n\%\), the image has 328,125 pixels. Determine \(n\).","### Step 1  
**#Elements Identified#**:  
- Variables: original dimensions (width and height in cm), horizontal and vertical resolutions (pixels/cm), percentage change (\(n\)), original pixel count, new pixel count.  
- Processes: Increase in linear dimensions by \(n\%\), decrease in resolutions by \(2n\%\), calculation of total pixels before and after changes.  
- Constraints: Symmetric change in linear dimensions (both width and height increased by same \(n\%\)), symmetric change in resolutions (both horizontal and vertical resolutions decreased by same \(2n\%\)), relationship between percentage changes.  
- Theme: Digital image properties and proportional changes affecting total pixel count.  

### Step 2  
**#Plan#**:  
1. **Introduce distinct resolutions**: Separate horizontal and vertical resolutions instead of a single symmetric resolution. Use different values (80 pixels/cm horizontal, 70 pixels/cm vertical) to require handling of distinct components.  
2. **Modify percentage dependency**: Change the resolution decrease to \(2n\%\) while keeping the dimension increase at \(n\%\), introducing a multiplicative factor (2x) in the decrease magnitude.  
3. **Adjust constants for exact solvability**: Set original dimensions as 10 cm ~ 15 cm, resolutions as 80 and 70 pixels/cm respectively (original pixel count becomes 840,000). Set new pixel count to 328,125, derived from solving \(16x^2 + 8x - 3 = 0\) (resulting in \(n = 25\)), ensuring integer percentage solution and algebraic complexity.  
4. **Maintain coherence**: Ensure resolutions are independently specified, and changes are symmetrically applied within their categories. The change dependency (\(2n\%\)) increases algebraic complexity while preserving logical cause-effect relationships.

Step 2
#Plan#:
- Increase n from 4 to 5 to expand the number of variables and sums, raising complexity due to more equations and potential solutions (m increases from 6 to 10, demanding richer reasoning).
- Introduce the constraint that all integers in the list must be distinct positive integers to eliminate duplicates, adding a step of ensuring uniqueness and increasing constraints on solutions.
- Modify the input by introducing an error in one pairwise sum: specify that one given \(s_i\) is incorrect, requiring identification and correction before reconstruction, which adds error handling and logical deduction.
Ensure modifications are interconnected: The larger n makes error detection harder, the distinctness constraint influences the correction step, and the error itself demands validation of consistency.

2.  **Introduce an Additional Requirement on the Divisors:** Require the divisor to be a *perfect cube* in addition to a perfect square, making it a sixth power. This adds a layer of combinatorial constraint (exponents must be multiples of 6).
3.  **Add Constraints on the Divisors:** Impose that these special divisors (sixth powers) must satisfy two separate congruence conditions simultaneously (leaving specific remainders when divided by two different primes, like 7 and 11). This requires solving systems of congruences for the divisors.

2.   Finite range: Values of `f(n)` evaluated for `n` from 1 to 2014.
3.   Target property: Determining how many of these `f(n)` values themselves have a units digit of 1.
4.   Core mathematical concept: Using combinatorics (stars and bars with inclusion of leading digit constraint) to compute `f(n)`.
5.   Analysis of periodicity: The units digit sequence of `f(n)` likely exhibits periodic behavior modulo 10 based on generating functions.

Step 2
**#Plan#:**
1.   **Modify the digit sum constraint:** Change the fixed digit sum ""5"" to a linear function of `n`, specifically ""2n"". This makes the sum grow with `n`, requiring analysis dependent on `n`.
2.   **Change the target property for `f(n)`:** Instead of just the units digit of `f(n)`, make the target property involve a computation on the index `k` at which `f(k)` is evaluated. Require finding `f(k)` values where `k` itself has a digit sum congruent to 2 modulo 3.
3.   **Expand the range and add a modular condition:** Change the finite range (1 to 2014) to an infinite range (`n >= 1`) but restrict `n` with a modular condition (`n ? 3 mod 4`). This forces consideration of periodicity within a residue class.
4.   **Add concrete digit constraints:** Impose the condition that all digits must be non-zero. This significantly alters the combinatorial calculation for `f(n)`.

Since a total of five 1s are used, then each arrangement corresponds with an integer with $n$ digits whose digits have a sum of 5 . Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the integers and arrangements with the desired properties.\n\nThus, $f(n)$, which equals the number of such integers, also equals the number of such arrangements.\n\nTo count the number of such arrangements, we note that there are four 1 s and $n-1 \\mathrm{Xs}$ to arrange in the final $4+(n-1)=n+3$ positions, since the first position is occupied by a 1 .\n\nThere are $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)$ ways to choose the positions of the remaining four 1s, and so $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)$ arrangements.\n\nThus, $f(n)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n+3 \\\\ 4\\end{array}\\right)=\\frac{(n+3) !}{4 !(n-1) !}=\\frac{(n+3)(n+2)(n+1)(n)}{4 !}=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the positive integers $n$ between 1 and 2014, inclusive, for which the units digit of $f(n)$ is 1 .\n\nNow $f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$ is an integer for all positive integers $n$, since it is counting the number of things with a certain property.\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 0 or 5 , then $n$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 2 or 7 , then $n+3$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 3 or 8 , then $n+2$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nIf the units digit of $n$ is 4 or 9 , then $n+1$ is a multiple of 5 .\n\nThus, if the units digit of $n$ is $0,2,3,4,5,7,8$, or 9 , then $n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)$\n\nis a multiple of 5 and so $f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$ is a multiple of 5 , since the denominator contains no factors of 5 that can divide the factor from the numerator.\n\nTherefore, if the units digit of $n$ is $0,2,3,4,5,7,8$, or 9 , then $f(n)$ is divisible by 5 , and so cannot have a units digit of 1 .\n\nSo we consider the cases where $n$ has a units digit of 1 or of 6 ; these are the only possible values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ can have a units digit of 1 .\n\nWe note that $3 f(n)=\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8}$, which is a positive integer for all positive integers $n$.\n\n\n\nAlso, we note that if $f(n)$ has units digit 1 , then $3 f(n)$ has units digit 3 , and if $3 f(n)$ has units digit 3 , then $f(n)$ must have units digit 1 .\n\nTherefore, determining the values of $n$ for which $f(n)$ has units digit 1 is equivalent to determining the values of $n$ for which $\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{8}$ has units digit 3 .\n\nWe consider the integers $n$ in groups of 40 .

*   **Target**: Probability of rolling a specific number (2) on *one specific subsequent roll* (the second roll).
*   **State Change**: The die's face values change deterministically once based on the first roll.
*   **Variables**: Face values before and after transformation; possible outcomes of each roll.

**#Plan#**:
1.  **Increase Transformation Complexity**: Replace the simple group-based operation (double all odd/halve all even) with *individual, position-specific transformations* involving *different arithmetic operations* (e.g., add/subtract/multiply by specific values, conditional on the face showing). Base the transformations on both the *face value* and its *physical orientation* after a rotation.
2.  **Introduce Spatial Mechanics**: Require physical manipulation *beyond* checking the top face. Mandate rotating the die to a new orientation after the roll *before* applying transformations.
3.  **Extend the Sequence**: Move the probability target calculation to a *third roll*, requiring chaining through two transformations and rolls, significantly increasing the state space and dependencies. The transformation rules remain active after each roll.
4.  **Modify Transformation Trigger/Effect**: Effectively merge points 1 and 2: After a roll, *rotate the die 90? clockwise* around a specified axis, observe the *new* top face, and apply a *value-specific* operation to *all* faces (e.g., ""if rotated top face is less than 4, add 1; else if greater than 5, subtract 1; else multiply by 2"").

#Elements Identified#:
*   **Participants:** Seven cricket teams with given stats (W, Losses, D, A, B, Points).
*   **Scoring Variables:** Points per event: `w` (win), `d` (draw), `a` (bonus bowling), `b` (bonus batting).
*   **Constraints:** `w, d, a, b` are positive integers. Total matches per team = 17. Points formula: `P = w*W + d*D + a*A + b*B`.
*   **Data:** Provides specific numerical values for W, Losses, D, A, B, and total Points for each team.
*   **Goal:** Determine the unique values of `w, d, a, b` using the provided data.

*   **Manipulable Aspects:** Number of unknown scoring elements, types of constraints, relationship between `W, D, Losses`, introducing non-positive elements, coupling points.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Add Penalty Variable:** Introduce a new penalty event (e.g., Slow Over Rate, denoted `S`) with a corresponding **negative** integer point value `s` deducted from the total points. Add a column `S` to the table for penalty occurrences per team.
2.  **Modify Bonus Points:** Instead of simple `a* A + b*B`, make bonus points more complex. Replace `a` and `b` with **rational number multipliers** `?` and `?`, applied only to a *subset* of the raw bonus counts `A` and `B`. Specifically, define: *Batting Bonus Points = ? * (B - P)*, *Bowling Bonus Points = ? * (A - O)* where `P` is a fixed threshold for batting penalty, and `O` is a fixed threshold for bowling penalty (assign plausible `P`, `O` values). `?` and `?` must be determined.
3.  **Add Constraint Ratios:** Introduce explicit ratio constraints between the fundamental point values: `w / d = R1` and `a / b = R2`, where `R1` and `R2` are given specific rational numbers, requiring the determined `w, d, a, b` (or their rational equivalents) to satisfy these ratios exactly.
4.  **Integrate Loss Column:** Make the Losses column functionally relevant beyond checking match totals. State explicitly that the total of `W + Losses + D = 17` **must be verified for all teams** before solving, potentially revealing inconsistencies needing resolution (e.g., off-by-one data error, difference must equal penalty count `S`).
5.  **Ensure Interconnection:** Penalties (`S, s`) and modified bonuses (`?, ?, P, O`) are directly embedded in the new points formula. The ratio constraints (`R1`, `R2`) rigidly couple `w` & `d` and `a` & `b` (or `?` & `?`). Loss verification ensures data validity prerequisite.

- Exponential bases: 3 and 9  
- Exponents: \( (x-1) \) and \( \frac{3}{2x^{2}} \)  
- Right-hand side constant: 27  
- Implicit conditions: Domain of \( x \) excludes points where the expression is undefined (e.g., \( x = 0 \) causes division by zero in the exponent)  
- Core theme: Solving an exponential equation by simplification using common bases (e.g., expressing 9 and 27 as powers of 3).  
- Manipulable aspects: Complexity can be increased by adding variables, altering exponents for nonlinearity, introducing parameters or dependencies, or adding constraints like inequalities or dependencies between terms.

#Plan#:  
1. **Modify exponents for nonlinear complexity**: Change the linear exponent \( (x-1) \) to a quadratic \( (x^2 - 4) \) to introduce multiple roots and require solving a higher-degree equation after simplification.  
2. **Incorporate a parameter to add dependency**: Replace the constant 3 in the numerator of the second exponent with the mathematical constant \( e \) (base of natural logarithm), introducing a transcendental element that necessitates handling exponential-logarithmic relations.  
3. **Add a real-world-inspired constraint**: Require \( x > 0 \) to ensure the expression is defined (due to \( e/x^2 \) and implicit log considerations if needed) and to model scenarios like growth rates where variables must be positive.  
4. **Ensure interconnectedness and justification**: The changes maintain the exponential theme while increasing reasoning depth (solving a quartic equation via substitution, handling parameters, and domain constraints).

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Add Triangle Type Classification:** Modify `T(n)` to count only triangles classified as **acute** (where the square of each side is less than the sum of the squares of the other two). This adds geometric constraint beyond the triangle inequality and requires checking `a2 + b2 > c2`, `a2 + c2 > b2`, `b2 + c2 > a2` for sides a, b, c.
2.  **Add Number Theory Constraint:** Impose the condition that the side lengths `(a, b, c)` are **pairwise coprime** (gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, c) = gcd(b, c) = 1). This adds a non-trivial number-theoretic layer and dependency.
3.  **Add Symmetry/Shape Constraint:** Require the triangles to be **isosceles** (at least two sides equal). This simplifies the search space slightly but requires careful reasoning about degenerate cases and ensures the side condition manifests meaningfully with coprimality. Combine this and the above points as the new conditions for `T(n)`.
4.  **Focus Calculation:** Instead of three different perimeters, require calculation for **only one perimeter (`n=12`)**. This allows focusing computational effort but requires handling a larger, more complex set of potential triangles under the stricter conditions.
5.  **Theme:** Maintain the core theme of enumerating integer-sided triangles under a perimeter constraint, adding significant geometric (acute angles), shape-related (isosceles), and number-theoretic (pairwise coprime) filtering.

- T(n): The function counting triangles with specific properties: integer side lengths, positive area, and perimeter n.
- n: The perimeter, a positive integer.
- Conditions for triangles: Integer side lengths and positive area, implying non-degenerate triangles satisfying the triangle inequality.
- Inequality: T(n) > 2010, fixed constant threshold.
- Example: Illustration of T(6) = 1 with sides (2,2,2).
- Theme: Combinatorial enumeration of valid triangle configurations based on perimeter, with a focus on finding a threshold n where the count exceeds a given value.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. Modify the triangle type by requiring acute-angled triangles only, which adds a geometric constraint (for each pair of sides, the square of the third side must be less than the sum of their squares).
2. Add a condition that the area must be an integer, introducing a Diophantine constraint that requires Heron's formula to yield an integer, increasing computational complexity.
3. Increase the constant from 2010 to 10000 to account for the reduced count due to stricter conditions, making the threshold harder to reach and requiring larger n.
4. Omit the example to maintain conciseness, as the added conditions make small-n examples trivial (e.g., no such triangles for n=6). The constraints are interconnected, affecting both angle type and area, and are justified by adding real-world mathematical depth (e.g., involving Pythagorean triples, Heronian triangles, and inequalities).

This means that $b \\leq c \\leq m-1$, so $a=2 m-b-c \\geq 2$. Therefore, $a-1, b-1$ and $c-1$ are positive integers since $a, b$ and $c$ are positive integers with $2 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq c$.\n* Since $2 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $1 \\leq a-1 \\leq b-1 \\leq c-1$, so $0<a-1 \\leq b-1 \\leq c-1$.\n* Since $a+b+c=2 m$, then $c=2 m-(a+b)$ so $a+b$ and $c$ have the same parity.\n\nSince $c<a+b$, then $c \\leq a+b-2$.

Note as well that two different triples in $S_{2 m}$ correspond to two different triples in $S_{2 m-3}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{2 m}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{2 m-3}$.\n\nThus, $T(2 m) \\leq T(2 m-3)$.\n\nConsider a triple $(A, B, C)$ in $S_{2 m-3}$ and a corresponding triple $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$. We show that $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$ is in $S_{2 m}$ :\n\n* Since $(A, B, C)$ is in $S_{2 m-3}$, then $A, B$ and $C$ are positive integers, so $A+1, B+1$ and $C+1$ are positive integers.\n* Since $0<A \\leq B \\leq C$, then $1<A+1 \\leq B+1 \\leq C+1$, so $0<A+1 \\leq B+1 \\leq C+1$.\n* Since $C<A+B$, then $C+1<(A+1)+(B+1)-1$ so $C+1<(A+1)+(B+1)$.\n* Since $A+B+C=2 m-3$, then $(A+1)+(B+1)+(C+1)=2 m$.\n\nTherefore, $(A+1, B+1, C+1)$ is in $S_{2 m}$.\n\nNote again that two different triples in $S_{2 m-3}$ correspond to two different triples in $S_{2 m}$.

We show that the triple $(a, b+1, c+1)$ is in $S_{k+2}$ :\n\n* Since $a, b$ and $c$ are positive integers, then $a, b+1$ and $c+1$ are positive integers.\n\n\n\n* Since $0<a \\leq b \\leq c$, then $0<a \\leq b+1 \\leq c+1$.\n* Since $c<a+b$, then $c+1<a+(b+1)$.\n\n$*$ Since $a+b+c=k$, then $a+(b+1)+(c+1)=k+2$.\n\nTherefore, $(a, b+1, c+1)$ is in $S_{k+2}$. Note that, using this correspondence, different triples in $S_{k}$ correspond different triples in $S_{k+2}$. Thus, every triple in $S_{k}$ corresponds to a different triple in $S_{k+2}$.

This contradicts the fact that $n=N$ is the smallest such integer.\n\nTherefore, we want to find the smallest odd positive integer $N$ for which $T(N)>2010$.

*   Process: Form equations from given areas and volume, solve for dimensions, calculate surface area.

#Plan#:
1.  **Introduce an Irrational Element:** Modify one of the given face areas to involve an irrational number (square root), increasing algebraic complexity and ensuring dimensional consistency necessitates solving for the irrational part experimentally via the volume constraint.
2.  **Add Another Geometric Property:** Introduce the calculation of the space diagonal as an additional required step. This forces the solver to first determine the dimensions completely using the volume before finding the diagonal and then the surface area, adding dependency.
3.  **Concretize with Constraints & Reasoning:** State that the three given faces are mutually perpendicular, clarifying their relationship. Introduce integer constraints for the values under the radicals ($k$ and $d$) derived during solution, emphasizing step-by-step deduction and verification against the volume. This increases reasoning steps and ties the irrational areas explicitly back to rational dimensions through the volume constraint.

Given $\sqrt{\tan \theta} = \cos \theta$, find all exact values for $\sin \theta$ and $\cos \theta$ that satisfy $\sin^{4} \theta - \sin^{2} \theta + 1 = 0$. Express answers as simplified numbers.","Step 1
**#Elements Identified#**:
*   **Core Relationship:** The equation $\cos \theta = \tan \theta$.
*   **Functional Output:** $\sin \theta$ as the dependent variable.
*   **Domain Constraint (Implicit):** Values must satisfy the domain where $\cos \theta$ and $\tan \theta$ are defined and related.

*   **Theme:** Trigonometric equation solving, relationship manipulation.
*   **Manipulable Elements:** Form of the functional relationship (e.g., add complexity like powers, roots, additional functions), number of dependent variables, additional implicit constraints, solution space requirements.

**#Plan#**:
1.  **Complicate the Core Relationship:** Change from a simple equality ($\cos \theta = \tan \theta$) to a nested functional relationship: $\sqrt{\tan \theta} = \cos \theta$. This introduces radicals and restricts the domain (requiring $\tan \theta \geq 0$ and $\cos \theta \geq 0$) which depends on the solution, adding interdependence and reasoning about signs and ranges.
2.  **Add a Related Constraint:** Introduce a derived quartic equation in terms of $\sin \theta$ ($\sin^{4} \theta - \sin^{2} \theta + 1 = 0$) that the solutions must also satisfy. This requires solving a higher-degree polynomial and verifying solutions against the original domain.
3.  **Increase Output Specificity:** Require finding *both* $\sin \theta$ and $\cos \theta$ as outputs, increasing the solution requirements and linking both fundamental functions.
4.  **Maintain Exactness:** Solutions must still be exact and simplified.
5.  **Ensure Coherence:** The constraint in step 2 will naturally arise during solving ($\sin^4 \theta - \sin^2 \theta + 1 = 0$ is implicit when solving $\sqrt{\tan \theta} = \cos \theta$ for $\sin \theta$), ensuring logical connection.

**#Elements Identified#:**  
- **Participants**: Linh (car driver) and multiple trains.  
- **Actions**: Driving, being passed by trains at specific intervals, trains departing at fixed intervals.  
- **Variables**:  
  - Linh?s speed: 60 km/h (fixed).  
  - Time between Linh being passed by trains: 10 minutes.  
  - Train departure interval: 3 minutes.  
  - Train speed: unknown constant (\(v\) km/h).  
- **Conditions**:  
  - Straight highway and train track, parallel and same direction.  
  - All trains identical (same speed and length).  
- **Theme**: Relative motion involving constant speeds, time intervals, and spatial relationships.  
- **Expandable components**:  
  - Explicit inclusion of train length.  
  - Definition of ""being passed"" to involve duration (not instant).  
  - Interdependence of variables (e.g., train length, speed, and time intervals influence each other).  

---

Step 2  
**#Plan#:**  
1. **Introduce explicit train length** (concretizing): State that trains have a fixed length \(L\) km (shared identically), making \(L\) a new unknown to solve alongside speed.  
2. **Redefine the ""passing"" event** (adding constraint): Change ""passed by a train"" from an instantaneous event to a process with duration?specify that being passed means the time interval from when the front of the train reaches Linh until the rear leaves her.  
3. **Add a new time metric** (increasing reasoning): Introduce a fixed duration \(T = 2\) minutes for each train to completely pass Linh, creating an additional equation (\(L\) and \(v\) related). This also redefines the 10-minute interval as the time between *starts* of consecutive passing events.  
4. **Link departures, passings, and lengths** (dependencies): Equations must now relate:  
   - Departure interval (3 min) and train speed to distance between consecutive trains.  
   - Relative speed (\(v - 60\)) to the time between passing starts (10 min) *and* the passing duration (2 min) via the train length \(L\).  
   - The gap between trains (factoring \(L\)) becomes critical.  
5. **Ensure solvability**: Two unknowns (\(v\) and \(L\)), with two equations:  
   - One from the headway (10 min between passes) incorporating the gap time (8 min = 10 - 2) and train length.  
   - One from the passing duration (2 min) defining \(L\) relative to (\(v - 60\)).  
   Solve for \(v\) first, then \(L\).

- Ensure all modifications are interconnected: The enlarged set necessitates a longer sum, the non-standard sign pattern affects symmetry and requires detailed case analysis for positions modulo 3, and the oddness constraint on endpoints reduces the symmetric group and links to parity properties.

1.  **Parameterize fixed quantities:** Replace the fixed numbers (5 skaters total, 2 Canadians, 3 medals) with variables (e.g., N total finalists, K Canadians, M medals awarded) to create a generalizable problem template.
2.  **Introduce performance dependence:** Add real-world depth. Specify that prior qualification requires finishing above a certain position (P) in an initial heat, and the K Canadians, with distinct known past medal-relapse probabilities (R1, R2), must both qualify and then medal simultaneously in the final.
3.  **Increase reasoning depth:** Instead of simple non-medaling, require calculating the joint probability that both Canadians fail to medal *and* at least one fails due to relapse, *given* they qualified.
4.  **Interconnect Components:** Link the initial qualification (position <= P) for the Canadian skaters to their subsequent medal-relapse chance in the final. The variation in relapse probabilities adds heterogeneity.

To qualify for the final, a skater must finish within position P in their heat. The final awards M medals. The K Canadians have distinct known probabilities (R?, R?, ..., R?) of relapsing before the final, which prevents medaling. Given all finishing orders are equally likely in both stages and relapse is independent per skater, what is the probability that neither Canadian wins a medal in the final and at least one fails due to relapse, given they qualified?

2. Add a cardinality constraint: Require all sets to have equal size, forcing \(n\) to be divisible by 4 and linking set sizes explicitly to \(n\).
3. Modify the multiples constraint: Instead of fixed multiples of 3, require \(C\) to contain all multiples of a variable \(k\), where \(k = \gcd(6, n)\); this depends on \(n\) and introduces case analysis.
4. Introduce a new constraint for \(D\): \(D\) must contain all numbers congruent to 1 modulo 3, creating residue-based dependencies and interplay with the multiples constraint.
Justification: The four sets (\(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\)) are interdependent via sums, sizes, and residues; \(k\) varies with \(n\), increasing case-sensitive reasoning; cardinality and residue constraints reduce flexibility, adding combinatorial rigor. Elements are logically connected: \(k\) affects \(C\) and the residue system, while equal sizes and sums depend on \(n\)'s factors.

Find all even savage integers less than 100.",success,140.04,"[""First, we prove lemma (b): if $n$ is an even savage integer, then $\\frac{n+4}{12}$ is an integer.\n\nProof of lemma (b):\nWe use the strategy of putting all of the multiples of 3 between 1 and $n$ in the set $C$, all of the remaining even numbers in the set $B$, and all of the remaining numbers in the set $A$. The sums of these sets will not likely all be equal, but we then try to adjust the sums to by moving elements out of $A$ and $B$ into $C$ to try to make these sums equal. (Notice that we can't move elements either into $A$ or $B$, or out of $C$.) We will use the notation $|C|$ to denote the sum of the elements of $C$.\n\nSince we are considering the case of $n$ even and we want to examine multiples of 3 less than or equal to $n$, it makes sense to consider $n$ as having one of the three forms $6 k$, $6 k+2$ or $6 k+4$. (These forms allow us to quickly tell what the greatest multiple of 3 less than $n$ is.)\n\nCase 1: $n=6 k$\n\nIn this case, $C$ contains at least the integers $3,6,9, \\ldots, 6 k$, and so the sum of $C$ is greater than one-third of the sum of the integers from 1 to $n$, since if we divide the integers from 1 to $n=6 k$ into groups of 3 consecutive integers starting with 1,2, 3 , then the set $C$ will always contain the largest of the 3 .\n\n\n\nCase 2: $n=6 k+4$\n\nHere, the sum of the integers from 1 to $n=6 k+4$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(6 k+4)(6 k+5)=18 k^{2}+27 k+10=3\\left(6 k^{2}+9 k+3\\right)+1$, which is never divisible by 3 . Therefore, $n$ cannot be savage in this case because the integers from 1 to $n$ cannot be partitioned into 3 sets with equal sums.\n\nCase 3: $n=6 k+2$\n\nHere, the sum of the integers from 1 to $n=6 k+2$ is\n\n$\\frac{1}{2}(6 k+2)(6 k+3)=18 k^{2}+15 k+3$, so the sum of the elements of each of the sets $A, B$ and $C$ should be $6 k^{2}+5 k+1$, so that the sums are equal.\n\nIn this case $C$, contains at least the integers $3,6,9, \\ldots, 6 k$, and so $|C| \\geq 3+6+9+\\cdots 6 k=3(1+2+3+\\cdots+2 k)=3\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(2 k)(2 k+1)\\right)=6 k^{2}+3 k$\n\nThe set $A$ contains at most the integers $1,3,5,7, \\ldots, 6 k+1$, but does not contain the odd multiples of 3 less than $n$, ie. the integers $3,9,15, \\ldots, 6 k-3$. Therefore, $|A| \\leq(1+3+5+\\cdots+6 k+1)-(3+9+\\cdots+6 k-3)$\n\n$=\\frac{1}{2}(3 k+1)[1+6 k+1]-\\frac{1}{2}(k)[3+6 k-3]$\n\n$=(3 k+1)(3 k+1)-k(3 k)$\n\n$=6 k^{2}+6 k+1$\n\n(To compute the sum of each of these arithmetic sequences, we use the fact that the sum of an arithmetic sequence is equal to half of the number of terms times the sum of the first and last terms.)\n\nThe set $B$ contains at most the integers $2,4,6,8, \\ldots, 6 k+2$, but does not contain the even multiples of 3 less than $n$, ie. the integers $6,12, \\ldots, 6 k$. Therefore, $|B| \\leq(2+4+6+\\cdots+6 k+2)-(6+12+\\cdots+6 k)$\n\n$=\\frac{1}{2}(3 k+1)[2+6 k+2]-\\frac{1}{2}(k)[6+6 k]$\n\n$=(3 k+1)(3 k+2)-k(3 k+3)$\n\n$=6 k^{2}+6 k+2$\n\nThus, the set $C$ is $2 k+1$ short of the desired sum, while the set $A$ has a sum that is $k$ too big and the set $B$ has a sum that is $k+1$ too big.\n\nSo in order to correct this, we would like to move elements from $A$ adding to $k$, and elements from $B$ which add to $k+1$ all to set $C$.\n\n\n\nSince we are assuming that $n$ is savage, then this is possible, which means that $k+1$ must be even since every element in $B$ is even, so the sum of any number of elements of $B$ is even.\n\nTherefore, $k$ is odd, and so $k=2 l+1$ for some integer $l$, and so\n\n$n=6(2 l+1)+2=12 l+8$, ie. $\\frac{n+4}{12}$ is an integer.\n\nHaving examined all cases, we see that if $n$ is an even savage integer, then $\\frac{n+4}{12}$ is an integer.\n\n\nFrom the proof of (b) above, the only possible even savage integers less than 100 are those satisfying the condition that $\\frac{n+4}{12}$ is an integer, ie. $8,20,32,44,56,68,80,92$. We already know that 8 is savage, so we examine the remaining 7 possibilities.\n\nWe make a table of the possibilities, using the notation from the proof of (b):\n\n| $n$ | $k$ | Sum of elements <br> to remove from $A$ | Sum of elements <br> to remove from $B$ | Possible? |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 20 | 3 | 3 | 4 | No - cannot remove a sum of 3 from <br> A. |\n| 32 | 5 | 5 | 6 | Yes - remove 5 from $A, 2$ and 4 <br> from $B$ |\n| 44 | 7 | 7 | 8 | Yes - remove 7 from $A, 8$ from $B$ |\n| 56 | 9 | 9 | 10 | No - cannot remove a sum of 9 from <br> A. |\n| 68 | 11 | 11 | 12 | Yes - remove 11 from $A, 4$ and 8 <br> from $B$ |\n| 80 | 13 | 13 | 14 | Yes - remove 13 from $A, 14$ from $B$ |\n| 92 | 15 | 15 | 16 | No - cannot remove a sum of 15 <br> from $A$ (since could only use $1,5,7$, <br> 11,13 ) |\n\nTherefore, the only even savage integers less than 100 are 8, 32, 44, 68 and 80.""]",OE_TO,,,

*   **Core Concept:** Solving a logarithmic equation by combining terms and solving the resulting algebraic equation.
*   **Equation Type:** Single equation with a sum of two logarithms of linear expressions set equal to a constant (1).
*   **Variables:** The unknown variable `x`.
*   **Properties Used:** Logarithm property `log_b(a) + log_b(c) = log_b(a*c)`.
*   **Constraints:** Implied domain restrictions (`x+3 > 0` and `x-1 > 0`, i.e., `x > 1`).
*   **Solution Process:** 1) Apply log property. 2) Use `log_b(a) = c => a = b^c`. 3) Solve resulting quadratic. 4) Verify within domain.
*   **Theme:** Logarithmic equations requiring algebraic solution and domain verification.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Change the Constant:** Replace the constant `1` with a **variable expression** `log_5(3x - 2)`, moving the right-hand side beyond a simple constant. This forces application of `log_b(A) = log_b(B) => A = B` as the next step.
2.  **Introduce an Additional Term:** **Add a third logarithmic term** to the left-hand side: `log_5(2x - k)`, where `k` is a small positive constant (e.g., `k = 1`). This increases the complexity of combining logs and the resulting algebraic equation. To be meaningful, `k` must be >0 to create a valid argument and `2x - k` must be defined within the domain (reinforcing constraints).
3.  **Adjust Domain Constraint:** To accommodate the new term `log_5(2x - k)` and resolve potential ambiguity with the `x > 1` constraint versus the constant `k`, require an **explicit domain constraint** `x > 4`. This concretizes the domain check step.
4.  **Justification:** The new expression `log_5(x+3) + log_5(x-1) + log_5(2x - k) = log_5(3x - 2)` requires the student to (a) apply the sum-to-product property twice, (b) correctly handle equating logs of arguments, leading to the equation `(x+3)(x-1)(2x-k) = (3x-2)`, (c) solve the resulting cubic equation, (d) verify all solutions satisfy `x > 4` to ensure arguments are positive. The complexity increases through the added term, the variable expression on the RHS, modifying the algebraic equation from quadratic to cubic, and making the domain constraint explicit and stricter.

1.  **Introduce Data Inconsistency/Overdetermination:** Add a third goose mass/cooking time data point at `180?C`. This makes an exact solution impossible, requiring an optimization method (least squares) to find `a` and `b` that best fit *all* the data.
2.  **Introduce Variable Parameter Dependence:** Make the constants `a` and `b` dependent on the oven temperature `T` (?C). Define this dependence linearly: `a = c1 + c2*T`, `b = d1 + d2*T`. This introduces four new parameters (`c1, c2, d1, d2`).
3.  **Provide Additional Data for New Variables:** Include data for different oven temperatures (`200?C`, `160?C`) along with corresponding cooking times for *two* goose masses at each temperature. This provides enough equations to solve for the new parameters and requires fitting across temperatures and masses.
4.  **Concretize Process:** Specify the method (`nonlinear least squares regression`) for fitting the combined model `t = (c1 + c2*T) * m^(d1 + d2*T)` to the entire dataset to find `c1, c2, d1, d2`. This complexity arises from needing to handle the interaction between `m` and `T` within the exponent.

Given that after 6 games they are tied at 3 wins each, what is the probability that after 10 games Blaise will have won more games than Pierre?","**Step 1**  
**#Elements Identified#:**  
- Participants: Blaise and Pierre.  
- Number of games: Fixed at 6 in the original instruction.  
- Core condition: Each player is equally likely to win any game (P=0.5 per game), and games are independent.  
- Given probability: Exact tie after 6 games (3-3) is \(\frac{5}{16}\).  
- Question: Probability Blaise wins more games than Pierre after 6 games.  
- Key modifiable elements: Total number of games, dependency between games or outcomes, introduction of conditional events (e.g., partial progress), skill level variability, additional constraints or stages.  
- Theme: Binomial probability in a fair, discrete game series.  

**Step 2**  
**#Plan#:**  
1. **Increase the number of games:** Extend from 6 to 10 games to introduce additional stages and conditioning.  
2. **Add condition on intermediate state:** Use the given probability for a 6-game subsequence as a known quantity, and condition from there for the full series.  
3. **Introduce conditional probability:** Frame the problem to require calculation of a conditional probability based on an intermediate tied state (after 6 games) to determine the final outcome.  
4. **Enhance complexity:** This modification demands:  
   - Handling a larger total game count (10 games)  
   - Using intermediate result (tie at 6 games) for conditioning  
   - Maintaining the binomial structure while adding post-conditioning computation  
   - Ensuring logical coherence; the given \(\frac{5}{16}\) justifies the initial tie probability, and independence after conditioning preserves solvability.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Introduce fractional coefficients:** Add fractional coefficients (e.g., \(1/3\), \(1/2\)) to specific terms. This complicates simplification and makes immediate reduction by factoring a common factor less obvious. Modify: Add \(1/3\) to the coefficient of \(2^{x+2}\) and either introduce or change another term to include a fractional coefficient involving a different base.
2.  **Introduce rational expression:** Add a term that depends on the solution interval, such as a rational expression in \(x\) (e.g., \(1/(x-k)\) for some constant \(k\)). This introduces undefined points and forces case splitting. Modify: Introduce a term like \(1/(x-3)\) on the LHS and adjust other terms to compensate.
3.  **Constrain solution domain:** Add a specified interval for consideration (e.g., \(1 \leq x \leq 4\)). The solution must still be valid within this domain, and the rational expression will impose additional constraints. Modify: Add the interval constraint \(1 \leq x \leq 4\).
4.  **Ensure logical coherence:** The introduced fractional coefficient, rational term, and domain constraint will create a problem requiring careful algebraic manipulation, understanding of rational function behavior, case splitting due to discontinuity, and solution verification within a bounded interval. Existing terms must be adjusted to ensure the equation remains solvable and non-trivial.

**#Elements Identified#**:  
- Variables: $a$ and $b$ are randomly selected from discrete finite sets $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ and $\{6,7,8\}$.
- Condition: Check if $a^b$ is even, which depends solely on the parity of $a$.  
- Participants: None beyond the variables, with no dependencies or constraints.  
- Actions/Processes: Direct variable selection and exponentiation.  
- Theme: Probability involving exponent parity with independent finite sets.  

Key components to enhance:  
- Expand variable selection to involve dependencies or layers.  
- Introduce constraints that interact with the probability condition.  
- Increase reasoning complexity by using derived sets or inequalities.  
- Maintain the theme of exponent parity evaluation for coherence.  

**Step 2**  
**#Plan#**:  
1. **Introduce a new variable and selection**: Add a random variable $k$ chosen from $\{2,3,4,5\}$, making $a$ and $b$ dependent on it. This adds a layer of initial randomization and set derivation.  
2. **Derive $a$ and $b$ sets dynamically**: $a$ becomes a divisor of $k$ (with constraints to keep values bounded: divisors ? 5), and $b$ is selected from a set derived from $\{k+4, k+5, k+6\}$, ensuring variable set sizes and relevance to $k$.  
3. **Add an inequality constraint**: Include a condition $2a < b$ to filter the eligible pairs, creating interdependency and reducing the sample space conditionally.  
4. **Maintain core theme**: Evaluate $a^b$ for evenness as the final condition, preserving the focus on exponentiation parity while increasing reasoning steps around dynamics and constraints.

6.  **Variables:** Single independent variable $x$, single parameter $k$.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Increase Term Complexity:** Introduce a lower-order trigonometric term to the expression with its own coefficient ($k_2 \sin^2x \cos^2x$).
2.  **Add Parameters:** Replace single parameter $k$ with two distinct parameters ($k_1$ & $k_2$), creating a system.
3.  **Add Constraint & Parameterization:** Require expressing $k_2$ as a rational function of $k_1$ ($k_2 = k_1/m$ with $m \neq 1$). This replaces solving for single values with finding a parameterized relation.
4.  **Introduce Domain Restriction:** Add an explicit domain restriction ($x \neq \pi/4 + n\pi/2$) due to singularities potentially arising in constraint application. This forces consideration of domain impact on ""for all $x$"" constancy.
5.  **Add Conditions for Constants:** Specify that distinct constants from simplified expressions must equal conditions derived for constancy ($\lambda_1(k_1 + 3k_2)=0$, $\lambda_2(k_1 - k_2)=0$), introducing auxiliary constants $\lambda_i$.
6.  **Connect Elements Logically:** Link the new conditions ($\lambda_1, \lambda_2$) to the parameterized expression ($k_1, k_2=k_1/m$), requiring solving for $m$ given the conditions on $k_1$ and $k_2$.

#Elements Identified#:  
- The function \(f(x) = \sin^6 x + \cos^6 x + k (\sin^4 x + \cos^4 x)\) involves a parameter \(k\) and trigonometric transformations.  
- The original problem sets \(k = -0.7\) and requires solving \(f(x) = 0\).  
- The equation solving process leverages trigonometric identities to simplify and find solutions.  
- Key elements for complexity manipulation: the value of \(k\), the structure of \(f(x)\), and the solving condition \(f(x) = 0\).  
- Theme: Trigonometric equation solving with a parameter, involving simplification, roots, and parameter determination.  

**Step 2**  
#Plan#:  
1. **Change \(k\) from given to unknown:** Require finding \(k\) using a condition (double root at a specific point) to add calculus and parametrization complexity.  
2. **Modify the solving condition:** Introduce a double root requirement (both \(f(x) = 0\) and \(f'(x) = 0\)) at a chosen point \(x_0 = \pi/4\), ensuring the derivative condition is inherently satisfied at this point, while \(f(\pi/4) = 0\) determines \(k\). This adds differential calculus and multi-layer root analysis.  
3. **Specify solution interval and multiplicity handling:** Require all solutions in \([0, 2\pi)\), including multiplicity verification, to deepen algebraic and trigonometric reasoning.

Rationale for the solution of the rewritten problem:
We know that:
   P(81<=x<=99) = log_{100}(100/81)
   P(n<=x<=2n) = log_{100}((2n+1)/n)

 Then the condition:
   log_{100}(100/81) = (n/9) * log_{100}((2n+1)/n)

 Exponential form with base 100:

    100/81 = [ (2n+1)/n ]^(n/9)

 Take both to the wie? 9th power:

    (100/81)^9 = [ (2n+1)/n ]^n

#Elements Identified#:  
- Probability distribution: \( \log_{100}\left(1 + \frac{1}{x}\right) \) for integer \( x \) in \([1, 99]\)  
- Primary event: Probability that \( 81 \leq x \leq 99 \)  
- Secondary event: Probability that \( x = n \) (singleton event)  
- Relationship: Probability of primary event equals 2 times probability of secondary event  
- Unknown: Value of \( n \)  
- Core concept: Logarithmic probability distribution with discrete intervals and algebraic solving  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
To increase complexity:  
1. Change the secondary event: Replace the singleton event \(\{x=n\}\) with a compound event \(\{x \in [n, n+k]\}\) (variable interval instead of point).  
2. Replace the constant factor (2) with a variable factor that depends on \(n\).  
3. Replace fixed interval boundaries with parameters that depend on the unknown \(n\) for one of the events.  
4. Maintain all variables interconnected through constraints: The intervals must be valid (within \([1,99]\)) and the factor must nontrivially depend on the structure.  
Specifically:  
- Define secondary event as the interval \([n^2, (n+1)^2]\) to introduce quadratic growth.  
- Relationship: Probability of \([81,99]\) equals \( \sqrt{n} \) times the probability of \([n^2, (n+1)^2]\).  
- Validate: \( 81 \leq n^2 \leq (n+1)^2 \leq 99 \) constrains \(n\).  

Step 3  
#Rewritten Instruction#:  
A computer chooses an integer between 1 and 99 with probability \( P(x) = \log_{100}\left(1 + \frac{1}{x}\right) \). The probability that \( 81 \leq x \leq 99 \) equals \( \sqrt{n} \) times the probability that \( n^2 \leq x \leq (n+1)^2 \) for some integer \( n \). Find \( n \).  

Step 4  
#Finally Rewritten Instruction#:  
A computer selects an integer \(x\) from 1 to 99 with probability \(P(x) = \log_{100}\left(1 + \frac{1}{x}\right)\). Given that the probability \(81 \leq x \leq 99\) is \(\sqrt{n}\) times the probability that \(n^2 \leq x \leq (n+1)^2\) for some integer \(n\), determine \(n\).","We are given an instruction to rewrite to make it more complex. After careful thought, we decide to modify the condition by changing the singleton event to an interval event of variable length. Specifically, we will change ""the probability that x=n"" to ""the probability that n ? x ? n+k"", where k is a fixed integer, and n must be chosen such that the interval is within [1,99]. However, to ensure a solution and increase complexity, we use k=10. But note from our trial we had issues with boundaries. To ensure the interval is within bounds, we'll specify that n is such that n+10 ? 99, and also to avoid triviality n?1.

But from our trial calculations, we had:

  P(81?x?99) = log_{100}(100/81)
  P(n?x?n+10) = log_{100}((n+11)/n)

Setting them equal with a factor of 2 didn't work, so we change the factor to 3? Let me check:

  Condition: P(81?x?99) = 3 * P(n?x?n+10)

Then:

  log_{100}(100/81) = 3 * log_{100}((n+11)/n)

  => log_{100}(100/81) = log_{100}( ((n+11)/n)^3 )

  => 100/81 = ((n+11)/n)^3

  => (n+11)/n = (100/81)^{(1/3)}

  => 1 + 11/n = (100/81)^{(1/3)}

  => 11/n = (100/81)^{(1/3)} - 1

  => n = 11 / ( (100/81)^{(1/3)} - 1 )

We compute (100/81) = approximately 1.2345679, its cube root is approximately 1.0727, then

  n ? 11 / (1.0727 - 1) = 11 / 0.0727 ? 151.3

This is outside [1,89] and not an integer.

Alternatively, let us try with factor 1:

  P(81?x?99) = P(n?x?n+10)

  => log_{100}(100/81) = log_{100}((n+11)/n)

  => 100/81 = (n+11)/n

  => 100n = 81n + 891

  => 19n = 891

  => n = 891/19 ? 46.89, not integer.

With factor 4:

  log_{100}(100/81) = 4 * log_{100}( (n+11)/n )
  => 100/81 = ( (n+11)/n )^4
  => (n+11)^4 / n^4 = 100/81
  => (n+11)/n = (100/81)^{1/4}
  => 1+11/n = (100/81)^{0.25}
  (100/81)^{0.25} = sqrt( sqrt(100/81) ) = sqrt(10/9) = approximately sqrt(1.111)?1.054 
  11/n = 0.054 => n?203.7 -> not in [1,89] and not integer.

Given the above, I revert to the original and change to an instruction that is complex and has a solution, by perhaps using [n,2n] and a different factor. Recall:

  P(81..99) = 2 * P(n<=x<=2n)

Step 1
#Elements Identified#:
- Probability distribution: P(x) = log_{100}(1+1/x)
- Range of integer: 1 to 99
- Event A: 81 ? x ? 99
- Event condition: Prob(Event A) = 2 * Prob(x=n) (singleton event)
- Unknown: n

Step 2
#Plan#:
Change the event of the singleton to an interval event with variable boundaries. Specifically, instead of a single point x=n, use an interval [n, 2n]. This requires:
1. Ensure the interval [n,2n] is within [1,99] -> implying n>=1 and 2n<=99 -> n in [1,49].
2. The probability of an interval is more complex to sum than a singleton.
Additionally, change the factor from 2 to being n/9 (because in the original solution n=9) to ensure there is a solution.
 Thus the condition becomes: P(81?x?99) = (n/9) * P(n?x?2n)
The plan increases complexity by using a variable interval and a factor that depends on n, requiring more advanced algebraic manipulation and solving.

Step 3
#Rewritten Instruction#:
A computer is programmed to choose an integer between 1 and 99, inclusive, so that the probability that it selects x is log_{100}(1+1/x). Suppose the probability that 81 ? x ? 99 is equal to (n/9) times the probability that n ? x ? 2n for some integer n. What is n?

Step 4
#Finally Rewritten Instruction#:
A computer is programmed to choose an integer between 1 and 99, inclusive, according to the probability distribution \( P(x) = \log_{100}\left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right) \). Given that the probability that \( 81 \leq x \leq 99 \) equals \( \frac{n}{9} \) times the probability that \( n \leq x \leq 2n \) for some integer n, find n.
===============================================================================

Rationale for the solution of the rewritten problem:
We know that:
   P(81<=x<=99) = log_{100}(100/81)
   P(n<=x<=2n) = log_{100}((2n+1)/n)

 Then the condition:
   log_{100}(100/81) = (n/9) * log_{100}((2n+1)/n)

 Exponential form with base 100:

    100/81 = [ (2n+1)/n ]^(n/9)

 Take both to the wie? 9th power:

    (100/81)^9 = [ (2n+1)/n ]^n

 But note that (2n+1)/n = 2 + 1/n, so:

    (100/81)^9 = (2 + 1/n)^n

Step 1  
#Elements Identified#:  
- Probability distribution: \( \log_{100}\left(1 + \frac{1}{x}\right) \) for integer \( x \) in \([1, 99]\)  
- Primary event: Probability that \( 81 \leq x \leq 99 \)  
- Secondary event: Probability that \( x = n \) (singleton event)  
- Relationship: Probability of primary event equals 2 times probability of secondary event  
- Unknown: Value of \( n \)  
- Core concept: Logarithmic probability distribution with discrete intervals and algebraic solving  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
To increase complexity:  
1. Change the secondary event: Replace the singleton event \(\{x=n\}\) with a compound event \(\{x \in [n, n+k]\}\) (variable interval instead of point).  
2. Replace the constant factor (2) with a variable factor that depends on \(n\).  
3. Replace fixed interval boundaries with parameters that depend on the unknown \(n\) for one of the events.  
4. Maintain all variables interconnected through constraints: The intervals must be valid (within \([1,99]\)) and the factor must nontrivially depend on the structure.  
Specifically:  
- Define secondary event as the interval \([n^2, (n+1)^2]\) to introduce quadratic growth.  
- Relationship: Probability of \([81,99]\) equals \( \sqrt{n} \) times the probability of \([n^2, (n+1)^2]\).  
- Validate: \( 81 \leq n^2 \leq (n+1)^2 \leq 99 \) constrains \(n\).  

Step 3  
#Rewritten Instruction#:  
A computer chooses an integer between 1 and 99 with probability \( P(x) = \log_{100}\left(1 + \frac{1}{x}\right) \). The probability that \( 81 \leq x \leq 99 \) equals \( \sqrt{n} \) times the probability that \( n^2 \leq x \leq (n+1)^2 \) for some integer \( n \). Find \( n \).

#Elements Identified#:
- **Variables**: $x$ and $y$, both positive integers.
- **Conditions**: The equation $\frac{1}{32} = \frac{x}{10^{y}}$ must hold exactly for some positive integer $y$, and $x$ must be the smallest such integer.
- **Actions/Processes**: Solve for the minimum $x$ by finding a $y$ that satisfies the equation, involving divisibility and powers of 10.
- **Theme**: Number theory problem focusing on solving a Diophantine equation with exponential constraints, specifically identifying when a fraction equals a decimal expansion (power of 10).

Step 2
#Plan#:
- **Modify the base**: Change the fixed base of 10 to a variable integer base $b > 1$ to introduce variability and dependency.
- **Add constraints on the base**: Specify that $b$ must not be a power of 2 to exclude trivial solutions and necessitate a more complex search for $b$ and $y$.
- **Expand the solution space**: Require finding $x$ for some $b$ and $y$ (introducing multiple variables), which increases complexity by forcing consideration of multiple cases and optimizations.
- **Ensure logical coherence**: The new elements are interconnected?the base $b$ affects the minimal $x$, and the constraint on $b$ ensures a non-trivial solution involves balancing factors from 32 while preventing powers of 2 from simplifying too easily.

**#Plan#**:  
- **Change sequence type**: Replace the arithmetic sequence condition with a **geometric sequence** condition. This introduces non-linear equations (quadratic) for the common ratio, increasing algebraic complexity.  
- **Increase case complexity**: The geometric sequence requires considering additional cases for the hypotenuse?s position (since the hypotenuse must be the largest side, but the geometric progression order depends on the ratio).  
- **Expand variable constraints**: The fixed side (60) can correspond to any of the three sequence terms, and its role (leg or hypotenuse) must be analyzed case-wise, leading to multiple expressions for the area.

- Output: Determine $\sin 2x$ and express in the form $\frac{a\pi^{2} + b\pi + c}{d}$ with integer $a,b,c,d$.  
- Key operations: Solving the equation involves manipulating trigonometric identities and simplifying to the specified algebraic form.  

Factors for complexity increase:  
- Modifiable elements: Coefficients inside the trig functions, addition of phase shifts, output function (e.g., multiple outputs or different expressions), domain constraints, and dependencies (e.g., adding parameters or interlinked variables).  
- Theme: Solving a transcendental trigonometric equation with precise algebraic output; should remain consistent.

1. Change the argument coefficients to different integers: Replace $\frac{3}{2}$ with $2$ for cos and $3$ for sin, creating asymmetry: $\cos(2 \cos x) = \sin(3 \sin x)$.  
2. Add a constant phase shift to the cos argument: Incorporate $\frac{\pi}{4}$ to increase manipulation complexity: $\cos(2 \cos x + \frac{\pi}{4}) = \sin(3 \sin x)$.  
3. Expand the output requirement to include both $\sin 2x$ and $\cos 2x$, expressed in the same form, ensuring logical connection through double-angle identities and increased computation.  

Justification:  
- Asymmetric coefficients and phase shift disrupt symmetry, requiring more involved identity applications.  
- Dual output ($\sin 2x$ and $\cos 2x$) extends problem scope while maintaining thematic coherence through trigonometric relationships.

1.  **Modify Base Multiples:** Change the multipliers for the consecutive sequences to less common integers (e.g., 5 and 7 instead of 3 and 4).
2.  **Complicate Average Relationship:** Replace the simple offset (`a + 27`) with a more complex algebraic relation involving `a` and another defined variable `k` (e.g., `2a - k`).
3.  **Add Constraint:** Introduce the requirement that one specific integer among the seven (chosen so it requires solving) is a perfect square. Specify which one (e.g., the smallest integer in the combined set).
4.  **Link Sequences & Define k:** Instead of independent sequences, state that one sequence starts where the other ends. Use this link point to naturally define the variable `k` (e.g., `k` is the difference between the smallest and largest integer in the first set).
5.  **Concretize Reasoning:** Remove the fixed ""42"" average by replacing it with an expression (`a + 17`) depending on `a`. Ensure components interconnect: the multipliers affect the sequences, the sequences define the averages and `k`, `k` defines the second average, and perfect square condition links back to solving for `a`.

#Elements Identified#:
*   **Original Equation**: \(2^{x+2} 5^{6-x} = 10^{x^{2}}\).
*   **Solve For**: Finding the two real values of the variable \(x\) satisfying the equation.
*   **Core Solving Approach**: Taking logarithms or manipulating exponents to reduce the equation to a solvable algebraic form, likely by exploiting the relationship \(10 = 2 \times 5\).
*   **Theme**: Solving an exponential equation with different bases related through factors of 10, resulting in a quadratic equation.
*   **Manipulation Points**: Function complexity (exponent complexity), variable interaction (dependency on \(x\)), solution constraints (number, domain), form of the expression (linear vs. higher order exponents).
*   **Key Condition**: Stated existence of exactly two real solutions.

*   **Initial Angle Simplification:** Linear progression in angle (`10k?`)

*   **Fixed Multiplicity:** Multiplicity of sine in denominator is fixed (`2`)

*   **Action:** Counting the number of solutions satisfying the inequality (`? 2`)
*   **Theme:** Solving a rational trigonometric inequality over a discrete domain.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Make Angle Non-Linear:** Change the angle argument to a quadratic expression in `k` (`(a*k2 + b*k)?` where `a`, `b` are integers) instead of `10k?` to complicate angle values and periodicity considerations. This increases difficulty by introducing non-monotonic angles and requiring consideration of trigonometric function behavior over a quadratic path.
2.  **Change Denominator's Multiplicity:** Replace `sin2(?)` in the denominator with `sin(m?)` where `m` is a linear function of `k` (`m = c*k + d`, `c`, `d` integers). This dramatically complicates the functional expression and its analysis, breaking the potential simplifications possible with `sin2(?)`.
3.  **Expand Domain and Add Parity Constraint:** Extend the domain to include negative integers (`k` from `-N` to `N`) and add a constraint that only even integers `k` are considered. This widens the solution space while adding a filtering step.
4.  **Require Solution Identification Beyond Counting:** Change the output requirement from ""counting"" solutions to ""determining the ordered pairs `(k1, k2)`"" satisfying the inequality and any constraints. This forces consideration of relationships between solutions rather than just existence.
5.  **Ensure Connectivity:** The modified structural complexity (Points 1 & 2) necessitates the extended domain (Point 3) to capture sufficient variation. The pairing requirement (Point 4) gains relevance due to the quadratic angle making symmetry or asymmetry non-obvious. The nonsensical denominator `sin((k2 - k)?)` chosen in step 3 prevents oversimplification.

#Elements Identified#:
- The array structure: two rows, infinite extent, indices for all integers \(k\), entries \(A_k\) (top) and \(B_k\) (bottom) with vertical alignment.
- Averaging conditions: For every \(k\), \(A_k\) is the average of the entry to its left (\(A_{k-1}\)), right (\(A_{k+1}\)), and below (\(B_k\)); \(B_k\) is the average of the entry to its left (\(B_{k-1}\)), right (\(B_{k+1}\)), and above (\(A_k\)).
- Given conditions: \(A_0 = A_1 = A_2 = 0\), \(A_3 = 1\).
- Objective: Find \(A_4\).
- Theme: Linear relationships and symmetries in an infinite array solvable via systems of equations.
- Elements to increase complexity: Number of rows, averaging formula (e.g., additional terms, weights), given conditions (e.g., specific values for additional points or rows), dependencies between variables, and constraints to reduce symmetry.

Step 2
#Plan#:
- Increase the number of rows from two to three (add a bottom row \(C_k\)) to introduce more interacting variables and equations.
- Modify the averaging formulas for all rows to include diagonal or adjacent cell dependencies, specifically:
  - For \(A_k\): Average left, right, below (\(B_k\)), and diagonally below-right (\(B_{k+1}\)).
  - For \(B_k\): Average left, right, above (\(A_k\)), below (\(C_k\)), and diagonally above-left (\(A_{k-1}\)).
  - For \(C_k\): Average left, right, above (\(B_k\)), and diagonally below-left (\(C_{k-1}\)).
  To maintain logical consistency, each average must have a sum of coefficients normalized to 1 (e.g., all terms equally weighted).
- Add concrete given conditions to resolve system determinism: Retain \(A_0 = A_1 = A_2 = 0\) and \(A_3 = 1\), introduce \(B_0 = 0\), and specify a new condition \(C_1 = -1\) to break symmetries and increase dependencies.
- Increase reasoning effort by requiring determination of a less central variable (e.g., find \(B_4\) instead of \(A_4\)) and ensuring the system remains solvable only through interconnected linear relations.

1.  **Modify Function Bases:** Replace the common logarithm (`log??`) in one function with a natural logarithm (`ln`), requiring solvers to use the change-of-base formula within the equation solving process, introducing an additional step and constant.
2.  **Introduce Non-Constant Coefficient:** Replace the constant `1` in the second equation with a non-constant expression, specifically `1 + sin(?x/2)`. This introduces periodicity and significant constraints on the valid solution intervals and makes the equation transcendental for most `x`.
3.  **Add Parametric Constraint:** Instead of finding *all* points of intersection within the real domain within one period, demand finding the coordinates of the intersection point(s) with the *minimum* positive `x`-coordinate **and** express the `y`-coordinate parametrically where `x = 2 + tan2(?)` for `? ?

- Theme: Counting permutations of a finite set subject to specific precedence constraints, with a practical example provided.  
- Action: Compute the total number of acceptable lineups that satisfy all given conditions.

1. Increase the number of participants by adding Carol and Mike to the lineup, expanding from 6 to 8 people, which enlarges the permutation space.  
2. Introduce fixed position constraints: Carol must be in the first position, and Mike must be in the last position, reducing available slots and restricting freedom.

The instruction involves computing the area of a pentagon defined by vertices at specific coordinates: $T=(0,0)$, $N=(2,0)$, $Y=(6,6)$, $W=(2,6)$, $R=(0,2)$. The core concept is to use the shoelace formula or geometric decomposition to find the area. Key elements are the fixed points, the pentagon shape, and the explicit coordinates. Complexity can be increased by adding a point defined by a geometric property (e.g., centroid), expanding the shape to a hexagon, and introducing an intermediate calculation.

1. Expanding the pentagon to a hexagon to increase the number of vertices and necessitate more complex area computation.  
2. Introducing a sixth point $S$ defined as the centroid of triangle $TNY$, adding an intermediate geometric calculation.  
3. Ensuring dependencies by requiring the centroid computation before area determination, creating a logical sequence.

- Constants: \( T = 20\sqrt{7} \) represents a fixed numerical value.  
- Variables: \( w > 0 \) is the real number to be solved for based on the area condition.  
- Region definition: Specifies the area below \( y = \lceil x \rceil^{2} \) and above the \( x\)-axis, bounded left by \( x = 0 \) and right by \( x = w \).

- Theme: Involves definite integration with piecewise-defined functions to solve for a bound, with a ceiling operation for discretization.  

### Step 2  
#Plan#:  
To increment complexity coherently, modify three key elements:  
1. **Change the lower boundary**: Replace ""above the \( x\)-axis"" with ""above the graph of \( y = \lfloor x \rfloor \)"". This forces the region to be between two piecewise constant functions (ceiling squared and floor function), increasing algebraic complexity in the integrand.  
2. **Add an additional function in the area definition**: Introduce a third graph, \( y = \lceil x \rceil \cdot \lfloor x \rfloor \), below which the region lies. This requires handling a more intricate piecewise product function and constraining the area between three boundaries.  
3. **Modify the computation step**: Instead of computing \( \lceil 2w \rceil \) directly, compute \( \lceil w + \sqrt{w} \rceil \). This adds a nonlinear transformation before the ceiling operation, requiring solving for \( w \) and performing an additional calculation.  
The plan ensures logical interconnection: \( T \) defines the area between the new boundaries, solving for \( w \) involves summing more complex piecewise terms, and the computation step incorporates a root function.

In order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \rightarrow\{1,2, \ldots, k\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\left(r_{i}\right)=f\left(r_{j}\right)$ for $i \neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.

For example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.


For a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\operatorname{chef}_{\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\{$ Sally, David $\}$.


If $\operatorname{gr}(T)=\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$ for some $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\operatorname{gr}(T)>\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$ for each dish $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.


A resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \leq i \leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \leq i, j \leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.

- Towns (sets of residents) and dishes (each resident knows two distinct dishes, no identical pairs)
- Full town ?_d (every dish pair covered exactly once by a resident, |dish(?_d)| = d)
- Group assignment and group number gr(T)
- Chef sets chef_T(D) for dish D
- Homogeneous/Heterogeneous classification based on gr(T) vs. |chef_T(D)|
- Resident cycles (cycles in the dish-sharing resident graph, defined by consecutive edge adjacencies only)
- Distinguishable cycles (based on resident membership, not order)
- Specific task: Count distinguishable resident cycles of length 6 in ?_8.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Generalize Cycle Type:** Change ""resident cycle"" to a more complex structural requirement. Replace it with a **Hamiltonian resident cycle** defined as a cycle visiting each resident exactly once (ensuring the cycle has length pop(?_d), increasing combinatorics and linking cycle length explicitly to population).
2.  **Add Constraint - Homomorphism:** Require that the function mapping each resident in the cycle to one of their two dishes must be a **homomorphism to another graph**. Specify homomorphism to the cycle graph C_d to embed dish relationship constraints.
3.  **Add Constraint - Peripheral Cycle:** Impose that the cycle must be **peripheral**, meaning it is not induced and has no chords (i.e., non-consecutive residents in the cycle cannot share a dish), significantly restricting valid cycles.
4.  **Concretize/Constrain Dish Coverage:** Alter the cycle property concerning dishes. Instead of just resident adjacencies, mandate **partial dish coverage**: The cycle must cover fewer than (d choose 2) different pairs of dishes, making dish usage non-exhaustive and introducing variability. Connect this concretely to the homomorphism.
5.  **Link to Existing Concepts:** Maintain the town structure and core definitions but ensure the solution connects to `gr(T)` to preserve theme coherence.

A Hamiltonian resident cycle in ?_d is a sequence visiting each resident exactly once where consecutive residents share a dish, as do the first and last residents.

1.  **Variable n:** Replace the fixed number (24) with a variable `n`. Introduce a specific condition for `n` to be determined: the count `k` of its positive divisors (e.g., ""a positive integer `n` with exactly 7 positive divisors"").
2.  **Prime Divisor Constraint:** Modify ""divisors"" to ""prime divisors"" for at least one summation, adding a primality check requirement.
3.  **Cross-Term Operation:** Introduce a secondary, dependent term using `n+1`. Apply a reciprocal sum operation similar to the original but to the prime divisors of `n+1`, then multiply the two results.
4.  **Result Format:** Require the final answer as a simplified fraction, adding fraction arithmetic.
5.  **Complexity Justification:** The variable `n` requires identifying a suitable number first. Prime divisors add a filtering step and ligitimize the existence of non-trivial sums (`n` must be composite). The `n+1` term creates a dependency, and the multiplication/fraction requirement adds algebraic manipulation.

 ""Let $T(a, b)$ denote the number of ways to triangulate the polygon with vertices at $(0,0),(b, 0),(a, 1),(0,1)$, where each triangle has area $1 / 2$ and vertices at lattice points. The problem is to compute $T(7,7)$. It is easy to see that $T(a, 0)=T(0, b)=1$ for all $a$ and $b$. If $a$ and $b$ are both positive, then either one of the triangles includes the edge from $(a-1,1)$ to $(b, 0)$ or one of the triangles includes the edge from $(a, 1)$ to $(b-1,0)$, but not both. (In fact, as soon as there is an edge from $(a, 1)$ to $(x, 0)$ with $x<b$, there must be edges from $(a, 1)$ to $\\left(x^{\\prime}, 0\\right)$ for all $x \\leq x^{\\prime}<b$.) If there is an edge from $(a-1,1)$ to $(b, 0)$, then the number of ways to complete the triangulation is $T(a-1, b)$; if there is an edge from $(a, 1)$ to $(b-1,0)$, then the number of ways to complete the triangulation is $T(a, b-1)$; thus $T(a, b)=T(a-1, b)+T(a, b-1)$. The recursion and the initial conditions describe Pascal's triangle, so $T(a, b)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}a+b \\\\ a\\end{array}\\right)$.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. **Change the distance function**: Expand from a single prime (base 3) to incorporate multiple prime valuations. Define \(d(n)\) based on both 2-adic and 3-adic valuations: \(d(n) = 2^{-v_2(n)} + 3^{-v_3(n)}\), increasing complexity by requiring analysis of dual dependencies.
2. **Modify the range**: Shrink the range from ""less than 100"" to ""less than 30"" to intensify constraints and focus computations, addressing edge cases like higher valuations within tighter bounds.
3. **Add constraints**: Introduce that only houses with numbers congruent to 1 modulo 4 are considered, adding a modular arithmetic condition that necessitates additional reasoning and excludes some high-valuation candidates.
4. **Ensure coherence**: The modifications interconnect?new distance requires trade-off minimization between valuations under the modulo constraint for a reduced range, preserving the theme while increasing difficulty.

#Plan#:
1.  **Increase Exponent Scope:** Replace the fixed cube exponent `^3` with a variable integer exponent `k`, demanding computation for any `k` (not just `k=3`).
2.  **Introduce Additional Constraints:** Frame expression as root of specific minimal polynomial. Require solving a system: sum of `cos^k(?_j)` **plus** an additional related symmetric sum (e.g., `sin^k(?_j)` or a product).
3.  **Create Dependency:** Link the expression's value to the constant term of the minimal rational polynomial with rational coefficients having roots `e^{?i2?/7}, e^{?i4?/7}, e^{?i8?/7}` (excluding the trivial root 1).
4.  **Modify Angles:** Keep angles as roots of unity but frame them generically via a primitive root, requiring symbolic manipulation.

If $f:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow[2,3,4,5,1,7,8,6,9,10]$, then $f$ has one cycle of period 5 and one cycle of period 3 , so the period of $f$ is 15 . However,\n\n$$\nf(1)+f(2)+f(3)+f(4)+f(5)+f(6)+f(7)+f(8)+f(9)+f(10)=\n$$\n\n\n\n$$\n2+3+4+5+1+7+8+6+9+10=55,\n$$\n\nbecause $f$ just rearranges the order of the summands. So $s_{1}=s_{0}$, and for all $n, s_{n}=s_{n+1}$; in short, the period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is just 1 .\n\nIn order for $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ to have a period greater than $1, f$ must be many-to-one, so that some values occur more than once (and some values do not occur at all) in the sum $f(1)+f(2)+\\cdots+f(10)$ (or, in the original problem, $f(1)+f(2)+\\cdots+f(20)$ ). For example, consider the function $f_{2}$ below:\n\n$$\nf_{2}:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow[2,3,4,5,1,10,9,10,7,3]\n$$\n\nNote that $s_{1}=2+3+4+5+1+10+9+10+7+3 \\neq 55$, so $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is not immediately periodic. But $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ is eventually periodic, as the following argument shows. The function $f_{2}$ has two cycles: $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 1$, and $7 \\rightarrow 9 \\rightarrow 7$. There are also two paths that meet up with the first cycle: $6 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow \\cdots$ and $8 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 3 \\rightarrow \\cdots$. Thus for all $k$ in $T, f_{2}\\left(f_{2}(k)\\right)$ is an element of one of these two extended cycles. Thus $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ eventually becomes periodic.\n\nThe criterion that the function be many-to-one is necessary, but not sufficient, for $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ to have period greater than 1 . To see why, consider the function $g:[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] \\rightarrow$ $[2,3,4,5,6,1,8,7,8,7]$. This function is many-to-one, and contains two cycles, $1 \\rightarrow 2 \\rightarrow$ $3 \\rightarrow 4 \\rightarrow 5 \\rightarrow 6 \\rightarrow 1$ and $7 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 7$. But because $g(9)=8$ and $g(10)=7$, the sum $s_{1}=2+3+4+5+6+1+8+7+8+7$, while $s_{2}=3+4+5+6+1+2+7+8+7+8$. In fact, for $n>1, s_{n+1}=s_{n}$, because applying $f$ only permutes the 6 -cycle and switches the two 7 's and two 8's. That is, in the list $\\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(1), \\ldots, \\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(10)$, the values 7 and 8 both show up exactly twice. This cycle is balanced: each of its elements shows up the same number of times for all $n$ in the list $\\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(1), \\ldots, \\underbrace{(g \\circ \\cdots \\circ g)}_{n}(10)$, for all $n$ after a certain point. The conclusion is that not all many-to-one functions produce unbalanced cycles.\n\nThere are two ways a function $g$ can produce balanced cycles. First, the cycles can be selfcontained, so no element outside of the cycle is ever absorbed into the cycle, as happens with the 6-cycle in the example above. Alternatively, the outside elements that are absorbed into a cycle can all arrive at different points of the cycle, so that each element of the cycle occurs equally often in each iteration of $g$. In the example above, the values $g(9)=7$ and $g(10)=8$ balance the $7 \\rightarrow 8 \\rightarrow 7$ cycle. On the other hand, in the function $f_{2}$ above, $f(f(6))=f(f(8))=f(f(1))=3$, making the large cycle unbalanced: in $s_{2}$, the value 3 appears three times in $s_{2}$, but the value 2 only appears once in $s_{2}$.\n\nThe foregoing shows that only unbalanced cycles can affect the periodicity of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$. Because each element of a balanced cycle occurs equally often in each iteration, the period of that component of the sum $s_{n}$ attributed to the cycle is simply 1. (The case where $f$ is a permutation of $S$ is simply a special case of this result.) In the above example, the large cycle is\n\n\n\nunbalanced. Note the following results under $f_{2}$.\n\n| $n$ | $\\overbrace{\\left(f_{2} \\circ \\cdots \\circ f_{2}\\right)}^{n}(T)$ | $s_{n}$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| 1 | $[2,3,4,5,1,10,9,10,7,3]$ | 54 |\n| 2 | $[3,4,5,1,2,3,7,3,9,4]$ | 41 |\n| 3 | $[4,5,1,2,3,4,9,4,7,5]$ | 40 |\n| 4 | $[5,1,2,3,4,5,7,5,9,1]$ | 42 |\n| 5 | $[1,2,3,4,5,1,9,1,7,2]$ | 35 |\n| 6 | $[2,3,4,5,1,2,7,2,9,3]$ | 38 |\n| 7 | $[3,4,5,1,2,3,9,3,7,4]$ | 41 |\n| 8 | $[4,5,1,2,3,4,7,4,9,5]$ | 40 |\n| 9 | $[5,1,2,3,4,5,9,5,7,1]$ | 42 |\n\nThe period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ for $f_{2}$ is 5 , the period of the unbalanced cycle.\n\nThe interested reader may inquire whether all unbalanced cycles affect the periodicity of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$; we encourage those readers to explore the matter independently. For the purposes of solving this problem, it is sufficient to note that unbalanced cycles can affect $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ 's periodicity.\n\nFinally, note that an unbalanced $k$-cycle actually requires at least $k+1$ elements: $k$ to form the cycle, plus at least 1 to be absorbed into the cycle and cause the imbalance. For the original set $S$, one way to create such an imbalance would be to have $f(20)=f(1)=$ $2, f(2)=3, f(3)=4, \\ldots, f(19)=1$. This arrangement creates an unbalanced cycle of length 19. But breaking up into smaller unbalanced cycles makes it possible to increase the period of $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ even more, because then in most cases the period is the least common multiple of the periods of the unbalanced cycles. For example, $f:[1,2,3, \\ldots, 20]=$ $[2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,1,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,11,11,11]$ has an unbalanced cycle of length 9 and an unbalanced cycle of length 8 , giving $\\left\\{s_{n}\\right\\}$ a period of 72 .\n\nSo the goal is to maximize $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left\\{k_{1}, k_{2}, \\ldots, k_{m}\\right\\}$ such that $k_{1}+k_{2}+\\cdots+k_{m}+m \\leq 20$. With $m=2$, the maximal period is 72 , achieved with $k_{1}=9$ and $k_{2}=8$. With $m=3$, $k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3} \\leq 17$, but $\\operatorname{lcm}\\{7,6,4\\}=84<\\operatorname{lcm}\\{7,5,4\\}=140$. This last result can be obtained with unbalanced cycles of length 4,5 , and 7 , with the remaining four points entering the three cycles (or with one point forming a balanced cycle of length 1, i.e., a fixed point). Choosing larger values of $m$ decreases the values of $k$ so far that they no longer form long cycles: when $m=4, k_{1}+k_{2}+k_{3}+k_{4} \\leq 16$, and even if $k_{4}=2, k_{3}=3$, and $k_{2}=5$, for a period of 30 , the largest possible value of $k_{1}=6$, which does not alter the period. (Even $k_{1}=7, k_{2}=5$, and $k_{3}=k_{4}=2$ only yields a period of 70 .) Thus the maximum period of $s_{n}$ is $\\mathbf{1 4 0}$.

**Weaknesses for Complexity Increase**: Minimal variables, symmetry leading to zero, no dependency on additional parameters or real-world constraints.

Step 2  
**#Plan#:**  
1. **Introduce Additional Variables**: Replace fixed bases/arguments (2 and 8) with arbitrary positive real numbers \(p\) and \(q\), and keep \(T\) as the base. This discards inherent symmetry and forces analysis for arbitrary real inputs.  
2. **Redefine Expressions**: Replace \(2^{\log_{T} 8\) with \((T^{p})^{\log_{T} q}\) and \(8^{\log_{T} 2\) with \((T^{q})^{\log_{T} p}\). This maintains logarithmic complexity but requires expanding exponential forms using identities.

**#Elements Identified#:**
- **Input Source:** The numbers from positions 7 and 9, which are undefined and lack context, allowing for a more complex definition.
- **Set Definition:** \( S \) is defined as the set of prime factors of the input numbers; \( p \) and \( q \) are derived as the two least distinct elements of \( S \) with \( p < q \), a simple selection method.
- **Geometric Constraints:** The hexagon \( H E X A G O \) is inscribed in circle \( \omega \), with all interior angles \( 120^\circ \), and side lengths specifically assigned as \( H E = X A = G O = p \) and \( E X = A G = O H = q \).

1. **Expand and Redefine Input Source:** Replace the ambiguous ""positions 7 and 9"" with a recursively defined sequence (e.g., Padovan sequence) to increase computational depth, requiring solvers to generate terms before extracting inputs.
2. **Modify Set Definition and Element Selection:** Broaden \( S \) to include prime factors from the sum of sequence terms (positions 5 and 8) and their product, ensuring a larger set. Redefine \( p \) and \( q \) as the multiplicative roots of a quadratic equation derived from \( S \), adding algebraic complexity.
3. **Add Geometric Constraint and Dependency:** Introduce that for the hexagon to be cyclic, the diagonal \( H X \) must equal the diameter of \( \omega \), creating a geometric link between \( p \), \( q \), and the circle. This requires solvers to derive a parameter relationship before area computation.

Compute the smallest possible $n$ such that there are at least $T$ ways of selecting the helpers under these conditions.","Step 1  
#Elements Identified#:  
- Variable: $T = 184$ (fixed value).  
- Participants: Group of $n$ friends (homogeneous except for potential specific roles or constraints).  
- Actions: Selecting two distinct friends for setup and two distinct others for teardown, implying no overlap and four distinct helpers in total; the selections are unordered pairs.  
- Core concept: Combinatorial selection with distinct roles (setup and teardown teams), focusing on the number of ways as $\binom{n}{2} \times \binom{n-2}{2}$.  
- Theme: Camping scenario with helper assignments; simplicity allows for expansions like additional tasks or constraints.  
- Conditions: No inherent constraints; complexity can be added through more tasks, role differentiations, or selection restrictions.  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
1. Increase the number of tasks: Add a third distinct task (e.g., first aid duty) requiring one helper to expand the helper count to five, changing the combinatorial structure to $\binom{n}{2} \times \binom{n-2}{2} \times \binom{n-4}{1}$ or similar, increasing the number of selections and requiring larger $n$ for a comparable $T$.  
2. Add a specific constraint: Introduce a named friend (Alex) who must be part of the setup team, reducing the free choices and adding fixed selection logic, altering the number of ways to $(n-1) \times \cdots$ for setup.  
3. Add role differentiation within a team: For the teardown team, require selecting a leader (e.g., one of the two teardown helpers), making the team choices ordered and increasing the multiplicative factor via $2 \times \binom{n-2}{2}$ for teardown.  
- Justification: All components interconnect logically?the new task adds helpers, the constraint reduces flexibility for setup, and the role differentiation increases variability for teardown, collectively demanding more intricate combinatorial reasoning. $T=184$ is retained for consistency, but now it applies to a more complex scenario, adjusting the minimal $n$ target.  
- Avoid ambiguity: Alex is explicitly named; first aid is a distinct task; leader selection is clear; $n$ must be large enough (e.g., at least 5) for selections, handled implicitly.

*   **Roots:** The roots of the first are `r` and `s`. The roots of the second are `r+1` and `s+1`.
*   **Relationships:** The roots of the second quadratic are a linear shift (+1) of the roots of the first.
*   **Parameters:** The problem involves finding the parameter `c` given a relationship between `b` and `c` via the roots.
*   **Core Actions:** Use properties of quadratic equations (sum and product of roots) to relate the coefficients `b` and `c` via the root shift.
*   **Theme:** Connecting root properties and linear transformations between quadratic equations.
*   **Manipulation Points:** Root shift magnitude/direction, coefficients (constant term, linear term, or leading coefficient), number of equations/variables involved, type of root transformation (beyond linear shift), complexity of required output.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Increase Equations:** Introduce a third quadratic equation to increase interconnectedness. The original problem involves only two quadratics (one generating roots, one with shifted roots). Add a third equation whose roots are derived differently from `r` and `s`.
2.  **Diversify Root Transformation:** Instead of applying the same shift (`+1`) to both roots for the second equation, use a complex transformation (reciprocal roots) for the third equation. For the second equation, replace the constant shift `+1` with a variable shift `+k`.
3.  **Increase Parameters & Dependencies:** Complicate parameter determination by:
    *   Making both the linear coefficient and constant term of the first equation variables (current linear term `b` is unknown variable, constant `93` is given; change `93` to an unknown constant `p`). `p = r*s`
    *   Making the shift magnitude `k` a variable.
    *   Adding the constant term `d` of the third equation as a variable.
    *   Providing specific constraints between `p`, `k`, and known roots to close the system and justify the existence of a solution: the sum of the roots of the third quadratic is `-10`, and the sum of the products of the roots pairwise for all three quadratics is `0`.
4.  **Expand Output:** Instead of finding a single value `c`, require finding multiple parameters: `c`, `d`, and `k`, as all are now interdependent variables.

Step 3
#Rewritten Instruction#:
Three quadratic equations are given: The first has roots \(r\) and \(s\): \(a x^{2} + b x + p = 0\) (where \(a \neq 0\)). The second has roots \(r+k\) and \(s+k\): \(x^{2} - u x + c = 0\). The third has roots \(\frac{1}{r}\) and \(\frac{1}{s}\): \(x^{2} + v x + d = 0\). Suppose the sum of the roots of the third quadratic is `-10` and the sum of `rs + (r+k)(s+k) + 1/(rs)` equals `0`. Compute the values of \(c\), \(d\), and \(k\).

The third, \(x^{2} + v x + d = 0\), has roots \(\frac{1}{r}\) and \(\frac{1}{s}\).

- Task: minimize \(a\)  
- Theme: geometry of polygons, arithmetic sequences, optimization

#Plan#:
- Modify variables/constraints: Require the common difference \(d\) to be a positive integer to force integer steps, restricting possible values and increasing solving complexity.  
- Add constraint: Require all interior angles distinct to exclude trivial cases (\(d = 0\)) and introduce uniqueness condition.  
- Introduce geometric dependency: Specify that the smallest interior angle is at vertex K to add positional constraint, linking the arithmetic sequence to vertex labeling, which affects assignment feasibility.

#Elements Identified#:  
The core operation is factoring a complex number with an irrational component. Key elements include: the given complex number \(z = -142 + 333\sqrt{5}i\) with fixed coefficients; factorizations of the form \((a + b\sqrt{5}i)(c + d\sqrt{5}i)\); constraints that \(a, b, c, d\) must be positive integers; an objective to compute \(\min(a+b, c+d)\); and two example factorizations with mixed-sign coefficients serving as hints about possible but non-positive factor pairs. The theme involves arithmetic in the ring \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-5}]\) or similar, leveraging norms and multiplicative properties.  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
To increment complexity, modify three components: (1) Change the definition of \(z\) by specifying it implicitly as a root of a quadratic equation rather than providing explicit values, requiring derivation of \(z\) as an initial step. (2) Add constraints that the factors must be primitive, i.e., \(\gcd(a,b) = 1\) and \(\gcd(c,d) = 1\), to ensure coprime coefficients and demand additional checks. (3) Introduce a dependency on a real-variable condition by making the imaginary part positive for clarity, enhancing reasoning steps. This plan increases complexity through derivation, stricter constraints, and an unambiguous variable condition without introducing unwarranted variables.

*   **Shape:** Parallelogram ABCD

*   **Area Conditions:** [B'CD] = [ABD'] = [BC C'] (Three equal areas).
*   **Target:** Compute tan ?ABD.
*   **Fixed Elements:** Point A, properties of parallelograms and rotation.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Introduce a Variable Ratio for Areas:** Instead of the three areas being equal, set two specified areas equal to each other and make them *proportional* to the third area by a variable constant $k$. Specifically, set $[B'CD] = [ABD']$ and $[B'CD] = k[BC C']$ or $[ABD'] = k[BC C']$. The problem must then solve for $\tan \angle ABD$ in terms of $k$, or find $k$ given an additional constraint.
2.  **Add a Length Ratio Constraint:** Introduce a specific length ratio involving the image points to fix the configuration. For example, state that AD = m * MD', where M is a newly defined point, such as the intersection point of diagonals, midpoint of BD, or foot of a perpendicular. The problem then requires solving for $\tan \angle ABD$ in terms of both $k$ and $m$, or to find a relationship between $k$ and $m$ satisfying the condition. This adds an additional dependency.
3.  **Concretize the Rotation:** Instead of a general rotation resulting in D on AB', specify the rotation angle as $\theta$. The condition D on AB' and the area/length ratios then constrain $\theta$. This requires expressing $\theta$ in terms of the parameters or eliminating it.
4.  **Interconnect Components:** Ensure the new area ratio $k$ and the length ratio $m$ are integral to the expression derived for $\tan \angle ABD$, and that the rotation angle $\theta$ depends on these variables through the conditions imposed.

- Participants: Eight values formed by \(n\) and \(\lfloor \sqrt[k]{n} \rfloor\) for \(k=2,3,4,5,6,7,8\).  
- Actions: Computing the integer roots and their floors.  
- Conditions: All values must be distinct.  
- Theme: Analyzing properties of integer roots and ensuring uniqueness under the floor function.  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
1. Increase the number of roots from 8 to 12 exponents (\(k=1\) to \(12\)) to expand the solution space and add computational depth.  
2. Replace the distinctness condition with pairwise coprimality (i.e., \(\gcd(v_i, v_j) = 1\) for all \(i \neq j\)), preserving distinctness for values >1 and introducing number-theoretic complexity.  
3. Add a real-world constraint that \(n\) must be coprime to the product of the first 12 prime numbers, ensuring interdependency between \(n\) and the root values.  
- Justification: Expanding exponents increases the solution search difficulty; pairwise coprimality requires stronger number-theoretic checks; the prime product constraint models resource limitations in computational problems.

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
1. Increase complexity by generalizing the factorial-like operation to a multi-factorial with variable step size \(k\), defined as \(n!^{(k)}\), which decreases by step \(k\). This adds a layer of abstraction and requires handling multiple-step cases.  
2. Modify the operations: Change the left-hand side to \((n!)!^{(a)}\) where \(a=2\) (applying a double factorial to \(n!\) instead of single factorial) and the right-hand side to \(m!^{(b)}\) with \(b=3\) (triple factorial for \(m=2012\)). This introduces inequality in step sizes, deepening the reasoning for divisibility.  
3. Add a constraint: Restrict \(n\) to prime positive integers, which adds a primality condition and reduces possible values, requiring additional checks.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Generalize the Area Constraint:** Replace the fixed area fraction \(\frac{35}{37}\) with a parameterized expression \(\sqrt{k}\), where \(k\) is a positive real constant, making the area relationship more complex to derive and involving an additional parameter. This requires solving for the parameter later.
2.  **Add Geometric Constraint:** Introduce an additional geometric condition related to the shape of the parallelogram. Specifically, require that the parallelogram contains no obtuse angles. This adds a non-trivial constraint (\(\cos(2\theta) \geq 0\)) that must be incorporated into the minimization problem, increasing the interdependence of variables and reasoning needed.
3.  **Add Variable Constraint:** Impose an inequality constraint linking the magnitude and argument of \(z\). The constraint \(|z| \cdot \cos^2(\arg(z)) \geq 1\) adds complexity by forcing the minimization to consider a restricted domain and increasing variable dependence.

1.  **Increase Die Complexity:** Replace the single biased die with **three distinct biased dice** (Die A, Die B, Die C). Define their biases using parameters that must be derived: P(X=k) = c*k for Die A, P(Y=k) = d/(k+1) for Die B (require solving for constants c, d ensuring probability laws hold).
2.  **Deepen Success Condition:** Require the sum of a specific pair of dice (e.g., A+B) to be relevant for the final condition. The final success condition becomes multifaceted: the sum must be **sequential** (differ by 1), **prime**, **and** satisfy A+B ? {12, 20}.
3.  **Concretize & Add Constraint:** Explicitly set the number of rolls to **five rolls total**: A rolled once, B rolled once, C rolled three times (C1, C2, C3). Add a constraint that the probability of interest involves the outcomes from rolls A, B, and C2 *only*, specifically: Compute P( [A + B is prime] AND [|A + B - C2| = 1] AND [A + B ? {12, 20}] ). Require the final probability to be expressed as a simplified fraction *or* the coefficient of a specific term in a generating function.

- Point P in the plane.
- Condition that triangles PAB, PBC, and PCA are all isosceles and non-degenerate.
- Computation of the number of such points P.
- Approximation provided for cos 80? ? 0.17 to aid computation.
- Theme: Geometric problem involving isosceles triangles defined by a point and the vertices, with a focus on enumeration.

Step 2
#Plan#:
- Change the triangle ABC to be scalene with given side lengths to increase asymmetry and computational difficulty, specifically setting BC = 10, AB = 9, AC = 5.
- Modify the isosceles condition to require that for each triangle (PAB, PBC, and PCA), P must be the vertex of the isosceles triangle (i.e., PA = PB for PAB, PB = PC for PBC, PC = PA for PCA), which implies PA = PB = PC, so P is the circumcenter. This concentrates on a key point but integrates coordinate geometry for verification.
- Add a numerical computation constraint with approximations for angles derived from the side lengths (e.g., cos B ? 0.87, cos C ? 0.44) to ensure practical solving and maintain the need for trigonometric application.

- Theme: Solving for a sum under product-based constraints with integer solutions.
- Core Structure: The problem uses fixed constants (20 and 12) and relies on finding common divisors to satisfy the equations and achieve the minimum sum. Only three variables with two constraints leave limited complexity.

Step 2
#Plan#:
- Expand the number of variables by introducing a fourth variable, $w$, which maintains the theme but increases interdependencies.
- Add multiple constraints to deepen reasoning: Modify the original equations to $xy = 72$ and $yz = 48$ for more complex factorization, and include a new constraint $x w = 108$ to tie $w$ to the system. This creates simultaneous equations that must be solved collectively.
- Incorporate a real-world constraint: Specify that $x$, $y$, $z$, $w$ represent distinct dimensions in a geometric context, such as sides of rectangles with given areas, adding a dependency that variables must be pairwise distinct. This forces evaluation of valid combinations beyond divisor checks.
- Increase reasoning: Use larger numbers (72, 48, 108) to amplify factorization difficulty, and require minimization under all constraints, ensuring the plan modifies variables, conditions, and context coherently without overcomplication.

- **Variables**: $T$ (initially fixed at 8), the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$, and the coordinate $x$ to be computed.

- **Participants**: Points $A$, $B$, and the point on the perpendicular bisector.
- **Actions**: Compute $x$ based on geometric properties.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. Modify $T$ from fixed to unknown, requiring solving for it: Add a constraint that the length of $\overline{AB}$ is a specific value (e.g., 12) to introduce an equation for $T$.
2. Add variability to $B$: Change $B$'s y-coordinate to a dependent variable $U$, where $U = 2T + 1$, to increase dependencies.
3. Change the point from fixed $(x,3)$ to variable $(x,y)$: Make $y$ dynamic by setting $y = \frac{x}{2}$ and add that the point must also lie on the line $y = \frac{x}{2}$, requiring solving for both $x$ and $y$ with this constraint.
4. Ensure coherence: With $T$ unknown, $U$ dependent, and the new point constraint, solve the system for $T$, then use to find the perpendicular bisector, then solve for $x$ and $y$ under the line constraint, ensuring all variables interconnect logically.

To increase complexity:  
1. Modify the logarithmic arguments: Introduce a multiplicative constant \(k\) in the inner log on the left side, changing \(\log_2(\log_2 x)\) to \(\log_2(k \log_2 x)\). This adds a parameter that scales the inner argument, requiring handling in the equation.

3. Add a constraint: Require that \(\log_4 x\) must be an integer, which concretizes solutions by restricting to discrete values and adds dependencies between variables.  
All components interconnect: \(k\) modifies the log relationship, the integer constraint on \(\log_4 x\) ties to \(x\), and solving must satisfy domains like \(\log_4 x > 0\) and \(k \log_2 x > 0\). This enhances reasoning with parameter dependence and case analysis.

#Elements Identified#:  
- **Variables**: $k$ (least common multiple of the numbers in $\mathcal{S}$), $\mathcal{S}$ (set $\{1, 2, \ldots, 30\}$)  
- **Conditions**: Determine the number of divisors of $k$ such that exactly 28 elements of $\mathcal{S}$ divide them (i.e., $|\{s \in \mathcal{S} \mid s \text{ divides } d\}| = 28$).  
- **Participants**: Positive integer divisors of $k$.  
- **Actions/Processes**: Compute $k$ as LCM of $\mathcal{S}$, find divisors satisfying the exact divisibility count.  
- **Theme**: Connection between LCM, divisors, and exact divisibility by elements of $\mathcal{S}$; involves properties of prime exponents and combinatorial counting.  
- **Manipulable Elements**: Size of $\mathcal{S}$ (increase $n$ to 50), exact number (change from 28 to 48), additional divisor constraint (require square-free divisors to restrict exponent values).  

**Step 2**  
#Plan#:  
1. Increase the size of $\mathcal{S}$ from 30 to 50 elements to escalate the number of prime factors and exponents in $k$, intensifying computational difficulty for LCM and divisor analysis.  
2. Change the exact divisibility count from a fixed value (28) to $n-2$ (i.e., 48 for $n=50$) to maintain high proportion complexity and align with theme while being non-trivial.  
3. Introduce an additional constraint that divisors must be square-free, forcing exponent values to 0 or 1 for all prime factors, which adds dimension to divisor selection and interacts non-trivially with the divisibility count by reducing eligible $s \in \mathcal{S}$.  
- **Logical Coherence**: All changes are interconnected: $\mathcal{S}$ size increase raises base complexity; $n-2$ count demands near-total divisibility; square-free constraint filters divisors and affects which elements can divide them. Avoid unnecessary variables; use $n=50$ for concreteness and clear criteria (e.g., square-free defined as lacking squared prime factors).

2. Modify the uniform buffer condition to be non-uniform and dependent on face area (add geometric dependency and conditional logic based on face properties).  
3. Add a constraint that the buffer distance differs for the pair with the smallest face area (introduce comparative area analysis and variable buffer assignment per dimension).

2.  **Add an Internal Constraint:** Introduce a relationship between `x` and `y` within the pair requirement. Require that `x` and `y` are coprime (`gcd(x, y) = 1`). This adds a significant number theory layer filtering potential integer solutions derived from the modified equation.

- Theme: Signature multiplicity?identify non-unique signatures and equivalent labels with shared window tuples.
- Constraints: Original lacks variables, constraints, and depth; it focuses on one instance.

### Step 2
**#Plan#**:
- **Modify variables**: Generalize n and p (from fixed n=5, p=3) to be any positive integers with p ? n, requiring derivation.
- **Add constraints**: Require the label to start and end with specified values (e.g., min and max elements), adding real-world positioning constraints that affect signature consistency.
- **Incorporate signature properties**: Task includes verifying that the signature is possible (non-impossible) and not unique before proceeding, adding reasoning on existence and multiplicity.
- **Expand actions**: From finding one label to finding at least two distinct n-labels sharing the signature, with proofs of feasibility to increase output complexity.
- **Ensure interconnectedness**: Signature possibility/uniqueness depends on p and n; label constraints must preserve block calculations; all added elements tie to core signature analysis.
- **Avoid ambiguity**: Define methods for handling constraints and signature verification explicitly (e.g., direct computation from definitions).
- **Control word count**: Keep rewrite within +30 words via concise phrasing.

2863,"An $\boldsymbol{n}$-label is a permutation of the numbers 1 through $n$. For example, $J=35214$ is a 5 -label and $K=132$ is a 3 -label. For a fixed positive integer $p$, where $p \leq n$, consider consecutive blocks of $p$ numbers in an $n$-label. For example, when $p=3$ and $L=263415$, the blocks are 263,634,341, and 415. We can associate to each of these blocks a $p$-label that corresponds to the relative order of the numbers in that block. For $L=263415$, we get the following:

$$
\underline{263} 415 \rightarrow 132 ; \quad 2 \underline{63415} \rightarrow 312 ; \quad 26 \underline{341} 5 \rightarrow 231 ; \quad 263 \underline{415} \rightarrow 213
$$

Moving from left to right in the $n$-label, there are $n-p+1$ such blocks, which means we obtain an $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels. For $L=263415$, we get the 4 -tuple $(132,312,231,213)$. We will call this $(n-p+1)$-tuple the $\boldsymbol{p}$-signature of $L$ (or signature, if $p$ is clear from the context) and denote it by $S_{p}[L]$; the $p$-labels in the signature are called windows. For $L=263415$, the windows are $132,312,231$, and 213 , and we write

$$
S_{3}[263415]=(132,312,231,213)
$$

More generally, we will call any $(n-p+1)$-tuple of $p$-labels a $p$-signature, even if we do not know of an $n$-label to which it corresponds (and even if no such label exists). A signature that occurs for exactly one $n$-label is called unique, and a signature that doesn't occur for any $n$-labels is called impossible. A possible signature is one that occurs for at least one $n$-label.

In this power question, you will be asked to analyze some of the properties of labels and signatures.

2.   **Add Modular Constraint:** Introduce a non-trivial modular constraint on `n` itself (`n ? 5 mod 6`). This restricts possible forms and necessitates considering multiplicative behavior under modulo.
3.   **Introduce Factorization Requirement:** Require `n` to have a specific primality structure. Mandate that `n` is a product of two *coprime* factors, `a` and `b` (`n = a * b`, `gcd(a, b) = 1`). This necessitates understanding how divisor sums decompose over coprime factors.

Introduce ambiguity about the polygon's shape or the sequence of midpoints by stating it's ""a polygon"" rather than explicitly a square that must be deduced implicitly via the area given (implying it's a square).

2. **Modify polynomial structure**: Change to \( T(x) = kx^3 + x^2 + Bx + C \) to add a leading coefficient \( k \neq 1 \), requiring normalization via sum of roots.  
3. **Introduce interdependent variables**: Require \( \beta = \alpha - \frac{\pi}{6} \) and impose the equation \( e^{\alpha} + \sin \beta = 2 \) to couple exponential and trigonometric constraints.

*   **Theme:** Solving a system resulting from combining sequences using initial terms.

Step 2
**#Plan#**:
1.  **Modify $b_n$:** Change the geometric sequence's property itself. Instead of being purely geometric, assert it has a **minimum positive period of 5**, making $b_{n+5} = b_n$ for all $n$, while still maintaining $c_n=a_n+b_n$.
2.  **Modify $a_n$:** Introduce a **direct proportional relationship** between specific terms of $a_n$ and $b_n$. Require $b_k = k \cdot a_k$ for some $k$ (divergent from the given $c_n$ points).
3.  **Amplify Target:** Increase the required computation point from $c_5$ to $c_7$. The periodicity added in (1) makes $b_5$, $b_6$, $b_7$ depend on $b_0$, $b_1$, $b_2$ ($\equiv b_7$), requiring different solving logic compared to the smooth progression to $c_5$. Combining with the shift needed for (2) adds complexity.
4.  **Re-index $b_n$:** To make the period and proportionality constraint interact non-trivially, impose the proportionality $b_{k} = k \cdot a_{k}$ specifically for $k=0$ (a term before $n=1$). This forces consideration of $b_0$ and $a_0$, linking to the periodic condition $b_5 = b_0$.
5.  **Justify Connections:** The period of $b_n$ introduces cyclic dependencies (back to $b_0, b_1$). The $b_0 = 0 \cdot a_0$ constraint ($k=0$) links $a_0$ and $b_0$, creating a critical connection point between the sequences affecting all indices via $a_n$'s recursion and $b_n$'s periodicity.

Then the system $x \\equiv$ $p(s) \\bmod 625$ and $x \\equiv b(s) \\bmod 16$ can be rewritten as $x=p(s)+625 m$ and $x=b(s)+16 n$ for integers $m$ and $n$.

1.  **Modify T:** Replace the fixed constant `T = 35` with a dependant variable expression. Replace `T` with `K`, where `K` is defined as the `n`-th triangular number, `K = n(n-1)/2`, and `n` must be found as a solution condition alongside `x`. This introduces combinatorial concepts and an integer variable.
2.  **Add Secondary Condition:** Require the solution `x` to also satisfy a condition about its nearest integer neighbor. Add the constraint that `|x - \operatorname{round}(x)| > 1/5`. This necessitates checking a geometric condition related to proximity to integers.
3.  **Add Output Constraint:** Require the solution `x` to be expressed in a specific reduced rational form `p/q`, demanding simplification.
4.  **Constrain Solution Space:** Introduce bounds on the solution variable `n`, specifying `2 < n < 11`. This prevents trivial searches for large `n` and forces analysis within an explicit range.
5.  **Link Objectives:** Maintain finding smallest `x` as the primary objective, but tie it to finding the integer `n` satisfying the triangular number definition and boundary condition.

#Plan#:  
- **Add an additional tangency constraint**: Modify so that the sphere is also tangent to the flat base surface. This introduces an extra equation into the system and requires solving for tangency to both the edges and a separate plane.  
- **Change the sphere's position constraint**: Remove the coplanarity condition between the sphere's center and the apex vertices.

- **Specify the type of edge for tangency**: Clarify that the tangent edge is a ""lateral edge"" (specifically, an edge connecting the apex to a base vertex, not a base edge) to eliminate ambiguity and add precision. Ensure this is consistent across the symmetric arrangement.  
Justification: This plan increases complexity by adding dependencies between variables (e.g., tangency to base affects center height) and requires deeper 3D reasoning. All elements are interconnected: The additional tangency and edge specificity build on the base/edge interactions, while removing coplanarity adds difficulty by reducing direct relations.

*   **Objects/Environment**: A locked room, $n$ light switches (all initially off, numbered 1 to $n$), a door.
*   **Actions**: Each minute, Elizabeth flips exactly $k$ distinct switches. Flip: on->off or off->on.
*   **Goal Condition**: Escape occurs if, at the end of any minute, all switches are on.
*   **Objective Function**: $E(n, k)$ = minimum minutes to escape, or $\infty$ if impossible.
*   **Parameters**: $n$ (total switches), $k$ (switches flipped per minute). Constraint: $k \leq n$.
*   **Process**: Repeated discrete-time actions resulting in state changes. Solution involves finding a minimum-length sequence of flip sets leading to the all-on state.

*   **Key for Complexity**: Switch behavior is currently identical and independent. The escape condition depends only on the current state.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Modify Switch Behavior (Increase State Complexity)**: Instead of simple on/off, each switch has multiple states (e.g., Off -> Stage1 -> Stage2 -> ... -> On) or multiple contributing flips required. This breaks the simple $\mathbb{Z}_2$ model and adds linear algebra/combinatorial depth.
2.  **Modify Escape Condition (Increase Constraint Complexity)**: Escape requires not only all switches to be on, but also that a specific total number of flips has been performed on each switch within the minute they become on. This introduces critical timing dependencies between flips across minutes.
3.  **Modify the Locking Mechanism (Add Dynamic Constraint)**: A ""panic"" trigger is added: if the *exact* sequence of flip counts per switch over the last $t$ minutes matches a forbidden pattern derived from $n$ and $k$ ($t$ depends on $n$ and $k$), the door permanently locks. This introduces a dynamic, pattern-recognition constraint throughout the process.
4.  **Justification & Connection**: The modified switch behavior requires intricate planning since flipping affects not just it and its neighbors, but also its path to ""On"". The escape condition adds per-switch historical tracking and forces consideration of *when* flips occur relative to others. The panic trigger adds a constant dynamic threat based on recent flip sequences and depends critically on $n$ and $k$, forcing Elizabeth to avoid specific patterns derived from the problem parameters. All components link through the state transitions caused by the $k$-flips per minute.

Remove specific examples to focus on the given parameters.

- **Add New Constraint**: Incorporate that flipping any switch consumes one unit of energy per flip, and Elizabeth starts with finite energy $S = n^2$ units, adding a resource limitation that affects the sequence used for $E(n, k)$.
- **Enhance Escape Condition**: Require that all switches must remain on for at least one full minute after first achieving the all-on state to escape, adding temporal consistency to the goal.

*   **Core Condition:** Each of `n`, `n+1`, `n+2` must be a product of exactly two primes (semiprimes), allowing the primes to be repeated.
*   **Selection Criterion:** Find the *third least* positive integer `n` satisfying the core condition.
*   **Constraints:** Positive integers, consecutiveness, semiprime definition.
*   **Theme:** Finding clustered sequences of semiprime numbers.

Step 2
**#Plan#:**
1.  **Extend Sequence Length:** Increase the sequence of consecutive numbers that must be semiprimes from 3 (`n` to `n+2`) to 4 (`n` to `n+3`).
2.  **Add Adjacent Primality Constraint:** Introduce the requirement that the number immediately *preceding* the sequence (`n-1`) and the number immediately *following* the sequence (`n+4`) must both be *prime numbers*. This adds constraints on the boundaries.
3.  **Impose Distinct Prime Factor Constraint:** For *one specific member* within the new extended sequence (e.g., `n+2`), require that its two prime factors are *distinct* (removing the allowance for squares of primes).
4.  **Maintain Selection Criterion:** Keep the requirement to find the *third least* such positive integer `n`.

Define a lucky trio to be a sequence of three consecutive integers, $n, n+1, n+2$, each of which is a semiprime. Note that a lucky trio must contain exactly one multiple of 3. Also note that the middle number in a lucky trio must be even. To see this, note that if the first and last numbers in a lucky trio were both even, then exactly one of these numbers would be a multiple of 4 . But neither $2,3,4$ nor 4,5,6 is a lucky trio, and if a list of three consecutive integers contains a multiple of 4 that is greater than 4 , this number cannot be a semiprime. Using this conclusion and because $3,4,5$ is not a lucky trio, it follows that the middle number of a lucky trio cannot be a multiple of 4 . Hence it is necessary that a lucky trio has the form $4 k+1,4 k+2,4 k+3$, for some positive integer $k$, with $2 k+1$ being a prime. Note that $k \\neq 1(\\bmod 3)$ because when $k=1$, the sequence $5,6,7$ is not a lucky trio, and when $k>1,4 k+2$ would be a multiple of 6 greater than 6 , hence it cannot be a semiprime.

#Elements Identified#:
- **Variables**: \( n \) (positive integer)
- **Conditions**: Sum of digits of \( n \), denoted \( S(n) \), must satisfy \( S(n) = 5 \times S(n + 2019) \)
- **Participants**: Implicitly, the digit sum function \( S(\cdot) \)
- **Actions**: Compute the minimal \( n \) meeting the condition
- **Theme**: Relationships between digit sums under a fixed additive offset (2019)
- **Manipulable Components**: The multiplier (5), the offset value (2019), the definition of the offset (e.g., make it depend on \( n \)), the digit sum operation (e.g., involve other digit functions), and additional constraints on \( n \) (e.g., digit properties).

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. Modify the offset from a fixed constant (2019) to a variable function of \( n \): use \( P(n) \) (the product of the digits of \( n \)) as the new offset, introducing dependency on digit properties.
2. Add a constraint to avoid undefined/trivial cases: require that \( n \) has no zero digits to ensure \( P(n) > 0 \) and prevent \( S(n) = 5 \times S(n) \) inconsistencies.
3. Introduce an additional digit-based function: incorporate \( P(n) \) explicitly in the digit sum comparison, increasing reasoning complexity through interdependency between digit sum and product.
- *Interconnectivity*: The new offset \( P(n) \) depends on \( n \)'s digits, directly linking it to the digit sum condition. The constraint (no zero digits) guarantees \( P(n) \) is valid, and the overall problem requires simultaneous handling of multiple digit properties. The complexity is justified by the variable offset and strengthened constraints.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. **Replace the angle constraint:** Change `sin ?LEO = 1/T` to `sin(?LEO + ?) = k/T` for a variable acute angle ?, increasing trigonometric complexity.
2. **Generalize side expressions:** Replace both `LE` and `EO` with cubic polynomials in `n`:  
   `LE = a?n3 + a?n2 + a?n + a?`,  
   `EO = b?n3 + b?n2 + b?n + b?`,   
   adding constraints `a? = -b?`, `a?,b? >0`, and specifying degrees explicitly.
3. **Impose perimeter constraint:** Introduce `LO + LE + EO = c?n2 + c?` to force dependency between sides.
4. **Maintain area minimization:** Ensure the area `[LEO]` still requires solving for `n` and ? under new constraints.
5. **Parameters for adaptability:** Define where coefficients (e.g., `c?, c?, k, T`) are user-defined or chosen from sets to avoid arbitrary values.

2. Add constraint on chord lengths: Include that the length of chord $A_1 A_k$ must be equal to the diameter of the circumcircle to reinforce geometric dependency.

#Elements Identified#:
*   **Marbles:** Fixed quantities (20 Lavender, 12 Emerald), Unknown quantity (Orange)
*   **Key Process:** Probability calculation (P(Orange) = 1/y)
*   **Core Equation:** Relates unknown marbles (Orange = x), total marbles (32 + x), and probability (x / (32 + x) = 1/y)
*   **Solution Goal:** Find y such that it satisfies the probability equation *and* results in a valid probability (integer marbles, P between 0 and 1), then sum possible integer y.
*   **Key Constraint:** Implicit constraints requiring x and y to be positive integers and P=1/y to be a valid probability for the setup.
*   **Theme:** Basic discrete probability requiring solving for parameter constraints.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Add a Fourth Marble Type:** Introduce Crimson marbles with an *initial* fixed quantity (C) to increase variable interdependence and total count complexity.
2.  **Dual Probability Conditions:** Instead of one probability condition, require *two* distinct probability conditions linked to the same `y` denominator: P(Orange) = k/y and P(Emerald) = m/y, requiring `k` and `m` to be coprime so we can solve for `y` based on each individually and find common solutions.
3.  **Add Specific Prime Constraint:** Constrain the total number of marbles to be a prime number less than 100. This adds a significant layer of primality testing and restricts the solution space based on a global constraint.
4.  **Adjust Fixed Counts (Concretizing):** Change Lavender count to a smaller number (15) for better interaction with the new constraints and prime total.
5.  **Justification:** The two probability conditions force solving for `y` with respect to two different divisors related to the fixed counts (Emerald k and Crimson m), introducing a common denominator requirement and increasing algebraic manipulation. The prime total constraint adds a significant non-linear constraint requiring testing divisibility and primality within a range. Coprime `k` and `m` ensure distinct necessary conditions for `y`.

2. **Introduce coefficient constraint**:  
   - Demand that \(f(x)\) is a **monic** polynomial (leading coefficient 1) to limit symmetry options and force integer coefficients in solutions.

- **Add a new constraint involving digits**: Require that the sum of the digits of \( T \) in base \( b \) must be a prime number, introducing a digit-level property that depends on \( b \) and necessitates digit decomposition for each candidate base.  
- **Introduce a variable constraint**: Add the condition that \( b \) must be greater than the number formed by the digits of \( T \) in base 10 (e.g., for \( T = 41 \), digits are 4 and 1, forming 41, so \( b > 41 \)), creating dependency on \( T \)'s decimal representation and tightening the range of possible \( b \).

3. **Refine interest modeling**: Specify a nominal annual rate (2.4%) compounded monthly, necessitating rate-per-period derivation and geometric series summation.  
4. **Embed real-world dependencies**: Payments tied to calendar dates, with compounding periods varying per contribution.  
5. **Ensure coherence**: Initial deposit compounds for 120 months; annual contributions compound for decreasing periods (108 to 12 months), linked via explicit dates and interest rules.

2.  **Abstract Starting Parameters:** Abstract the fixed foci. Instead of given coordinates, **derive foci coordinates** using constraints: they are symmetric across the origin and not on the axes.
3.  **Replace Pass-Through Constraint:** Remove the given pass-through point. Replace it with the constraint that the ellipse is **tangent to a specified line** (e.g., `y = -x`), requiring solving to find the point(s) of tangency to determine `s`.
4.  **Maintain Target:** Keep the task to compute the enclosed area. Ensure the problem focuses on this final ask.
5.  **Ensure Solvability & Connection:** Require symmetry across the origin for foci positions (e.g., if A=(a,b), then C=(-a,-b), and B distinct), ensuring coordinate determination depends on the tangency condition and symmetry. The tangency condition and the ellipse equation with three foci connect variables and drive complexity.

#### Step 1  
**#Elements Identified#**:  
- **Variables**: Roots of the quadratic equation, denoted as \(r\) and \(s\).  
- **Indices**: The parameter \(k\) indexing the Fibonacci sequence terms.  
- **Fibonacci Coefficients**: Coefficients of the quadratic are Fibonacci numbers \(F_k\), \(F_{k+1}\), and \(F_{k+2}\).  
- **Target Expression**: The expression to compute, \((r+1)(s+1)\).  
- **Core Concept**: Connection between symmetric functions of roots and coefficients of the quadratic, leveraging the Fibonacci recurrence \(F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}\) with base cases \(F_1 = 1\), \(F_2 = 1\).  
- **Simplicity in Original**: The original problem yields a constant value for \((r+1)(s+1)\) due to consecutive indices and cancellation.  

#### Step 2  
**#Plan#**:  
1. **Alter Coefficient Indices**: Change coefficients from consecutive shifts (\(k, k+1, k+2\)) to larger shifts (\(k, k+3, k+6\)) to disrupt cancellation.  
2. **Modify Target Expression**: Replace \((r+1)(s+1)\) with \((r - s)^2 \cdot (r s)\) to add layers of calculation and require squaring differences and products.  
3. **Introduce a Constraint**: Require the expression to be evaluated only for \(k \geq 4\) to ensure valid indices for \(F_{k+6}\) and avoid undefined Fibonacci terms.  
**Justification**:  
- Non-consecutive indices (e.g., \(F_{k+3}\), \(F_{k+6}\)) demand extended recurrence relations, increasing algebra.  
- The expression \((r - s)^2 \cdot (r s)\) specifically uses the discriminant and product, requiring more reasoning steps.  
- The constraint \(k \geq 4\) ensures feasible computation without affecting generality.

Leo flips his coin minimally \(n\) times to ensure both his expected heads exceed Susan's and \(P(\text{Leo heads} > \text{Susan heads}) \geq 0.6\). Compute \(n\).,"Step 1
#Elements Identified#:
- Variables: Fixed \(T = 10\) for Susan's flips.
- Conditions: Susan uses a fair coin (\(P(\text{heads}) = 0.5\)), Leo uses an unfair coin with fixed \(P(\text{heads}) = \frac{1}{3}\).
- Participants: Susan and Leo, each acting independently.
- Actions: Susan flips her coin \(T\) times; Leo flips his coin \(n\) times to achieve an expectation condition.
- Processes: Calculate expected number of heads; find minimal \(n\) such that Leo's expectation exceeds Susan's.
- Theme: Minimizing Leo's flips based on expected value comparison; can be made more complex by introducing randomness, dependencies, or additional constraints.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. Modify Susan's flips: Change from fixed \(T\) to a random process where Susan flips until the second tail occurs, making the number of flips (and thus her head count) follow a negative binomial distribution, requiring expectation calculation over this distribution.
2. Alter Leo's coin probability: Replace the fixed unfair probability with a decreasing probability per flip (e.g., geometrically decreasing), specifically \(P(\text{heads on } i\text{th flip}) = \frac{1}{3} \times (0.9)^{i-1}\), introducing non-identical trials and a finite geometric series for expectation.
3. Add a probabilistic constraint: Require Leo to not only exceed Susan in expectation but also ensure the probability he has strictly more heads is at least 0.6, introducing a joint probability comparison that depends on both distributions.
4. Ensure coherence: All elements interconnect?Susan's random flips affect Leo's target expectation; Leo's decreasing probability affects both expectation and the probability inequality; the probability constraint depends on both processes. Avoid introducing unnecessary variables by using concrete values like the second tail and geometric decay rate (0.9), which are justified for complexity and realism.

#Plan#:

    *   Identify the pair(s) `(k, m)` and `n` that satisfy all conditions.
5.  **Ensure Interconnection:** The bounds for `k`/`m` restrict valid `n` values derived from `n = k + m - 2`. The modular condition `n ? 2 mod 3` then filters these possible `n` values. The polygon formula constrains `k`, `m`, `n` to integers > 2.
