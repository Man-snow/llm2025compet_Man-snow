#Elements Identified#:  
- Variables: $n$ (nonnegative integer), jump lengths $(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n+1})$ (distinct positive integers), sum $s = \sum a_i$, set $M$ (size $n$ in interval $(0, s)$).  
- Participants: Grasshopper starting at 0.  
- Actions: Arranging order of jumps to avoid landing on any point in $M$.  
- Theme: Avoidance of forbidden points during a sequence of jumps on the real axis.  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
- Modify jump lengths: Fix to consecutive integers $1, 2, \ldots, n+1$ for computability, setting $s = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$.  
- Modify $M$: Define as an arithmetic sequence based on $n$ and $s$; specifically, let $d$ be the integer where the number of multiples of $d$ in $(0,s)$ is exactly $n$, making $M$ these multiples to increase complexity via uniform distribution.  
- Change task: Shift from proof to computation by requiring the number of valid jump sequences avoiding $M$, set a large $n=50$ for difficulty, and ask for the result modulo $1000000007$ to emphasize computational intensity.  
- Complexity justifications: Fixed jumps force specific $s$, arithmetic $M$ introduces regularity conflicting with jump sizes, large $n$ ensures non-trivial calculation, modulo operation adds number theory element.

This fact will be used in the proof.\n\nWe prove the statement by induction on $n$. The case $n=0$ is obvious. Let $n>0$ and let the assertion be true for all nonnegative integers less than $n$. Moreover let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n+1}, s$ and $M$ be given as in the problem. Without loss of generality we may assume that $a_{n+1}<a_{n}<$ $\\cdots<a_{2}<a_{1}$.

It suffices to show that for some $m \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n+1\\}$ the grasshopper is able to do at least $m$ jumps without landing on a point of $M$ and, in addition, after these $m$ jumps he has jumped over at least $m$ points of $M$.\n\nProof. Note that $m=n+1$ is impossible by $|M|=n$. Now set $n^{\\prime}=n-m$. Then $0 \\leq n^{\\prime}<n$. The remaining $n^{\\prime}+1$ jumps can be carried out without landing on one of the remaining at most $n^{\\prime}$ forbidden points by the induction hypothesis together with a shift of the origin. This proves the claim.\n\nAn integer $k \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n+1\\}$ is called smooth, if the grasshopper is able to do $k$ jumps with the lengths $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{k}$ in such a way that he never lands on a point of $M$ except for the very last jump, when he may land on a point of $M$.\n\nObviously, 1 is smooth. Thus there is a largest number $k^{*}$, such that all the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, k^{*}$ are smooth. If $k^{*}=n+1$, the proof is complete. In the following let $k^{*} \\leq n$.\n\nClaim 2.

2098,"For any integer $n \geq 2$, we compute the integer $h(n)$ by applying the following procedure to its decimal representation. Let $r$ be the rightmost digit of $n$.

(1) If $r=0$, then the decimal representation of $h(n)$ results from the decimal representation of $n$ by removing this rightmost digit 0 .

(2) If $1 \leq r \leq 9$ we split the decimal representation of $n$ into a maximal right part $R$ that solely consists of digits not less than $r$ and into a left part $L$ that either is empty or ends with a digit strictly smaller than $r$. Then the decimal representation of $h(n)$ consists of the decimal representation of $L$, followed by two copies of the decimal representation of $R-1$. For instance, for the number $n=17,151,345,543$, we will have $L=17,151, R=345,543$ and $h(n)=17,151,345,542,345,542$.

We recursively define ten functions $f_{0}, \\ldots, f_{9}$ that map some strings into integers for $k=$ $9,8, \\ldots, 1,0$. The function $f_{9}$ is only defined on strings $x$ (including the empty string $\\varepsilon$ ) that entirely consist of nines. If $x$ consists of $m$ nines, then $f_{9}(x)=m+1, m=0,1, \\ldots$ For $k \\leq 8$, the domain of $f_{k}(x)$ is the set of all strings consisting only of digits that are $\\geq k$. We write $x$ in the form $x_{0} k x_{1} k x_{2} k \\ldots x_{m-1} k x_{m}$ where the strings $x_{s}$ only consist of digits $\\geq k+1$. Note that some of these strings might equal the empty string $\\varepsilon$ and that $m=0$ is possible, i.e. the digit $k$ does not appear in $x$. Then we define\n\n$$\nf_{k}(x)=\\sum_{s=0}^{m} 4^{f_{k+1}\\left(x_{s}\\right)}\n$$\n\nWe will use the following obvious fact:\n\nFact 1. If $x$ does not contain digits smaller than $k$, then $f_{i}(x)=4^{f_{i+1}(x)}$ for all $i=0, \\ldots, k-1$. In particular, $f_{i}(\\varepsilon)=4^{9-i}$ for all $i=0,1, \\ldots, 9$.\n\nMoreover, by induction on $k=9,8, \\ldots, 0$ it follows easily:\n\nFact 2. If the nonempty string $x$ does not contain digits smaller than $k$, then $f_{i}(x)>f_{i}(\\varepsilon)$ for all $i=0, \\ldots, k$.\n\nWe will show the essential fact:\n\nFact 3. $f_{0}(n)>f_{0}(h(n))$.\n\nThen the empty string will necessarily be reached after a finite number of applications of $h$. But starting from a string without leading zeros, $\\varepsilon$ can only be reached via the strings $1 \\rightarrow 00 \\rightarrow 0 \\rightarrow \\varepsilon$. Hence also the number 1 will appear after a finite number of applications of $h$.\n\nProof of Fact 3. If the last digit $r$ of $n$ is 0 , then we write $n=x_{0} 0 \\ldots 0 x_{m-1} 0 \\varepsilon$ where the $x_{i}$ do not contain the digit 0 . Then $h(n)=x_{0} 0 \\ldots 0 x_{m-1}$ and $f_{0}(n)-f_{0}(h(n))=f_{0}(\\varepsilon)>0$.\n\nSo let the last digit $r$ of $n$ be at least 1. Let $L=y k$ and $R=z r$ be the corresponding left and right parts where $y$ is some string, $k \\leq r-1$ and the string $z$ consists only of digits not less\n\n\n\nthan $r$. Then $n=y k z r$ and $h(n)=y k z(r-1) z(r-1)$. Let $d(y)$ be the smallest digit of $y$.

Consequently, $f_{k}(n)-f_{k}(h(n))>0$ and according to Fact $1, f_{0}(n)-f_{0}(h(n))>0$.\n\nCase 2. $d(y) \\leq k$.\n\nWe prove by induction on $d(y)=k, k-1, \\ldots, 0$ that $f_{i}(n)-f_{i}(h(n))>0$ for all $i=0, \\ldots, d(y)$. By Fact 1, it suffices to do so for $i=d(y)$. The initialization $d(y)=k$ was already treated in Case 1. Let $t=d(y)<k$. Write $y$ in the form utv where $v$ does not contain digits $\\leq t$.

 'We identify integers $n \\geq 2$ with the digit-strings, briefly strings, of their decimal representation and extend the definition of $h$ to all non-empty strings with digits from 0 to 9.

Let $x=y z r$ where $s(y) \\geq k, s(z) \\geq k, y$ ends with the digit $k$ and $z$ is possibly empty. If $y$ and $z r$ terminate then also $x$ terminates.\n\nProof of Lemma 3. Suppose that $y$ and $z r$ terminate. We proceed by induction on $k$. Let $k=0$. Obviously, $h(y w)=y h(w)$ for any non-empty string $w$. Let $h^{n}(z r)=\\epsilon$. It follows easily by induction on $m$ that $h^{m}(y z r)=y h^{m}(z r)$ for $m=1, \\ldots, n$. Consequently, $h^{n}(y z r)=y$. Since $y$ terminates, also $x=y z r$ terminates.\n\nNow let the assertion be true for all nonnegative integers less than $k$ and let us prove it for $k$ where $k \\geq 1$. It turns out that it is sufficient to prove that $y g_{k}(h(z r))$ terminates. Indeed:\n\nCase 1. $r=0$.\n\nThen $h(y z r)=y z=y g_{k}(h(z r))$.\n\nCase 2. $0<r \\leq k$.\n\nWe have $h(z r)=z(r-1) z(r-1)$ and $g_{k}(h(z r))=z(r-1)$. Then $h(y z r)=y z(r-1) y z(r-1)=y g_{k}(h(z r)) y g_{k}(h(z r))$ and we may apply the induction hypothesis to see that if $\\left.y g_{k} h(z r)\\right)$ terminates, then $h(y z r)$ terminates.\n\nCase 3. $r>k$.\n\nThen $h(y z r)=y h(z r)=y g_{k}(h(z r))$.\n\nNote that $y g_{k}(h(z r))$ has the form $y z^{\\prime} r^{\\prime}$ where $s\\left(z^{\\prime}\\right) \\geq k$. By the same arguments it is sufficient to prove that $y g_{k}\\left(h\\left(z^{\\prime} r^{\\prime}\\right)\\right)=y\\left(g_{k} \\circ h\\right)^{2}(z r)$ terminates and, by induction, that $y\\left(g_{k} \\circ h\\right)^{m}(z r)$ terminates for some positive integer $m$. In view of Lemma 2 there is some $m$ such that $\\left(g_{k} \\circ\\right.$ $h)^{m}(z r)=\\epsilon$, so $x=y z r$ terminates if $y$ terminates. Thus Lemma 3 is proved.\n\nNow assume that there is some string $x$ that does not terminate. We choose $x$ minimal. If $x \\geq 10$, we can write $x$ in the form $x=y z r$ of Lemma 3 and by this lemma $x$ terminates since $y$ and $z r$ are smaller than $x$. If $x \\leq 9$, then $h(x)=(x-1)(x-1)$ and $h(x)$ terminates again by Lemma 3 and the minimal choice of $x$.'

If $\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right)$ is a nonempty string, we let $\\rho(a)=a_{n}$ denote the terminal digit of $a$ and $\\lambda(a)$ be the string with the last digit removed. We also define $\\lambda(\\epsilon)=\\epsilon$ and denote the set of non-negative integers by $\\mathbb{N}_{0}$.\n\nNow let $k \\in\\{0,1,2, \\ldots, 9\\}$ denote any digit. We define a function $f_{k}: S \\longrightarrow S$ on the set of strings: First, if the terminal digit of $n$ belongs to $\\{0,1, \\ldots, k\\}$, then $f_{k}(n)$ is obtained from $n$ by deleting this terminal digit, i.e $f_{k}(n)=\\lambda(n)$. Secondly, if the terminal digit of $n$ belongs to $\\{k+1, \\ldots, 9\\}$, then $f_{k}(n)$ is obtained from $n$ by the process described in the problem. We also define $f_{k}(\\epsilon)=\\epsilon$. Note that up to the definition for integers $n \\leq 1$, the function $f_{0}$ coincides with the function $h$ in the problem, through interpreting integers as digit strings. The argument will be roughly as follows. We begin by introducing a straightforward generalization of our claim about $f_{0}$. Then it will be easy to see that $f_{9}$ has all these stronger properties, which means that is suffices to show for $k \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, 8\\}$ that $f_{k}$ possesses these properties provided that $f_{k+1}$ does.\n\nWe continue to use $k$ to denote any digit. The operation $f_{k}$ is said to be separating, if the followings holds: Whenever $a$ is an initial segment of $b$, there is some $N \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$ such that $f_{k}^{N}(b)=a$. The following two notions only apply to the case where $f_{k}$ is indeed separating, otherwise they remain undefined. For every $a \\in S$ we denote the least $N \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$ for which $f_{k}^{N}(a)=\\epsilon$ occurs by $g_{k}(a)$ (because $\\epsilon$ is an initial segment of $a$, such an $N$ exists if $f_{k}$ is separating). If for every two strings $a$ and $b$ such that $a$ is a terminal segment of $b$ one has $g_{k}(a) \\leq g_{k}(b)$, we say that $f_{k}$ is coherent. In case that $f_{k}$ is separating and coherent we call the digit $k$ seductive.\n\nAs $f_{9}(a)=\\lambda(a)$ for all $a$, it is obvious that 9 is seductive. Hence in order to show that 0 is seductive, which clearly implies the statement of the problem, it suffices to take any $k \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, 8\\}$ such that $k+1$ is seductive and to prove that $k$ has to be seductive as well. Note that in doing so, we have the function $g_{k+1}$ at our disposal. We have to establish two things and we begin with\n\nStep 1. $f_{k}$ is separating.\n\nBefore embarking on the proof of this, we record a useful observation which is easily proved by induction on $M$.\n\n\n\nClaim 1. For any strings $A, B$ and any positive integer $M$ such that $f_{k}^{M-1}(B) \\neq \\epsilon$, we have\n\n$$\nf_{k}^{M}(A k B)=A k f_{k}^{M}(B)\n$$\n\nNow we call a pair $(a, b)$ of strings wicked provided that $a$ is an initial segment of $b$, but there is no $N \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$ such that $f_{k}^{N}(b)=a$. We need to show that there are none, so assume that there were such pairs. Choose a wicked pair $(a, b)$ for which $g_{k+1}(b)$ attains its minimal possible value. Obviously $b \\neq \\epsilon$ for any wicked pair $(a, b)$. Let $z$ denote the terminal digit of $b$. Observe that $a \\neq b$, which means that $a$ is also an initial segment of $\\lambda(b)$. To facilitate the construction of the eventual contradiction, we prove\n\nClaim 2. There cannot be an $N \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$ such that\n\n$$\nf_{k}^{N}(b)=\\lambda(b)\n$$\n\nProof of Claim 2. For suppose that such an $N$ existed. Because $g_{k+1}(\\lambda(b))<g_{k+1}(b)$ in view of the coherency of $f_{k+1}$, the pair $(a, \\lambda(b))$ is not wicked. But then there is some $N^{\\prime}$ for which $f_{k}^{N^{\\prime}}(\\lambda(b))=a$ which entails $f_{k}^{N+N^{\\prime}}(b)=a$, contradiction. Hence Claim 2 is proved.\n\nIt follows that $z \\leq k$ is impossible, for otherwise $N=1$ violated Claim 2.\n\nAlso $z>k+1$ is impossible: Set $B=f_{k}(b)$. Then also $f_{k+1}(b)=B$, but $g_{k+1}(B)<g_{k+1}(b)$ and $a$ is an initial segment of $B$. Thus the pair $(a, B)$ is not wicked. Hence there is some $N \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$ with $a=f_{k}^{N}(B)$, which, however, entails $a=f_{k}^{N+1}(b)$.\n\nWe are left with the case $z=k+1$. Let $L$ denote the left part and $R=R^{*}(k+1)$ the right part of $b$. Then we have symbolically\n\n$$\nf_{k}(b)=L R^{*} k R^{*} k, f_{k}^{2}(b)=L R^{*} k R^{*} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad f_{k+1}(b)=L R^{*}\n$$\n\nUsing that $R^{*}$ is a terminal segment of $L R^{*}$ and the coherency of $f_{k+1}$, we infer\n\n$$\ng_{k+1}\\left(R^{*}\\right) \\leq g_{k+1}\\left(L R^{*}\\right)<g_{k+1}(b) .\n$$\n\nHence the pair $\\left(\\epsilon, R^{*}\\right)$ is not wicked, so there is some minimal $M \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$ with $f_{k}^{M}\\left(R^{*}\\right)=\\epsilon$ and by Claim 1 it follows that $f_{k}^{2+M}(b)=L R^{*} k$. Finally, we infer that $\\lambda(b)=L R^{*}=f_{k}\\left(L R^{*} k\\right)=$ $f_{k}^{3+M}(b)$, which yields a contradiction to Claim 2 .\n\nThis final contradiction establishes that $f_{k}$ is indeed separating.\n\nStep 2. $f_{k}$ is coherent.\n\nTo prepare the proof of this, we introduce some further pieces of terminology. A nonempty string $\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right)$ is called a hypostasis, if $a_{n}<a_{i}$ for all $i=1, \\ldots, n-1$. Reading an arbitrary string $a$ backwards, we easily find a, possibly empty, sequence $\\left(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{m}\\right)$ of hypostases such that $\\rho\\left(A_{1}\\right) \\leq \\rho\\left(A_{2}\\right) \\leq \\cdots \\leq \\rho\\left(A_{m}\\right)$ and, symbolically, $a=A_{1} A_{2} \\ldots A_{m}$. The latter sequence is referred to as the decomposition of $a$. So, for instance, $(20,0,9)$ is the decomposition of 2009 and the string 50 is a hypostasis. Next we explain when we say about two strings $a$ and $b$ that $a$ is injectible into $b$. The definition is by induction on the length of $b$. Let $\\left(B_{1}, B_{2}, \\ldots, B_{n}\\right)$ be the decomposition of $b$ into hypostases. Then $a$ is injectible into $b$ if for the decomposition $\\left(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{m}\\right)$ of $a$ there is a strictly increasing function $H:\\{1,2, \\ldots, m\\} \\longrightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ satisfying\n\n$$\n\\rho\\left(A_{i}\\right)=\\rho\\left(B_{H(i)}\\right) \\text { for all } i=1, \\ldots, m \\text {; }\n$$\n\n\n\n$\\lambda\\left(A_{i}\\right)$ is injectible into $\\lambda\\left(B_{H(i)}\\right)$ for all $i=1, \\ldots, m$.\n\nIf one can choose $H$ with $H(m)=n$, then we say that $a$ is strongly injectible into $b$. Obviously, if $a$ is a terminal segment of $b$, then $a$ is strongly injectible into $b$.\n\nClaim 3. If $a$ and $b$ are two nonempty strings such that $a$ is strongly injectible into $b$, then $\\lambda(a)$ is injectible into $\\lambda(b)$.\n\nProof of Claim 3. Let $\\left(B_{1}, B_{2}, \\ldots, B_{n}\\right)$ be the decomposition of $b$ and let $\\left(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{m}\\right)$ be the decomposition of $a$. Take a function $H$ exemplifying that $a$ is strongly injectible into $b$. Let $\\left(C_{1}, C_{2}, \\ldots, C_{r}\\right)$ be the decomposition of $\\lambda\\left(A_{m}\\right)$ and let $\\left(D_{1}, D_{2}, \\ldots, D_{s}\\right)$ be the decomposition of $\\lambda\\left(B_{n}\\right)$. Choose a strictly increasing $H^{\\prime}:\\{1,2, \\ldots, r\\} \\longrightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots s\\}$ witnessing that $\\lambda\\left(A_{m}\\right)$ is injectible into $\\lambda\\left(B_{n}\\right)$. Clearly, $\\left(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{m-1}, C_{1}, C_{2}, \\ldots, C_{r}\\right)$ is the decomposition of $\\lambda(a)$ and $\\left(B_{1}, B_{2}, \\ldots, B_{n-1}, D_{1}, D_{2}, \\ldots, D_{s}\\right)$ is the decomposition of $\\lambda(b)$. Then the function $H^{\\prime \\prime}:\\{1,2, \\ldots, m+r-1\\} \\longrightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, n+s-1\\}$ given by $H^{\\prime \\prime}(i)=H(i)$ for $i=1,2, \\ldots, m-1$ and $H^{\\prime \\prime}(m-1+i)=n-1+H^{\\prime}(i)$ for $i=1,2, \\ldots, r$ exemplifies that $\\lambda(a)$ is injectible into $\\lambda(b)$, which finishes the proof of the claim.\n\nA pair $(a, b)$ of strings is called aggressive if $a$ is injectible into $b$ and nevertheless $g_{k}(a)>g_{k}(b)$. Observe that if $f_{k}$ was incoherent, which we shall assume from now on, then such pairs existed. Now among all aggressive pairs we choose one, say $(a, b)$, for which $g_{k}(b)$ attains its least possible value. Obviously $f_{k}(a)$ cannot be injectible into $f_{k}(b)$, for otherwise the pair $\\left(f_{k}(a), f_{k}(b)\\right)$ was aggressive and contradicted our choice of $(a, b)$. Let $\\left(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{m}\\right)$ and $\\left(B_{1}, B_{2}, \\ldots, B_{n}\\right)$ be the decompositions of $a$ and $b$ and take a function $H:\\{1,2, \\ldots, m\\} \\longrightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ exemplifying that $a$ is indeed injectible into $b$. If we had $H(m)<n$, then $a$ was also injectible into the number $b^{\\prime}$ whose decomposition is $\\left(B_{1}, B_{2}, \\ldots, B_{n-1}\\right)$ and by separativity of $f_{k}$ we obtained $g_{k}\\left(b^{\\prime}\\right)<g_{k}(b)$, whence the pair $\\left(a, b^{\\prime}\\right)$ was also aggressive, contrary to the minimality condition imposed on $b$. Therefore $a$ is strongly injectible into $b$. In particular, $a$ and $b$ have a common terminal digit, say $z$. If we had $z \\leq k$, then $f_{k}(a)=\\lambda(a)$ and $f_{k}(b)=\\lambda(b)$, so that by Claim $3, f_{k}(a)$ was injectible into $f_{k}(b)$, which is a contradiction. Hence, $z \\geq k+1$.\n\nNow let $r$ be the minimal element of $\\{1,2, \\ldots, m\\}$ for which $\\rho\\left(A_{r}\\right)=z$. Then the maximal right part of $a$ consisting of digits $\\geq z$ is equal to $R_{a}$, the string whose decomposition is $\\left(A_{r}, A_{r+1}, \\ldots, A_{m}\\right)$. Then $R_{a}-1$ is a hypostasis and $\\left(A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{r-1}, R_{a}-1, R_{a}-1\\right)$ is the decomposition of $f_{k}(a)$. Defining $s$ and $R_{b}$ in a similar fashion with respect to $b$, we see that $\\left(B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{s-1}, R_{b}-1, R_{b}-1\\right)$ is the decomposition of $f_{k}(b)$. The definition of injectibility then easily entails that $R_{a}$ is strongly injectible into $R_{b}$. It follows from Claim 3 that $\\lambda\\left(R_{a}\\right)=$ $\\lambda\\left(R_{a}-1\\right)$ is injectible into $\\lambda\\left(R_{b}\\right)=\\lambda\\left(R_{b}-1\\right)$, whence the function $H^{\\prime}:\\{1,2, \\ldots, r+1\\} \\longrightarrow$ $\\{1,2, \\ldots, s+1\\}$, given by $H^{\\prime}(i)=H(i)$ for $i=1,2, \\ldots, r-1, H^{\\prime}(r)=s$ and $H^{\\prime}(r+1)=s+1$ exemplifies that $f_{k}(a)$ is injectible into $f_{k}(b)$, which yields a contradiction as before.\n\nThis shows that aggressive pairs cannot exist, whence $f_{k}$ is indeed coherent, which finishes the proof of the seductivity of $k$, whereby the problem is finally solved.']"

**Step 2**  
#Plan#:  
1. Concretize the triangle by specifying side lengths (AB = 13, BC = 14, CA = 15) to enable numerical computation. This removes generality and requires solving for specific values.  
2. Fix point P with CP = 4 to eliminate one degree of freedom, forcing computation for a defined position. This adds a real-world constraint and sets the stage for a unique solution.  
3. Transform the implication into a computational goal by requiring finding Q such that k is tangent to PQ, then computing the distance OQ. This shifts from proof to calculation, leveraging tangency to derive a numerical answer, which relies on circumradius and coordinate-based methods for complexity.  
4. Maintain logical connections: P fixed on CA, circle k depends on midpoints derived from P and Q, tangency condition determines a specific Q, and OQ is computed using circumcenter O. The use of non-trivial side lengths (13-14-15 scalene triangle) ensures messy coordinate work, increasing difficulty.

This contradicts the hypothesis that $A D$ and $B C$ intersect. Since $E, F, G$ fulfill (1), it is the equation of a line which completes the proof of the lemma.\n\nNow consider the parallelograms $E A X B$ and $E C Y D$ (see Figure 1). Then $G, H$ are the midpoints of $E X, E Y$, respectively. Let $M$ be the midpoint of $E F$. By applying the Lemma to the (re-entrant) quadrilateral $A D B C$, it is evident that $G, H$, and $M$ are collinear. A dilation by a factor of 2 with center $E$ shows that $X, Y, F$ are collinear. Since $A X \\| D E$ and $B X \\| C E$, we have pairwise equal interior angles in the quadrilaterals $F D E C$ and $F B X A$. Since we have also $\\angle E B A=\\angle D C A=\\angle C D Y$, the quadrilaterals are similar.

#Plan#:
1.  **Introduce Parameters:** Place the figure in the coordinate plane to enable computation. Define positions using specific angles to create variable dependencies. Assign coordinates: Place P at origin (0,0). Let AB be defined by line(s) making angle α with positive x-axis. Let DC be defined by line(s) making angle β with positive x-axis. Introduce a scaling parameter k such that point C/C/D is determined by dividing a segment in ratio k:1 (e.g., let PC/PD = k or similar). This concretizes positions without trivializing and introduces parametric dependency.
2.  **Replace Concurrency Proof with Metric Calculation:** Instead of proving concurrency, task will be to compute a specific metric derived from the lines (perpendiculars and H1H2). Calculate the distance between the point where the perp from E1 to CD meets the perp from E2 to AB and the line H1H2. This distance involves calculating coordinates of O₁, H₁, E₁, O₂, H₂, E₂, finding foots of perpendiculars (from E1 to CD, E2 to AB), the equations of the perpendiculars and H1H2, and calculating the point-line distance.
3.  **Add Optimization Constraint:** The problem requires calculating a specific value. Combine the parametric dependencies introduced in step 1 and the distance metric from step 2. Require finding the *minimum possible value* of this distance subject to the constraint that the defining angles α and β satisfy a geometric condition intrinsic to the quadrilateral's non-parallelism (e.g., α ≠ β) and an explicit constraint |α - β| = γ (a fixed small angle) or find it for specific α, β, k and then generalize the problem to the minimization over k. This adds complexity via minimization under constraint, leveraging parametrization.
4.  **Replace `Prove` with `Compute`:** Directly state the computational goals: symbolically determine the distance expression with specific k and angles and then find its minimum over k under an angle constraint.
5.  **Integrate Elements:** Ensure the introduced parameters (α, β, k) affect triangle definitions and hence O₁, H₁, O₂, H₂, E₁, E₂, impacting both the perpendiculars and H1H2, making the distance a function of these parameters.

4. **Add implicit constraints**: Path length computation requires understanding vertex out-degrees/gcd properties and connectivity modulo \(n\), increasing reasoning.  
5. **Ensure theme consistency**: Retain the graph definition and divisibility rule; focus shifts to computational hardness.

#Plan#:
1.  **Shift Focus from All n to Specific Count:** Instead of requiring P(n) to be balanced for *every* n, make it a computational question about the number of n where P(n) *is* balanced *even when a ≠ b*. The challenge is that when a ≠ b, P(n) is mostly unbalanced, so finding the exact count is non-trivial.
2.  **Concretize and Differentiate a and b:** Establish a specific, non-zero difference between a and b (|a - b| = k) and make k a parameter. This ensures a ≠ b.
3.  **Increase Computational Scope:** Define a large target range where this count happens (e.g., n ≤ M) and set M to a large constant (like 10^6).
4.  **Require Explicit Computation:** The final instruction must ask for the computation of a specific numerical value (the count) based on the concrete values.
5.  **Add Constraint and Complication:** Force a and b to be distinct using the difference parameter, preserving the core polynomial structure and balanced definition. Replace proof logic with the need for analytical number theory tools or algebraic characterization to compute the sparse count efficiently.
6.  **Integrate:** Combine distinct a and b (|a-b|=5), the large range (n ≤ 10⁶), P(x)=(x+a)(x+b) defined normally, the balanced number definition unchanged, and the request for the count of n where P(n) is balanced. This transforms the proof into a non-trivial counting problem requiring sieve methods or complex multiplicative function analysis over the range, avoiding brute force.

#Elements Identified#:  
- **Variables**: \(a\) and \(b\), distinct integers greater than 1.  
- **Action**: Prove the existence of a positive integer \(n\) such as \(\left(a^{n}-1\right)\left(b^{n}-1\right)\) is not a perfect square.  
- **Key condition**: Integers distinct and greater than 1, with focus on properties related to perfect squares and exponential terms.  
- **Theme**: Number theory, specifically divisibility, exponential functions, and properties of perfect squares.  

**Step 2**  
#Plan#:  
- **Add a variable**: Introduce a third distinct integer \(c\) greater than 1 to increase dimensionality and combinatorial complexity.  
- **Concretize variables**: Restrict \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to distinct prime numbers greater than 2 to impose primality constraints, ensuring a specific structure and avoiding trivial cases.  
- **Add real-world/complexity constraint**: Require that the initial product \((a-1)(b-1)(c-1)\) is a perfect square (so \(n=1\) is a solution for the square property), making the failure occur at higher \(n\) and necessiting deeper analysis with exponential growth.  
- **Change action**: Shift from an existence proof to a computational task: find the minimal \(n > 1\) such that the product \((a^n-1)(b^n-1)(c^n-1)\) is not a perfect square, requiring numerical computation.  
- **Interconnections**: The primality constraint links to number theory concepts (e.g., prime properties), the square condition for \(n=1\) creates a setup for failure points, and the product with three exponentials increases multiplicative complexity and computational difficulty.  
- **Complexity justification**: Adding a variable scales exponential growth; primality ensures non-trivial factorization at high \(n\); the initial square condition forces \(n>1\) to be searched, demanding optimization or algorithmic solutions for large or specific cases.

#Elements Identified#:
*   **Core Concept:** Defining a recursive function `f` on integers using values mod 3 (`t(m)`) and a specific recurrence relation based on powers of 2.
*   **Core Structure:**
    *   Domain/Codomain: `f: Z -> Z`
    *   Base Cases: `f(-1)=0`, `f(0)=1`, `f(1)=-1`
    *   Auxiliary Function: `t(m)` = `{1,2,3} ∩ (3ℤ - m)`.
    *   Recurrence: `f(2ⁿ + m) = f(2ⁿ - t(m)) - f(m)` for `n ≥ 0`, `m ≥ 0`, `2ⁿ > m`.
    *   Conclusion (Original): Prove `f(3p) ≥ 0` for all `p ≥ 0`.
*   **Manipulatable Elements:** Base values, recurrence scope/conditions, `t(m)` definition, the inequality target (`f(3p) ≥ 0`). Can introduce computation targets (sums, products, min/max), constraints on the indices involved (`n`, `m`, `p`), connect to sequence counting/values.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Change Conclusion Type:** Replace the proof of non-negativity (`f(3p) ≥ 0`) with a specific computation involving `f(3p)` values. Specifically, calculate the minimum value of `f(3p)` *over a specific subset of these indices*, transforming it into a minimization problem.
2.  **Increase Index Complexity:** Instead of proving for all `p`, focus computation on indices `3p` where `p` itself is a multiple of 3 *and* satisfies an additional, practically computable, yet non-trivial condition. Choose `p = 2ᵏ` (i.e., compute for arguments of the form `3 * 2ᵏ`). This leverages the recurrence's structure explicitly.
3.  **Require Multi-step Computation:** Compute a specific value related to these indices. Choose to compute the sum `Σ` of `f(3 * 2ᵏ)` for `0 <= k <= K`, forcing multiple applications of the recurrence for each `k`. Ensure `K` is chosen large enough (`K=10`) to necessitate substantive calculation without being intractable.
4.  **Embed Relationship:** To increase interdependence, include `f(2ᵏ)` in the expression to be summed. This ties the calculation directly to the recurrence's action on pure powers of 2, adding layers.
5.  **Increase Difficulty Further:** Require the minimum value of this new expression derived from multiple `f(3 * 2ᵏ)` and `f(2ᵏ)` (`min_k` of `f(3 * 2ᵏ) + f(2ᵏ)` for `0 <= k <= K`) instead of just the sum or a single value. This necessitates computing all values first and then finding the min.
6.  **Maintain Original Framework:** Keep all definitions (`t(m)`, recurrence, base cases) unchanged. Ensure the indices used (`n`, `m` in recurrence calculations for arguments up to `3 * 2¹⁰ = 3072`) satisfy the recurrence condition `2ⁿ > m`.

#Elements Identified#:  
- **Function**: $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ (maps reals to positive integers).  
- **Core Equation**: $f\left(x + \frac{1}{f(y)}\right) = f\left(y + \frac{1}{f(x)}\right)$ for all $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$.  
- **Theme**: Properties of $f$.  
- **Proof Goal**: Existence of a positive integer not in the range of $f$.  
- **Manipulable Elements**: Domain/scope of $f$, parameters in the equation, additional constraints on $f$, introduction of specific values or sequences, computational output demand.  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
1. **Generalize the Primary Equation**: Modify the constants 1 to integer parameters $(a, b) \in \mathbb{Z}^2$ and fix them to specific non-unit values, reducing symmetry and allowing non-trivial analysis.  
2. **Constrain the Domain and Initial Value**: Restrict $x, y$ to integers $\mathbb{Z}$, not $\mathbb{R}$. Demand an initial condition $f(0) = c_0$ for a known $c_0$.  
3. **Require Specific Sequence Computation**: Define an integer sequence $\{c_n\}$ using the equation, starting from $c_0$, and ask for a specific term $c_k$ with large $k$. The sequence is defined recursively by setting $y = 0$ and $x$ based on prior terms.  
4. **Ensure Computational Hardness**: Set $a = 2$, $b = 3$, $c_0 = 1$, and $k = 100$. Solving requires extensive iteration of the sequence and checking consistency, making calculation laborious.  
5. **Maintain Theme**: Focus on growth and values of $f$ under iterative applications of the equation.

Compute $c_{100}$.",success,131.31,"['Suppose that the statement is false and $f(\\mathbb{R})=\\mathbb{N}$. We prove several properties of the function $f$ in order to reach a contradiction.\n\nTo start with, observe that one can assume $f(0)=1$. Indeed, let $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$ be such that $f(a)=1$, and consider the function $g(x)=f(x+a)$. By substituting $x+a$ and $y+a$ for $x$ and $y$ in (1), we have\n\n$$\ng\\left(x+\\frac{1}{g(y)}\\right)=f\\left(x+a+\\frac{1}{f(y+a)}\\right)=f\\left(y+a+\\frac{1}{f(x+a)}\\right)=g\\left(y+\\frac{1}{g(x)}\\right) .\n$$\n\nSo $g$ satisfies the functional equation (1), with the additional property $g(0)=1$. Also, $g$ and $f$ have the same set of values: $g(\\mathbb{R})=f(\\mathbb{R})=\\mathbb{N}$. Henceforth we assume $f(0)=1$.\n\nClaim 1. For an arbitrary fixed $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$ we have $\\left\\{f\\left(c+\\frac{1}{n}\\right): n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\right\\}=\\mathbb{N}$.\n\nProof. Equation (1) and $f(\\mathbb{R})=\\mathbb{N}$ imply\n\n$f(\\mathbb{R})=\\left\\{f\\left(x+\\frac{1}{f(c)}\\right): x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\right\\}=\\left\\{f\\left(c+\\frac{1}{f(x)}\\right): x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\right\\} \\subset\\left\\{f\\left(c+\\frac{1}{n}\\right): n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\right\\} \\subset f(\\mathbb{R})$.\n\nThe claim follows.\n\nWe will use Claim 1 in the special cases $c=0$ and $c=1 / 3$ :\n\n$$\n\\left\\{f\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right): n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\right\\}=\\left\\{f\\left(\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{1}{n}\\right): n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\right\\}=\\mathbb{N}\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nClaim 2. If $f(u)=f(v)$ for some $u, v \\in \\mathbb{R}$ then $f(u+q)=f(v+q)$ for all nonnegative rational $q$. Furthermore, if $f(q)=1$ for some nonnegative rational $q$ then $f(k q)=1$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nProof. For all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ we have by (1)\n\n$$\nf\\left(u+\\frac{1}{f(x)}\\right)=f\\left(x+\\frac{1}{f(u)}\\right)=f\\left(x+\\frac{1}{f(v)}\\right)=f\\left(v+\\frac{1}{f(x)}\\right) .\n$$\n\nSince $f(x)$ attains all positive integer values, this yields $f(u+1 / n)=f(v+1 / n)$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Let $q=k / n$ be a positive rational number. Then $k$ repetitions of the last step yield\n\n$$\nf(u+q)=f\\left(u+\\frac{k}{n}\\right)=f\\left(v+\\frac{k}{n}\\right)=f(v+q)\n$$\n\nNow let $f(q)=1$ for some nonnegative rational $q$, and let $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. As $f(0)=1$, the previous conclusion yields successively $f(q)=f(2 q), f(2 q)=f(3 q), \\ldots, f((k-1) q)=f(k q)$, as needed.\n\nClaim 3. The equality $f(q)=f(q+1)$ holds for all nonnegative rational $q$.\n\nProof. Let $m$ be a positive integer such that $f(1 / m)=1$. Such an $m$ exists by (2). Applying the second statement of Claim 2 with $q=1 / m$ and $k=m$ yields $f(1)=1$.\n\nGiven that $f(0)=f(1)=1$, the first statement of Claim 2 implies $f(q)=f(q+1)$ for all nonnegative rational $q$.\n\n\n\nClaim 4. The equality $f\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)=n$ holds for every $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nProof. For a nonnegative rational $q$ we set $x=q, y=0$ in (1) and use Claim 3 to obtain\n\n$$\nf\\left(\\frac{1}{f(q)}\\right)=f\\left(q+\\frac{1}{f(0)}\\right)=f(q+1)=f(q)\n$$\n\nBy (2), for each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ there exists a $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $f(1 / k)=n$. Applying the last equation with $q=1 / k$, we have\n\n$$\nn=f\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{1}{f(1 / k)}\\right)=f\\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow we are ready to obtain a contradiction. Let $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ be such that $f(1 / 3+1 / n)=1$. Such an $n$ exists by (2). Let $1 / 3+1 / n=s / t$, where $s, t \\in \\mathbb{N}$ are coprime. Observe that $t>1$ as $1 / 3+1 / n$ is not an integer. Choose $k, l \\in \\mathbb{N}$ so that that $k s-l t=1$.\n\nBecause $f(0)=f(s / t)=1$, Claim 2 implies $f(k s / t)=1$. Now $f(k s / t)=f(1 / t+l)$; on the other hand $f(1 / t+l)=f(1 / t)$ by $l$ successive applications of Claim 3 . Finally, $f(1 / t)=t$ by Claim 4, leading to the impossible $t=1$. The solution is complete.']"

Step 2
**#Plan#:**
1.  **Increase Dimensionality:** Replace 4 fixed variables with `n` variables (`x_1, x_2, ..., x_n`), where `n` is sufficiently large (e.g., 10), making brute-force computation impractical.
2.  **Introduce Parameterized Values:** Define each variable `x_k` as a complex transformation or perturbation (e.g., `x_k = cos(θ_k) + e^(-k α)` for `k=1..n`) to break symmetry, introduce irrational dependencies, and require parameter handling. Parameters (`θ_k`, `α`) will be constrained to specific intervals (e.g., `θ_k ∈ [0, π/2]`, `α > 0`).
3.  **Shift Task to Computation & Constraint:** Instead of proving non-negativity for all inputs, require the computation of the *minimum* value of the full cyclic sum over `n` variables (based on the given expression pattern) under a non-trivial constraint (e.g., fixed arithmetic mean of the `x_i`). Explicitly state `n=10`.
4.  **Increase Equality Difficulty:** Replace ""determine all cases"" with computing the minimum value *and* the number of indices `k` satisfying a specific modular relation (e.g., `k ≡ 0 mod 3`) when the minimum is achieved (linking equality structure to the `n` variables).
5.  **Maintain Core Structure:** Generalize the expression pattern: Sum over `k` of `[ (x_k - x_{k+1})(x_k - x_{k+2}) ] / [ x_k + x_{k+1} + x_{k+2} ]` modulo `n`. Ensure positivity condition (`x_i > 0`).

This means that\n\n$$\na_{n}=1 \\quad \\text { or } \\quad a_{n}=\\frac{n+1}{2} \\quad \\text { or } \\quad a_{n}=n \\text {. }\n$$\n\nSuppose that $a_{n}=(n+1) / 2$. Since the permutation is nice, taking $k=n-2$ we get that $n-2$ has to be a divisor of\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n2\\left(a_{1}+a_{2}+\\cdots+a_{n-2}\\right) & =2\\left((1+2+\\cdots+n)-a_{n}-a_{n-1}\\right) \\\\\n& =n(n+1)-(n+1)-2 a_{n-1}=(n+2)(n-2)+\\left(3-2 a_{n-1}\\right) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSo $2 a_{n-1}-3$ should be divisible by $n-2$, hence equal to 0 or $n-2$ or $2 n-4$. Obviously 0 and $2 n-4$ are excluded because $2 a_{n-1}-3$ is odd. The remaining possibility $\\left(2 a_{n-1}-3=n-2\\right)$ leads to $a_{n-1}=(n+1) / 2=a_{n}$, which also cannot hold. This eliminates $(n+1) / 2$ as a possible value of $a_{n}$. Consequently $a_{n}=1$ or $a_{n}=n$.\n\nIf $a_{n}=n$ then $\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n-1}\\right)$ is a nice permutation of $\\{1,2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$. There are $F_{n-1}$ such permutations. Attaching $n$ to any one of them at the end creates a nice permutation of $\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$.\n\nIf $a_{n}=1$ then $\\left(a_{1}-1, a_{2}-1, \\ldots, a_{n-1}-1\\right)$ is a permutation of $\\{1,2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$. It is also nice because the number\n\n$$\n2\\left(\\left(a_{1}-1\\right)+\\cdots+\\left(a_{k}-1\\right)\\right)=2\\left(a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{k}\\right)-2 k\n$$\n\nis divisible by $k$, for any $k \\leq n-1$. And again, any one of the $F_{n-1}$ nice permutations $\\left(b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n-1}\\right)$ of $\\{1,2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$ gives rise to a nice permutation of $\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ whose last term is 1 , namely $\\left(b_{1}+1, b_{2}+1, \\ldots, b_{n-1}+1,1\\right)$.\n\nThe bijective correspondences established in both cases show that there are $F_{n-1}$ nice permutations of $\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ with the last term 1 and also $F_{n-1}$ nice permutations of $\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ with the last term $n$. Hence follows the recurrence $F_{n}=2 F_{n-1}$. With the base value $F_{3}=6$ this gives the outcome formula $F_{n}=3 \\cdot 2^{n-2}$ for $n \\geq 3$.']"

#Elements Identified#:  
- **Variables and Sets**: $S$ is a $(k+\ell)$-element set of real numbers in $[0,1]$; $k$ and $\ell$ are positive integers.  
- **Nice Subset Condition**: A $k$-element subset $A$ is nice if the absolute difference between the average of $A$ and the average of $S \setminus A$ is at most $\frac{k+\ell}{2k\ell}$.  
- **Objective**: Prove a lower bound on the number of nice subsets, specifically $\frac{2}{k+\ell} \binom{k+\ell}{k}$.  
- **Theme**: Combinatorial inequality involving averages and subset sums, relying on the structure of $S$ in $[0,1]$.  
- **Actions/Processes**: Proving the existence of a lower bound through combinatorial reasoning, without specific computation of $S$.  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
1. **Modify the set $S$**: Replace the arbitrary set with a specific, non-uniform sequence to complicate average calculation. Define $S = \left\{ \sqrt{\frac{i}{n}} \mid i = 1, 2, \ldots, n \right\}$ where $n = k + \ell$, introducing irrational values and asymmetry.  
2. **Modify $k$ and $\ell$**: Fix $n$ and set asymmetric values $k = \lfloor n/3 \rfloor$ and $\ell = n - k$ to disrupt symmetry, choosing $n = 60$ for computational infeasibility via enumeration.  
3. **Alter the output action**: Instead of proving a lower bound, compute the exact number of nice subsets for the given $S$ and parameters, requiring a specific numeric answer derived from combinatorial methods.  
4. **Add dependency and complexity**: The $\sqrt{\cdot}$ function creates non-linear spacing, making subs    et sums difficult. The choices of $n = 60$ and $k = 20,\ell = 40$ ensure that $\binom{60}{20}$ is large ($\approx 4.2 \times 10^{15}$), forcing advanced techniques like generating functions or inclusion–exclusion.  
5. **Ensure interconnectedness**: All elements remain tied; $S$ depends on $n$, $k$ and $\ell$ depend on $n$, and the nice condition depends on the averages of $S$-based sums.

Hence in $k$ of the expressions $f\\left(A_{1}\\right), \\ldots, f\\left(A_{k+\\ell}\\right)$ the coefficient of $y_{i}$ is $1 / k$; in the remaining $\\ell$ expressions, its coefficient is $-1 / \\ell$. So the contribution of $y_{i}$ to the sum of all $f\\left(A_{i}\\right)$ equals $k \\cdot 1 / k-\\ell \\cdot 1 / \\ell=0$. Since this holds for all $i$, it follows that $f\\left(A_{1}\\right)+\\cdots+f\\left(A_{k+\\ell}\\right)=0$.\n\nIf $f\\left(A_{p}\\right)=\\min f\\left(A_{i}\\right), f\\left(A_{q}\\right)=\\max f\\left(A_{i}\\right)$, we obtain in particular $f\\left(A_{p}\\right) \\leq 0, f\\left(A_{q}\\right) \\geq 0$. Let $p<q$ (the case $p>q$ is analogous; and the claim is true for $p=q$ as $f\\left(A_{i}\\right)=0$ for all $i$ ).\n\nWe are ready to prove that at least two of the sets $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{k+\\ell}$ are nice. The interval $[-d, d]$ has length $2 d$, and we saw that adjacent numbers in the circular arrangement $f\\left(A_{1}\\right), \\ldots, f\\left(A_{k+\\ell}\\right)$ differ by at most $2 d$.

Consequently, one of the sets $A_{p+1}, \\ldots, A_{q-1}$ is nice, as well as one of the sets $A_{q+1}, \\ldots, A_{p-1}$.

However the elements $z=u_{m}, x=u_{1}$, $y=u_{m-1}$ of $S_{a}$ then satisfy $z-y<2^{k}$ and $z-x \\geq 2^{k}$, so that $z=u_{m}$ is $k$-good to $S_{a}$.\n\nThus each term of the sequence $u_{2}-u_{1}, u_{3}-u_{1}, \\ldots, u_{p}-u_{1}$ is more than twice the previous one.

By the condition again, it is impossible that $S_{i}=\\{1,3,4\\}$ and $S_{j}=\\{2,3,4\\}$ for some $i, j$. So if $\\left|S_{i}\\right| \\leq 3$ for all $i$ then at most 3 summands $\\left|S_{i}\\right|-2$ are positive, corresponding to 3 -element subsets.

Thus $O$ is the only point that can possibly be the centre of the desired circle.\n\nFrom the right triangle $O A_{0} A_{1}$ we get\n\n$$\nO A_{1}^{2}=O A_{0}^{2}+A_{0} A_{1}^{2}=O A_{0}^{2}+A_{0} H^{2} .\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nLet $K$ be the midpoint of $A H$ and let $L$ be the midpoint of $C H$.

Consider the altitude $A D$ of triangle $A B C$ and its orthocentre $H$. From the cyclic quadrilaterals $C D F A$ and $C D H E$ we get $B A \\cdot B F=B C \\cdot B D=B E \\cdot B H$. Thus $B P^{2}=B E \\cdot B H$, or $B P / B H=B E / B P$, implying that the triangles $B P H$ and $B E P$ are similar. Hence\n\n$$\n\\angle B P E=\\angle B H P \\text {. }\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nThe point $P$ lies between $D$ and $C$; this follows from the equality $B P^{2}=B C \\cdot B D$.

Combining these equalities we obtain $A D \\cdot D H=D P \\cdot D Q$. Therefore $D H / D P=D Q / D A$, showing that the triangles $H D P$ and $Q D A$ are similar. Hence $\\angle H P D=\\angle Q A D$, which can be rewritten as $\\angle B P H=\\angle B A D+\\angle B A Q$.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Replace Lines:** Substitute lines with **conic sections** (circles, ellipses, etc.). This massively increases potential intersection points and removes linearity, making the crossing condition ($OX$ intersects intersecting curves) harder to compute. Change $L$ to $C$, $I$ becomes conic-conic intersections.
2.  **Add Geometric Constraint:** Impose that **all conic-section intersections ($I$) must lie inside a disk $D$** of specified center and radius $R$ (centered at $Q$, different from $O$). This adds spatial constraints and the parameter $R$.
3.  **Maximize the Red Point Count:** Instead of proving a guaranteed minimum irrespective of arrangement (the core of the proof question), transform the problem into finding the **maximum possible number of red points** over all valid sets $C$ satisfying the constraints. This is computationally intensive as it requires finding an extremal configuration.
4.  **Adjust Condition:** Retain the crossing number condition but adjust the bounds accordingly. Since number of intersections is higher (≈ $5\binom{n}{2}$ for ellipses), relax $k$ to potentially cover a wider relative range: $0 \leq k \leq 3n$.
5.  **Theme Consistency:** Retain the core theme of counting points of intersection visible from $O$ with bounded crossings through obstacles ($L$ → $C$).

Because this homothety takes $P^{\\prime}$ to $Q$, the lemma follows.\n\n\n\nRecall also that if the incircle of a triangle touches its side $A C$ at $P$, then the tangency point $Q$ of the same side and excircle $A C$ is the unique point on line segment $A C$ such that $A P=C Q$.\n\nWe pass on to the main proof. Let $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{2}$ touch $A C$ at $P$ and $Q$, respectively; then $A P=(A C+A B-B C) / 2, C Q=(C A+C D-A D) / 2$. Since $A B-B C=C D-A D$ by Lemma 1, we obtain $A P=C Q$. It follows that in triangle $A B C$ side $A C$ and excircle $A C$ are tangent at $Q$. Likewise, in triangle $A D C$ side $A C$ and excircle $A C$ are tangent at $P$. Note that $P \\neq Q$ as $A B \\neq B C$.\n\nLet $P P^{\\prime}$ and $Q Q^{\\prime}$ be the diameters perpendicular to $A C$ of $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{2}$, respectively. Then Lemma 2 shows that points $B, P^{\\prime}$ and $Q$ are collinear, and so are points $D, Q^{\\prime}$ and $P$.\n\nConsider the diameter of $\\omega$ perpendicular to $A C$ and denote by $T$ its endpoint that is closer to $A C$. The homothety with centre $B$ and ratio $B T / B P^{\\prime}$ takes $\\omega_{1}$ to $\\omega$. Hence $B, P^{\\prime}$ and $T$ are collinear. Similarly, $D, Q^{\\prime}$ and $T$ are collinear since the homothety with centre $D$ and ratio $-D T / D Q^{\\prime}$ takes $\\omega_{2}$ to $\\omega$.\n\nWe infer that points $T, P^{\\prime}$ and $Q$ are collinear, as well as $T, Q^{\\prime}$ and $P$. Since $P P^{\\prime} \\| Q Q^{\\prime}$, line segments $P P^{\\prime}$ and $Q Q^{\\prime}$ are then homothetic with centre $T$. The same holds true for circles $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{2}$ because they have $P P^{\\prime}$ and $Q Q^{\\prime}$ as diameters. Moreover, it is immediate that $T$ lies on the same side of line $P P^{\\prime}$ as $Q$ and $Q^{\\prime}$, hence the ratio of homothety is positive. In particular $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{2}$ are not congruent.\n\nIn summary, $T$ is the centre of a homothety with positive ratio that takes circle $\\omega_{1}$ to circle $\\omega_{2}$. This completes the solution, since the only point with the mentioned property is the intersection of the the common external tangents of $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{2}$.']"

4. Ensure computational hardness: The expression \(\sum_{k=0}^{2^{n-1} - 1} k \binom{2^{n} - 1}{k}\) modulo \( 2^{n+1} \) requires non-trivial binomial identities, generating functions, or Lucas-like theorems for binary carry analysis.

The base case $n=1$ is obvious.

The induction hypothesis is that all the numbers $a_{k}\\left(0 \\leq k<2^{n-2}\\right)$ are distinct $\\left(\\bmod 2^{n-1}\\right)$; the claim is that all the numbers $b_{m}\\left(0 \\leq m<2^{n-1}\\right)$ are distinct $\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)$.\n\nThe congruence relations (1) are restated as\n\n$$\nb_{2 k} \\equiv(-1)^{k} a_{k} \\equiv-b_{2 k+1} \\quad\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nShifting the exponent in the first relation of (1) from $n$ to $n-1$ we also have the congruence $a_{2 i+1} \\equiv-a_{2 i}\\left(\\bmod 2^{n-1}\\right)$.

Let\n\n$$\nM=\\left\\{m: 0 \\leq m<2^{n-1}, m \\equiv 0 \\text { or } 3(\\bmod 4)\\right\\}, \\quad L=\\left\\{l: 0 \\leq l<2^{n-1}, l \\equiv 1 \\text { or } 2(\\bmod 4)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThe last two congruences take on the unified form\n\n$$\nb_{m} \\equiv a_{\\lfloor m / 2\\rfloor} \\quad\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right) \\quad \\text { for all } \\quad m \\in M\\tag{4}\n$$\n\nThus all the numbers $b_{m}$ for $m \\in M$ are distinct $\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)$ because so are the numbers $a_{k}$ (they are distinct $\\left(\\bmod 2^{n-1}\\right)$, hence also $\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)$ ).\n\nEvery $l \\in L$ is paired with a unique $m \\in M$ into a pair of the form $\\{2 k, 2 k+1\\}$. So (2) implies that also all the $b_{l}$ for $l \\in L$ are distinct $\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)$. It remains to eliminate the possibility that $b_{m} \\equiv b_{l}\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)$ for some $m \\in M, l \\in L$.\n\nSuppose that such a situation occurs. Let $m^{\\prime} \\in M$ be such that $\\left\\{m^{\\prime}, l\\right\\}$ is a pair of the form $\\{2 k, 2 k+1\\}$, so that $(\\operatorname{see}(2)) b_{m^{\\prime}} \\equiv-b_{l}\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)$. Hence $b_{m^{\\prime}} \\equiv-b_{m}\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)$. Since both $m^{\\prime}$ and $m$ are in $M$, we have by (4) $b_{m^{\\prime}} \\equiv a_{j}, b_{m} \\equiv a_{k}\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)$ for $j=\\left\\lfloor m^{\\prime} / 2\\right\\rfloor, k=\\lfloor m / 2\\rfloor$.\n\nThen $a_{j} \\equiv-a_{k}\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)$. Thus, according to (3), $j=2 i, k=2 i+1$ for some $i$ (or vice versa). The equality $a_{2 i+1} \\equiv-a_{2 i}\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)$ now means that $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}2^{n-1}-1 \\\\ 2 i\\end{array}\\right)+\\left(\\begin{array}{c}2^{n-1}-1 \\\\ 2 i+1\\end{array}\\right) \\equiv 0\\left(\\bmod 2^{n}\\right)$.

This is a contradiction which concludes the induction step and proves the result.'
 'We again proceed by induction, writing for brevity $N=2^{n-1}$ and keeping notation $a_{k}=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}N-1 \\\\ k\\end{array}\\right), b_{m}=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}2 N-1 \\\\ m\\end{array}\\right)$. Assume that the result holds for the sequence $\\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{N / 2-1}\\right)$. In view of the symmetry $a_{N-1-k}=a_{k}$ this sequence is a permutation of $\\left(a_{0}, a_{2}, a_{4}, \\ldots, a_{N-2}\\right)$. So the induction hypothesis says that this latter sequence, taken $(\\bmod N)$, is a permutation of $(1,3,5, \\ldots, N-1)$. Similarly, the induction claim is that $\\left(b_{0}, b_{2}, b_{4}, \\ldots, b_{2 N-2}\\right)$, taken $(\\bmod 2 N)$, is a permutation of $(1,3,5, \\ldots, 2 N-1)$.\n\nIn place of the congruence relations (2) we now use the following ones,\n\n$$\nb_{4 i} \\equiv a_{2 i} \\quad(\\bmod N) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad b_{4 i+2} \\equiv b_{4 i}+N \\quad(\\bmod 2 N)\\tag{5}\n$$\n\nGiven this, the conclusion is immediate: the first formula of (5) together with the induction hypothesis tells us that $\\left(b_{0}, b_{4}, b_{8}, \\ldots, b_{2 N-4}\\right)(\\bmod N)$ is a permutation of $(1,3,5, \\ldots, N-1)$. Then the second formula of $(5)$ shows that $\\left(b_{2}, b_{6}, b_{10}, \\ldots, b_{2 N-2}\\right)(\\bmod N)$ is exactly the same permutation; moreover, this formula distinguishes $(\\bmod 2 N)$ each $b_{4 i}$ from $b_{4 i+2}$.\n\nConsequently, these two sequences combined represent $(\\bmod 2 N)$ a permutation of the sequence $(1,3,5, \\ldots, N-1, N+1, N+3, N+5, \\ldots, N+N-1)$, and this is precisely the induction claim.\n\nNow we prove formulas (5); we begin with the second one. Since $b_{m+1}=b_{m} \\cdot \\frac{2 N-m-1}{m+1}$,\n\n$$\nb_{4 i+2}=b_{4 i} \\cdot \\frac{2 N-4 i-1}{4 i+1} \\cdot \\frac{2 N-4 i-2}{4 i+2}=b_{4 i} \\cdot \\frac{2 N-4 i-1}{4 i+1} \\cdot \\frac{N-2 i-1}{2 i+1} .\n$$\n\nThe desired congruence $b_{4 i+2} \\equiv b_{4 i}+N$ may be multiplied by the odd number $(4 i+1)(2 i+1)$, giving rise to a chain of successively equivalent congruences:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nb_{4 i}(2 N-4 i-1)(N-2 i-1) & \\equiv\\left(b_{4 i}+N\\right)(4 i+1)(2 i+1) & & (\\bmod 2 N) \\\\\nb_{4 i}(2 i+1-N) & \\equiv\\left(b_{4 i}+N\\right)(2 i+1) & & (\\bmod 2 N) \\\\\n\\left(b_{4 i}+2 i+1\\right) N & \\equiv 0 & & (\\bmod 2 N)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand the last one is satisfied, as $b_{4 i}$ is odd. This settles the second relation in (5).\n\nThe first one is proved by induction on $i$. It holds for $i=0$. Assume $b_{4 i} \\equiv a_{2 i}(\\bmod 2 N)$ and consider $i+1$ :\n\n$$\nb_{4 i+4}=b_{4 i+2} \\cdot \\frac{2 N-4 i-3}{4 i+3} \\cdot \\frac{2 N-4 i-4}{4 i+4} ; \\quad a_{2 i+2}=a_{2 i} \\cdot \\frac{N-2 i-1}{2 i+1} \\cdot \\frac{N-2 i-2}{2 i+2}\n$$\n\nBoth expressions have the fraction $\\frac{N-2 i-2}{2 i+2}$ as the last factor. Since $2 i+2<N=2^{n-1}$, this fraction reduces to $\\ell / m$ with $\\ell$ and $m$ odd. In showing that $b_{4 i+4} \\equiv a_{2 i+2}(\\bmod 2 N)$, we may ignore this common factor $\\ell / m$. Clearing other odd denominators reduces the claim to\n\n$$\nb_{4 i+2}(2 N-4 i-3)(2 i+1) \\equiv a_{2 i}(N-2 i-1)(4 i+3) \\quad(\\bmod 2 N)\n$$\n\nBy the inductive assumption (saying that $b_{4 i} \\equiv a_{2 i}(\\bmod 2 N)$ ) and by the second relation of (5), this is equivalent to\n\n$$\n\\left(b_{4 i}+N\\right)(2 i+1) \\equiv b_{4 i}(2 i+1-N) \\quad(\\bmod 2 N)\n$$\n\na congruence which we have already met in the preceding proof a few lines above. This completes induction (on $i$ ) and the proof of (5), hence also the whole solution.']"

Clearly $A^{\\prime}+B^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}+C^{\\prime}, C^{\\prime}+A^{\\prime}$ are disjoint, so this partition has the properties we consider.\n\nBy the uniqueness of the example for $\\mathbb{Z}$ the sets $A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}, C^{\\prime}$ are the congruence classes modulo 3 , multiplied by $1 / N$. Also all multiples of $3 / N$ are in the same set, $A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}$ or $C^{\\prime}$. This holds for $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}$ in particular as they are all multiples of $3 / N$. However $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}$ are in different sets $A^{\\prime}, B^{\\prime}, C^{\\prime}$ since they were chosen from different sets $A, B, C$. The contradiction ends the proof.']"

**#Elements Identified#:**
*   **Polynomials:** $f$, $g$ (nonzero, integer coefficients).
*   **Degree:** $\deg f > \deg g$.
*   **Constraint:** For infinitely many primes $p$, $pf + g$ has a rational root.
*   **Conclusion:** $f$ has a rational root.
*   **Key Concept:** Relates the existence of rational roots for a linear family of polynomials over infinite primes to the existence of a root for the leading polynomial $f$.
*   **Theme:** Polynomial divisibility over $\mathbb{Q}[x]$, properties of rational roots via primes.
*   **Manipulation Points:** Degree specifications, specific coefficients, parameterizing $g$, fixing the rational root condition to require explicit calculation, introducing a third polynomial or intersection condition, replacing ""infinitely many primes"" with a computable set, demanding computation of the rational root itself, weighting coefficients.

Step 2
**#Plan#:**
1.  **Introduce Third Polynomial & Intersection Requirement:** Add a specific linear polynomial $h(x) = x - r_0$ where $r_0$ is a fixed integer. Demand that $pf(x) + g(x)$ is divisible by $h(x)$ for primes $p$. This concretizes the ""rational root"" condition and introduces a dependency between $r_0$, $f$, $g$, and $p$.
2.  **Specify Degrees and Root Identification:** Set $\deg f = d > 1$. Require the explicit computation of $f$'s rational root(s), not just existence.
3.  **Parameterize $g$:** Define $g(x)$ in terms of $f$ and $r_0$, specifically $g(x) = -(r_0)f(x) + k(x)(x - r_0)$ where $k(x)$ is another nonzero polynomial with $\deg k < \deg f$. The key complexity comes from the next step.
4.  **Constrain Coefficients:** Force all nonzero coefficients of $f$, $k$, and $g$ to be distinct prime numbers within a specific large range (e.g., between $2^{10}$ and $2^{11}$). This combines primality of coefficients with the algebraic constraint and demands complex interpolation to recover $f$.
5.  **Reword ""Infinitely Many Primes"":** Replace ""for infinitely many primes $p$"" with ""for all primes $p < N$"" where $N$ is a sufficiently large computable bound (e.g., 100) related to the coefficient size. This concrete finite set enables computation but requires capturing the root's dependence on $p$.
6.  **Computational Task:** Instead of proving existence, the problem must calculate the explicit rational root of $f$, specifically the smallest positive rational root if $f$ has multiple roots. This requires reconstructing $f$ under the divisibility and coefficient constraints.

Step 3
**#Rewritten Instruction#:**
Let $d > 1$ be an integer and $r_0$ a positive integer. Let $f(x)$ be a monic polynomial of degree $d$ and $k(x)$ a nonzero polynomial of degree less than $d$, such that every nonzero coefficient of $f$ and $k$ is a distinct prime number between $2^{10}$ and $2^{11}$.

Then for all such $x$ and all primes $p$ we have\n\n$$\n|p f(x)+g(x)| \\geq|f(x)|\\left(p-\\frac{|g(x)|}{|f(x)|}\\right)>0\n$$\n\nHence all real roots of the polynomials $p f+g$ lie in the interval $[-R, R]$.\n\nLet $f(x)=a_{n} x^{n}+a_{n-1} x^{n-1}+\\cdots+a_{0}$ and $g(x)=b_{m} x^{m}+b_{m-1} x^{m-1}+\\cdots+b_{0}$ where $n>m, a_{n} \\neq 0$ and $b_{m} \\neq 0$.

In other words one can assume that $f$ is monic. Then the leading coefficient of $p f+g$ is $p$, and if $r=u / v$ is a rational root of $p f+g$ with $(u, v)=1$ and $v>0$, then either $v=1$ or $v=p$.\n\nFirst consider the case when $v=1$ infinitely many times. If $v=1$ then $|u| \\leq R$, so there are only finitely many possibilities for the integer $u$. Therefore there exist distinct primes $p$ and $q$ for which we have the same value of $u$. Then the polynomials $p f+g$ and $q f+g$ share this root, implying $f(u)=g(u)=0$. So in this case $f$ and $g$ have an integer root in common.\n\nNow suppose that $v=p$ infinitely many times. By comparing the exponent of $p$ in the denominators of $p f(u / p)$ and $g(u / p)$ we get $m=n-1$ and $p f(u / p)+g(u / p)=0$ reduces to an equation of the form\n\n$$\n\\left(u^{n}+a_{n-1} p u^{n-1}+\\ldots+a_{0} p^{n}\\right)+\\left(b_{n-1} u^{n-1}+b_{n-2} p u^{n-2}+\\ldots+b_{0} p^{n-1}\\right)=0 .\n$$\n\nThe equation above implies that $u^{n}+b_{n-1} u^{n-1}$ is divisible by $p$ and hence, since $(u, p)=1$, we have $u+b_{n-1}=p k$ with some integer $k$. On the other hand all roots of $p f+g$ lie in the interval $[-R, R]$, so that\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\frac{\\left|p k-b_{n-1}\\right|}{p}=\\frac{|u|}{p}<R, \\\\\n|k|<R+\\frac{\\left|b_{n-1}\\right|}{p}<R+\\left|b_{n-1}\\right| .\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nTherefore the integer $k$ can attain only finitely many values.

Since the left-hand side is a polynomial, this implies that (1) is a polynomial identity, so it holds for all real $x$. In particular, by substituting $x=0$ in (1) we get $f(k)=0$. Thus the integer $k$ is a root of $f$.\n\nIn summary the monic polynomial $f$ obtained after the initial reduction always has an integer root.
