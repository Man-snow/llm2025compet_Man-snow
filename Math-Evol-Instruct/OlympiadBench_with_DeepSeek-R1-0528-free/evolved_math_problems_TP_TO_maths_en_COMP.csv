#Elements Identified#:
- **Variables**: Convex quadrilaterals \(P\) and \(P^{\prime}\), their intersecting point \(O\), lines \(\ell\) through \(O\), chord segments \(\ell \cap P\) and \(\ell \cap P^{\prime}\), area ratio \(\frac{\text{area}(P^{\prime})}{\text{area}(P)}\).
- **Condition**: For every line \(\ell\) through \(O\), the length of \(\ell \cap P\) is strictly greater than the length of \(\ell \cap P^{\prime}\).
- **Original Query**: Investigate if the area ratio can exceed 1.9.
- **Theme**: Geometric constraints on quadrilaterals involving chord lengths and area ratios, with the core of comparing the ""magnitude"" of the sets relative to a common point.
- **Proof Focus**: The original is a yes/no proof-based question.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. **Transform Proof to Computation**: Instead of a threshold (1.9), compute the supremum of the ratio \(\frac{\text{area}(P^{\prime})}{\text{area}(P)}\) over all valid \((P, P^{\prime}, O)\), which requires determining a precise numerical limit, not a binary outcome.
2. **Increase Dimensionality**: Generalize from quadrilaterals to \(n\)-sided convex polygons and ask for the \(n\)-dependent supremum. This introduces integer parameters and sequences, necessitates computation for variable \(n\), and links to asymptotic analysis.
3. **Add Real-World Constraints**: Require \(O\) to be the centroid of both polygons (imposing symmetry), which intensifies constraints and refines the supremum calculation.
4. **Optimization Focus**: Demand the supremum as a function of \(n\) and specify computation for large \(n\) and the limit, forcing advanced techniques (e.g., supporting functions, isoperimetric inequalities) and combining geometry with limit theory.
5. **Complexity Justification**: Centroid constraints and polygon generality maintain theme coherence while elevating difficulty via additional dependencies and numerical optimization. Avoid trivial cases by anchoring to arbitrary \(n\) and infimum computation.

Since $\\mathrm{O}_{1} \\mathrm{O}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{3} \\mathrm{O}_{4}$ is a parallelogram, $\\overrightarrow{F_{1} F_{2}}+\\overrightarrow{F_{3} F_{4}}=\\mathbf{0}$ and $\\overrightarrow{F_{2} F_{3}}+\\overrightarrow{F_{4} F_{1}}=\\mathbf{0}$; this still holds in the degenerate case, for if the $O_{i}$ are collinear, then they all lie on the line $T_{1} T_{4}$, and each $O_{i}$ is the midpoint of the segment $T_{i} T_{i+1}$. Consequently,\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\n\\overrightarrow{P Q}-\\overrightarrow{R S}+\\overrightarrow{T U}-\\overrightarrow{V W}= & \\left(\\overrightarrow{P F_{1}}+\\overrightarrow{F_{1} F_{2}}+\\overrightarrow{F_{2} Q}\\right)-\\left(\\overrightarrow{R F_{2}}+\\overrightarrow{F_{2} F_{3}}+\\overrightarrow{F_{3} S}\\right) \\\\\n\n& +\\left(\\overrightarrow{T F_{3}}+\\overrightarrow{F_{3} F_{4}}+\\overrightarrow{F_{4} U}\\right)-\\left(\\overrightarrow{V F_{4}}+\\overrightarrow{F_{4} F_{1}}+\\overrightarrow{F_{1} W}\\right) \\\\\n\n= & \\left(\\overrightarrow{P F_{1}}-\\overrightarrow{F_{1} W}\\right)-\\left(\\overrightarrow{R F_{2}}-\\overrightarrow{F_{2} Q}\\right)+\\left(\\overrightarrow{T F_{3}}-\\overrightarrow{F_{3} S}\\right)-\\left(\\overrightarrow{V F_{4}}-\\overrightarrow{F_{4} U}\\right) \\\\\n\n& +\\left(\\overrightarrow{F_{1} F_{2}}+\\overrightarrow{F_{3} F_{4}}\\right)-\\left(\\overrightarrow{F_{2} F_{3}}+\\overrightarrow{F_{4} F_{1}}\\right)=\\mathbf{0} .\n\n\\end{aligned}\n\n$$\n\n\n\nAlternatively, but equivalently, $\\overrightarrow{P Q}+\\overrightarrow{T U}=\\overrightarrow{R S}+\\overrightarrow{V W}$, as required.\n\n\n\nSecond Approach. This is merely another way of reading the previous argument. Fix an orientation of the line $P W$, say, from $P$ towards $W$, and use a lower case letter to denote the coordinate of a point labelled by the corresponding upper case letter.\n\n\n\nSince the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect one another, $f_{1}+f_{3}=f_{2}+f_{4}$, the common value being twice the coordinate of the projection to $P W$ of the point where $O_{1} O_{3}$ and $O_{2} O_{4}$ cross; the relation clearly holds in the degenerate case as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlug $f_{1}=\\frac{1}{2}(p+w), f_{2}=\\frac{1}{2}(q+r), f_{3}=\\frac{1}{2}(s+t)$ and $f_{4}=\\frac{1}{2}(u+v)$ into the above equality to get $p+w+s+t=q+r+u+v$. Alternatively, but equivalently, $(q-p)+(u-t)=(s-r)+(w-v)$, that is, $P Q+T U=R Q+V W$, as required.']"
1607,A number of 17 workers stand in a row. Every contiguous group of at least 2 workers is a brigade. The chief wants to assign each brigade a leader (which is a member of the brigade) so that each worker's number of assignments is divisible by 4 . Prove that the number of such ways to assign the leaders is divisible by 17 .,"**  
For \(n = 1000\) workers in a row, every contiguous group of at least 2 is a brigade. Assign each brigade a leader from its members. Each worker \(i\) must have a total number of leaderships divisible by \(\gcd(i+1, 4)\). Moreover, for every three consecutive brigades that overlap, their leaders must be distinct. Compute the number of valid assignments modulo \(10^9 + 7\).","Step 1
**#Elements Identified#:**
- **Participants:** Workers (fixed number: 17).
- **Structure:** Workers in a row; contiguous groups of ≥2 workers defined as ""brigades"".
- **Actions:** Assign a leader to each brigade (leader must be a member of the brigade).
- **Conditions:** Each worker's total number of leader assignments must be divisible by 4.
- **Goal:** Prove the number of valid assignment schemes is divisible by 17.
- **Theme:** Combinatorial assignment with divisibility constraints and prime-related conclusion.

Step 2
**#Plan#:**
1. **Generalize workers:** Replace fixed 17 workers with a variable \(n\) (set to a large computable value: \(n = 1000\)).  
2. **Add constraint layers:**  
   - Modify the ""assignment condition"": Require each worker \(i\)'s assignments to be divisible by \(\gcd(i + k, m)\) for introduced \(k, m\) (adds positional dependency).  
   - Impose a global ""overlap constraint"": For every set of \(k\) overlapping/consecutive brigades, leaders must be distinct (prevents trivial assignments).  
3. **Increase computational complexity:**  
   - Demand the exact number of valid assignments modulo a large prime (\(10^9 + 7\)) instead of a divisibility proof.  
   - Introduce an auxiliary variable \(k = 3\) to define the overlap constraint and positional divisor (\(\gcd(i+1, 4)\)).  
   - Set \(n = 1000\) to force non-enumerable solutions and algorithmic efficiency.  
4. **Maintain theme:** Preserve contiguous brigades and leader assignments but integrate new dependencies (position-based divisors, inter-brigade uniqueness).  

Step 3
**#Rewritten Instruction#:**  
For \(n = 1000\) workers in a row, every contiguous group of at least 2 is a brigade. Assign each brigade a leader from its members. Each worker \(i\) must have a total number of leaderships divisible by \(\gcd(i+1, 4)\). Moreover, in every trio of consecutive brigades that share workers, the three leaders must be distinct participants. Calculate the number of valid assignments modulo \(10^9 + 7\).  

Step 4
**#Finally Rewritten Instruction#:**  
For \(n = 1000\) workers in a row, every contiguous group of at least 2 is a brigade. Assign each brigade a leader from its members. Each worker \(i\) must have a total number of leaderships divisible by \(\gcd(i+1, 4)\). Moreover, for every three consecutive brigades that overlap, their leaders must be distinct. Compute the number of valid assignments modulo \(10^9 + 7\).",success,37.82,"[""Assume that every single worker also forms a brigade (with a unique possible leader). In this modified setting, we are interested in the number $N$ of ways to assign leadership so that each worker's number of assignments is congruent to 1 modulo 4.\n\n\n\nConsider the variables $x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{17}$ corresponding to the workers. Assign each brigade (from the $i$-th through the $j$-th worker) the polynomial $f_{i j}=x_{i}+x_{i+1}+\\cdots+x_{j}$, and form the product $f=\\prod_{1 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq 17} f_{i j}$. The number $N$ is the sum $\\Sigma(f)$ of the coefficients of all monomials $x_{1}^{\\alpha_{1}} x_{2}^{\\alpha_{2}} \\ldots x_{17}^{\\alpha_{17}}$ in the expansion of $f$, where the $\\alpha_{i}$ are all congruent to 1 modulo 4 . For any polynomial $P$, let $\\Sigma(P)$ denote the corresponding sum. From now on, all polynomials are considered with coefficients in the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{17}$.\n\n\n\nRecall that for any positive integer $n$, and any integers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$, there exist indices $i \\leq j$ such that $a_{i}+a_{i+1}+\\cdots+a_{j}$ is divisible by $n$. Consequently, $f\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{17}\\right)=0$ for all $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{17}$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{17}$.\n\n\n\nNow, if some monomial in the expansion of $f$ is divisible by $x_{i}^{17}$, replace that $x_{i}^{17}$ by $x_{i}$; this does not alter the above overall vanishing property (by Fermat's Little Theorem), and preserves $\\Sigma(f)$. After several such changes, $f$ transforms into a polynomial $g$ whose degree in each variable does not exceed 16 , and $g\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{17}\\right)=0$ for all $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{17}$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{17}$. For such a polynomial, an easy induction on the number of variables shows that it is identically zero. Consequently, $\\Sigma(g)=0$, so $\\Sigma(f)=0$ as well, as desired.""]"
