A horizontal or vertical line, which intersects the interior of the square but does not intersect the interior of any rectangle, will be called a splitting line.

Consider such a dissection with the least possible number of rectangles. Notice that this number of rectangles is greater than 2, otherwise their common side provides a splitting line.\n\nIf there exist two rectangles having a common side, then we can replace them by their union (see Figure 1). The number of rectangles was greater than 2, so in a new dissection it is greater than 1. Clearly, in the new dissection, there is also no splitting line as well as no interior rectangle. This contradicts the choice of the original dissection.\n\nDenote the initial square by $A B C D$, with $A$ and $B$ being respectively the lower left and lower right vertices. Consider those two rectangles $a$ and $b$ containing vertices $A$ and $B$, respectively. (Note that $a \\neq b$, otherwise its top side provides a splitting line.) We can assume that the height of $a$ is not greater than that of $b$. Then consider the rectangle $c$ neighboring to the lower right corner of $a$ (it may happen that $c=b$ ).

Then $d$ has a common point with $C D$, and its left side provides a splitting line. Contradiction.\n\nCase 2. The height of $c$ is greater than that of $a$. Analogously, consider the rectangle $d$ containing the angle marked on Figure 3. It has no common point with $A D$ (otherwise it has a common side with $a$ ), as well as no common point with $A B$ or with $B C$ (obviously). Then $d$ has a common point with $C D$.

 'Again, we suppose the contrary. Consider an arbitrary counterexample. Then we know that each rectangle is attached to at least one side of the square.

We claim that there exist two opposite rectangles having a common point.\n\nConsider the union $L$ of all rectangles attached to the left. Assume, to the contrary, that $L$ has no common point with the rectangles attached to the right. Take a polygonal line $p$ connecting the top and the bottom sides of the square and passing close from the right to the boundary of $L$ (see Figure 4). Then all its points belong to the rectangles attached either to the top or to the bottom. Moreover, the upper end-point of $p$ belongs to a rectangle attached to the top, and the lower one belongs to an other rectangle attached to the bottom. Hence, there is a point on $p$ where some rectangles attached to the top and to the bottom meet each other.

We can assume that $a$ is attached to the left and $b$ is attached to the right. Let $X$ be their common point. If $X$ belongs to their horizontal sides (in particular, $X$ may appear to be a common vertex of $a$ and $b$ ), then these sides provide a splitting line (see Figure 5). Otherwise, $X$ lies on the vertical sides. Let $\\ell$ be the line containing these sides.\n\nSince $\\ell$ is not a splitting line, it intersects the interior of some rectangle. Let $c$ be such a rectangle, closest to $X$; we can assume that $c$ lies above $X$. Let $Y$ be the common point of $\\ell$ and the bottom side of $c$ (see Figure 6). Then $Y$ is also a vertex of two rectangles lying below $c$.\n\nSo, let $Y$ be the upper-right and upper-left corners of the rectangles $a^{\\prime}$ and $b^{\\prime}$, respectively. Then $a^{\\prime}$ and $b^{\\prime}$ are situated not lower than $a$ and $b$, respectively (it may happen that $a=a^{\\prime}$ or $b=b^{\\prime}$ ). We claim that $a^{\\prime}$ is attached to the left. If $a=a^{\\prime}$ then of course it is. If $a \\neq a^{\\prime}$ then $a^{\\prime}$ is above $a$, below $c$ and to the left from $b^{\\prime}$. Hence, it can be attached to the left only.\n\nAnalogously, $b^{\\prime}$ is attached to the right. Now, the top sides of these two rectangles pass through $Y$, hence they provide a splitting line again. This last contradiction completes the proof.']"

To the contrary, assume that for all $k$, all the numbers in $A_{k}$ lie in interval $(-n / 2, n / 2)$. Consider an arbitrary sequence $A_{k}=\\left(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right)$. To obtain the term $b_{i}$, we increased and decreased number $a_{i}$ by one several times. Therefore $b_{i}-a_{i}$ is always an integer, and there are not more than $n$ possible values for $b_{i}$. So, there are not more than $n^{n}$ distinct possible sequences $A_{k}$, and hence two of the sequences $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{n^{n}+1}$ should be identical, say $A_{p}=A_{q}$ for some $p<q$.\n\nFor any positive integer $k$, let $S_{k}$ be the sum of squares of elements in $A_{k}$.

#Elements Identified#:
- The function \(f\) mapping real numbers to real numbers.
- The functional inequality \(f(x+y) \leq y f(x) + f(f(x))\) for all real numbers \(x\) and \(y\).
- The property that \(f(x) = 0\) for all \(x \leq 0\), which emerges from the original proof.
- Actions: Prove a property (show \(f(x) = 0\) for \(x \leq 0\)).
- Theme: Functional inequality constraining behavior.

#Plan#:
1. **Increase complexity by shifting to computation**: Instead of requesting a proof, ask for a specific numerical value involving \(f\) at a large integer (e.g., \(f(2024)\)), which requires deriving constraints from the inequality.
2. **Add concrete constraints for computability**: Specify that \(f(1) = -1\) to impose non-triviality and enable calculation, leveraging that the inequality forces \(f(f(1))\) to lie in a bounded interval.
3. **Enhance reasoning with bound derivation**: Require computation of \(f(f(1))\), which can be derived by manipulating the inequality and using \(f(1) = -1\), yielding a specific value under the constraints.
4. **Ensure interconnection**: Link the computation to the core inequality and \(f(x) = 0\) for \(x \leq 0\), confirming it reflects the theme while adding complexity via bound analysis.

- **Actions/Processes**: Proving that the circumcircle and \(\omega\) intersect at two points, which involves geometric properties like tangency, circle centers, and arc constraints.  
- **Theme**: Circle geometry with tangency and circumcenter properties, focusing on constraints and intersections.  

### Step 2
**#Plan#**:  
1. **Modify the conclusion** from proof to computation: Instead of proving intersection, demand calculation of the **exact length of the common chord** between \(\omega\) and the circumcircle, a specific numerical value derived from parameters.  
2. **Add complex parameters**: Introduce fixed numerical values for \(BC = 6\), \(\angle B = 45^\circ\), and \(\angle C = 75^\circ\), requiring trigonometry to solve for other elements. Specify that \(L\) divides \(BC\) in ratio \(k = 2:1\) (so \(BL:LC = 2:1\)) instead of being on the angle bisector, adding asymmetry.  
3. **Concretize constraints**: Require that \(O\) lies on the shorter arc using coordinate geometry, imposing a real-world dependency where coordinates must be computed, and introduce an optimization twist: find the ratio \(k\) that minimizes the common chord length while satisfying the arc condition.  
- **Interconnections**: The ratio \(k\) affects \(L\)'s position, which influences \(\omega\)'s radius, tangency points, and \(O\)'s position. The common chord length computation integrates trigonometry, coordinate geometry, and circle equations.  
- **Complexity Increase**: Solving involves trigonometric computation (angles), coordinate setup (points, circles), solving circle equations for intersection, and minimization under constraints, making it harder than the proof.

#Plan#:
1.  **Increase Dimension/Complexity of Shape**: Replace the quadrilateral with a non-regular tetrahedron ($A_1A_2A_3A_4$) in 3D space. This fundamentally increases geometric complexity, moves the circumcenter calculation to spheres, and naturally fits the theme of using circumspheres of triangular faces. Requires dealing with vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and sphere equations.
2.  **Specify Parameters & Require Numerical Computation**: Assign specific, non-trivial 3D coordinates to the vertices designed to require significant coordinate geometry and vector/matrix computation. Require the computation of the numerical value of the analogous sum, demanding intermediate calculations (vectors, distances, sphere centers, radii). This turns proof into specific computation.
3.  **Add Real-World Constraint and Dependency**: Incorporate a dynamic ""resistance"" factor $\kappa_k$ dependent on vector properties. Define $\kappa_k = 0.01 \times \|\mathbf{v}_k\|$, where $\mathbf{v}_k = \overrightarrow{A_{k-1} A_k}$ (cyclic indices). This links displacement vectors to the terms, adds physical interpretation, and increases algebraic complexity.
4.  **Modify Expression Complexity**: Replace the denominator $O_kA_k^2 - r_k^2$ in each term with $\frac{\kappa_k}{O_kA_k^2 - r_k^2}$. This incorporates the resistance factor multiplicatively and prevents trivial cancellation (unlike an obvious $\lambda_k$ added linearly).

 'We split the solution into a sequence of claims; in each claim, the letters $m$ and $n$ denote arbitrary integers.\n\nClaim 1. $f(n) \\mid f(m n)$.\n\nProof. Since trivially $f(n) \\mid f(1 \\cdot n)$ and $f(n) \\mid f((k+1) n)-f(k n)$ for all integers $k$, this is easily seen by using induction on $m$ in both directions.\n\nClaim 2. $f(n) \\mid f(0)$ and $f(n)=f(-n)$.\n\nProof. The first part follows by plugging $m=0$ into Claim 1. Using Claim 1 twice with $m=-1$, we get $f(n)|f(-n)| f(n)$, from which the second part follows.\n\nFrom Claim 1, we get $f(1) \\mid f(n)$ for all integers $n$, so $f(1)$ is the minimal value attained by $f$. Next, from Claim 2, the function $f$ can attain only a finite number of values since all these values divide $f(0)$.\n\nNow we prove the statement of the problem by induction on the number $N_{f}$ of values attained by $f$. In the base case $N_{f} \\leq 2$, we either have $f(0) \\neq f(1)$, in which case these two numbers are the only values attained by $f$ and the statement is clear, or we have $f(0)=f(1)$, in which case we have $f(1)|f(n)| f(0)$ for all integers $n$, so $f$ is constant and the statement is obvious again.\n\nFor the induction step, assume that $N_{f} \\geq 3$, and let $a$ be the least positive integer with $f(a)>f(1)$. Note that such a number exists due to the symmetry of $f$ obtained in Claim 2 .\n\n\n\nClaim 3. $f(n) \\neq f(1)$ if and only if $a \\mid n$.\n\nProof. Since $f(1)=\\cdots=f(a-1)<f(a)$, the claim follows from the fact that\n\n$$\nf(n)=f(1) \\Longleftrightarrow f(n+a)=f(1) .\n$$\n\nSo it suffices to prove this fact.\n\nAssume that $f(n)=f(1)$. Then $f(n+a) \\mid f(a)-f(-n)=f(a)-f(n)>0$, so $f(n+a) \\leq$ $f(a)-f(n)<f(a)$; in particular the difference $f(n+a)-f(n)$ is stricly smaller than $f(a)$. Furthermore, this difference is divisible by $f(a)$ and nonnegative since $f(n)=f(1)$ is the least value attained by $f$. So we have $f(n+a)-f(n)=0$, as desired. For the converse direction we only need to remark that $f(n+a)=f(1)$ entails $f(-n-a)=f(1)$, and hence $f(n)=f(-n)=f(1)$ by the forward implication.\n\nWe return to the induction step. So let us take two arbitrary integers $m$ and $n$ with $f(m) \\leq f(n)$. If $a \\nmid m$, then we have $f(m)=f(1) \\mid f(n)$. On the other hand, suppose that $a \\mid m$; then by Claim $3 a \\mid n$ as well. Now define the function $g(x)=f(a x)$. Clearly, $g$ satisfies the conditions of the problem, but $N_{g}<N_{f}-1$, since $g$ does not attain $f(1)$. Hence, by the induction hypothesis, $f(m)=g(m / a) \\mid g(n / a)=f(n)$, as desired.']"

2. **Elevate the computational requirement**: Instead of proving divisibility, require the computation of the integer $(p-1)!

This shifts to a high-precision modular computation, leveraging Wilson's theorem and p-adic properties, and makes the problem concrete and numerical.

Use $c = (k | p)$ as a coefficient.
4. **Set a large prime for computation**: Fix $p=11$ and $k=5$ to ensure non-trivial calculation while avoiding small cases. The Legendre symbol $(5|11)$ must be computed manually first, as $5$ is a quadratic residue modulo $11?$: $5 \equiv 16 \pmod{11}$, so $(5|11) = 1$.

#Elements Identified#:
- **Key Variable:** Positive integer `k`, defining `n = 2^k + 1` (a Fermat number structure).
- **Central Condition:** Primality of `n`.
- **Core Objects:**
  - A permutation `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}` of the integers `1` to `n-1`.
  - A sequence of integers `g_1, g_2, ..., g_{n-1}`.
- **Key Constraint:** `n` divides `g_i^{a_i} - a_{i+1}` for every `i` (with cyclic boundary `a_n = a_1`).
- **Proof Goal:** Establish equivalence between `n` being prime and the existence of such sequences.
- **Theme:** Relating primality of Fermat-type numbers to the existence of sequences satisfying iterative congruences.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **From Proof to Computation:** Replace the primality check with a specific combinatorial count and optimization computation. Instead of proving equivalence for existence, compute *how many* valid permutations exist for a fixed `k` *and* find optimal values of new parameters under constraints.
2.  **Generalize the Congruence:** Introduce an integer perturbation term `δ` into the congruence condition, requiring `g_i^{a_i} ≡ a_{i+1} + δ` (mod `n`) for all `i`. `δ` must be the *same* for all congruences in a solution. This breaks the direct link to primality.
3.  **Add Optimization Objectives:**
    - Require finding the minimal possible value of `δ` (over all valid solutions).
    - For solutions achieving this minimal `δ`, require finding the minimal possible sum of the absolute values of the `g_i` (i.e., minimize `Σ|g_i|`).
4.  **Focus on Non-Trivial Case:** Specify `k > 1` to force larger `n`.
5.  **Increase Scope:** Ask for the count of valid permutations contributing to solutions achieving both minima (`δ_min` and the corresponding minimal `Σ|g_i|`). This combines hard counting with optimization.

For $a, b \\in N$, we say that $b$ follows $a$ if there exists an integer $g$ such that $b \\equiv g^{a}(\\bmod n)$ and denote this property as $a \\rightarrow b$. This way we have a directed graph with $N$ as set of vertices. If $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n-1}$ is a permutation of $1,2, \\ldots, n-1$ such that $a_{1} \\rightarrow a_{2} \\rightarrow \\ldots \\rightarrow a_{n-1} \\rightarrow a_{1}$ then this is a Hamiltonian cycle in the graph.\n\nStep I. First consider the case when $n$ is composite. Let $n=p_{1}^{\\alpha_{1}} \\ldots p_{s}^{\\alpha_{s}}$ be its prime factorization. All primes $p_{i}$ are odd.\n\nSuppose that $\\alpha_{i}>1$ for some $i$. For all integers $a, g$ with $a \\geq 2$, we have $g^{a} \\not \\equiv p_{i}\\left(\\bmod p_{i}^{2}\\right)$, because $g^{a}$ is either divisible by $p_{i}^{2}$ or it is not divisible by $p_{i}$. It follows that in any Hamiltonian cycle $p_{i}$ comes immediately after 1 . The same argument shows that $2 p_{i}$ also should come immediately after 1, which is impossible. Hence, there is no Hamiltonian cycle in the graph.\n\nNow suppose that $n$ is square-free. We have $n=p_{1} p_{2} \\ldots p_{s}>9$ and $s \\geq 2$. Assume that there exists a Hamiltonian cycle. There are $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ even numbers in this cycle, and each number which follows one of them should be a quadratic residue modulo $n$. So, there should be at least $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ nonzero quadratic residues modulo $n$. On the other hand, for each $p_{i}$ there exist exactly $\\frac{p_{i}+1}{2}$ quadratic residues modulo $p_{i}$; by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the number of quadratic residues modulo $n$ is exactly $\\frac{p_{1}+1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{p_{2}+1}{2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot \\frac{p_{s}+1}{2}$, including 0 .

For any $a, b \\in N$, we have $a \\rightarrow b$ if and only if $\\nu_{2}(a) \\leq \\mu(b)$.\n\nProof. Let $\\ell=\\nu_{2}(a)$ and $m=\\mu(b)$.\n\nSuppose $\\ell \\leq m$. Since $b$ follows $2^{m}$, there exists some $g_{0}$ such that $b \\equiv g_{0}^{2^{m}}(\\bmod n)$. By $\\operatorname{gcd}(a, n-1)=2^{\\ell}$ there exist some integers $p$ and $q$ such that $p a-q(n-1)=2^{\\ell}$. Choosing $g=g_{0}^{2^{m-\\ell} p}$ we have $g^{a}=g_{0}^{2^{m-\\ell} p a}=g_{0}^{2^{m}+2^{m-\\ell} q(n-1)} \\equiv g_{0}^{2^{m}} \\equiv b(\\bmod n)$ by FERMAT\'s theorem. Hence, $a \\rightarrow b$.\n\nTo prove the reverse statement, suppose that $a \\rightarrow b$, so $b \\equiv g^{a}(\\bmod n)$ with some $g$. Then $b \\equiv\\left(g^{a / 2^{\\ell}}\\right)^{2^{\\ell}}$, and therefore $2^{\\ell} \\rightarrow b$. By the definition of $\\mu(b)$, we have $\\mu(b) \\geq \\ell$. The lemma is\n\n\n\nproved.\n\nNow for every $i$ with $0 \\leq i \\leq k$, let\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nA_{i} & =\\left\\{a \\in N \\mid \\nu_{2}(a)=i\\right\\}, \\\\\nB_{i} & =\\{a \\in N \\mid \\mu(a)=i\\}, \\\\\n\\text { and } C_{i} & =\\{a \\in N \\mid \\mu(a) \\geq i\\}=B_{i} \\cup B_{i+1} \\cup \\ldots \\cup B_{k} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe claim that $\\left|A_{i}\\right|=\\left|B_{i}\\right|$ for all $0 \\leq i \\leq k$. Obviously we have $\\left|A_{i}\\right|=2^{k-i-1}$ for all $i=$ $0, \\ldots, k-1$, and $\\left|A_{k}\\right|=1$. Now we determine $\\left|C_{i}\\right|$. We have $\\left|C_{0}\\right|=n-1$ and by Fermat\'s theorem we also have $C_{k}=\\{1\\}$, so $\\left|C_{k}\\right|=1$. Next, notice that $C_{i+1}=\\left\\{x^{2} \\bmod n \\mid x \\in C_{i}\\right\\}$. For every $a \\in N$, the relation $x^{2} \\equiv a(\\bmod n)$ has at most two solutions in $N$. Therefore we have $2\\left|C_{i+1}\\right| \\leq\\left|C_{i}\\right|$, with the equality achieved only if for every $y \\in C_{i+1}$, there exist distinct elements $x, x^{\\prime} \\in C_{i}$ such that $x^{2} \\equiv x^{\\prime 2} \\equiv y(\\bmod n)$ (this implies $\\left.x+x^{\\prime}=n\\right)$. Now, since $2^{k}\\left|C_{k}\\right|=\\left|C_{0}\\right|$, we obtain that this equality should be achieved in each step. Hence $\\left|C_{i}\\right|=2^{k-i}$ for $0 \\leq i \\leq k$, and therefore $\\left|B_{i}\\right|=2^{k-i-1}$ for $0 \\leq i \\leq k-1$ and $\\left|B_{k}\\right|=1$.\n\nFrom the previous arguments we can see that for each $z \\in C_{i}(0 \\leq i<k)$ the equation $x^{2} \\equiv z^{2}$ $(\\bmod n)$ has two solutions in $C_{i}$, so we have $n-z \\in C_{i}$. Hence, for each $i=0,1, \\ldots, k-1$, exactly half of the elements of $C_{i}$ are odd. The same statement is valid for $B_{i}=C_{i} \\backslash C_{i+1}$ for $0 \\leq i \\leq k-2$. In particular, each such $B_{i}$ contains an odd number. Note that $B_{k}=\\{1\\}$ also contains an odd number, and $B_{k-1}=\\left\\{2^{k}\\right\\}$ since $C_{k-1}$ consists of the two square roots of 1 modulo $n$.\n\nStep III. Now we construct a Hamiltonian cycle in the graph. First, for each $i$ with $0 \\leq i \\leq k$, connect the elements of $A_{i}$ to the elements of $B_{i}$ by means of an arbitrary bijection. After performing this for every $i$, we obtain a subgraph with all vertices having in-degree 1 and outdegree 1, so the subgraph is a disjoint union of cycles. If there is a unique cycle, we are done. Otherwise, we modify the subgraph in such a way that the previous property is preserved and the number of cycles decreases; after a finite number of steps we arrive at a single cycle.\n\nFor every cycle $C$, let $\\lambda(C)=\\min _{c \\in C} \\nu_{2}(c)$. Consider a cycle $C$ for which $\\lambda(C)$ is maximal. If $\\lambda(C)=0$, then for any other cycle $C^{\\prime}$ we have $\\lambda\\left(C^{\\prime}\\right)=0$. Take two arbitrary vertices $a \\in C$ and $a^{\\prime} \\in C^{\\prime}$ such that $\\nu_{2}(a)=\\nu_{2}\\left(a^{\\prime}\\right)=0$; let their direct successors be $b$ and $b^{\\prime}$, respectively. Then we can unify $C$ and $C^{\\prime}$ to a single cycle by replacing the edges $a \\rightarrow b$ and $a^{\\prime} \\rightarrow b^{\\prime}$ by $a \\rightarrow b^{\\prime}$ and $a^{\\prime} \\rightarrow b$.\n\nNow suppose that $\\lambda=\\lambda(C) \\geq 1$; let $a \\in C \\cap A_{\\lambda}$. If there exists some $a^{\\prime} \\in A_{\\lambda} \\backslash C$, then $a^{\\prime}$ lies in another cycle $C^{\\prime}$ and we can merge the two cycles in exactly the same way as above. So, the only remaining case is $A_{\\lambda} \\subset C$. Since the edges from $A_{\\lambda}$ lead to $B_{\\lambda}$, we get also $B_{\\lambda} \\subset C$. If $\\lambda \\neq k-1$ then $B_{\\lambda}$ contains an odd number; this contradicts the assumption $\\lambda(C)>0$. Finally, if $\\lambda=k-1$, then $C$ contains $2^{k-1}$ which is the only element of $A_{k-1}$. Since $B_{k-1}=\\left\\{2^{k}\\right\\}=A_{k}$ and $B_{k}=\\{1\\}$, the cycle $C$ contains the path $2^{k-1} \\rightarrow 2^{k} \\rightarrow 1$ and it contains an odd number again.

*   **Theme:** Analyzing the cumulative effect of a recursively defined sequence with sign alterations based on parity.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Replace Sum with Product:** Transform the ""sum"" ($\sum$) into a ""product"" ($\prod$). Products are harder to analyze cumulative cancellations for than sums in this context.
2.  **Large Fixed Calculation:** Shift the goal from proving non-negativity for all $n$ to computing a specific numerical value for a *large*, fixed $n$. Choose $n$ as a power of a composite number (e.g., $2025^{10} = (3^2 \cdot 5^2)^{10} = 3^{20} \cdot 5^{20}$) for computational complexity.
3.  **Introduce Conditional Product:** Instead of taking the product over all terms $1$ to $n$, complicate it by taking the product only over indices $1 \leq k \leq n$ that satisfy a specific, related divisibility condition: $k$ must be expressly divisible by a large factor of $n$ (e.g., $n$ itself, $2025^{10}$).
4.  **Concretize the Challenge:** Require the computation of $s$, defined as the sum $\sum_{d \mid n} \prod_{\substack{k=1 \\ \gcd(k, d) = d}}^{n} x_k$. Here, $d$ divides $n$, and for each divisor $d$, we compute the product of $x_k$ for all $k$ in $1$ to $n$ that are multiples of $d$. Then sum these products over all divisors $d$ of $n$.
5.  **Ensuring Coherence and Complexity:** Large exponents ($20$) ensure $n$ is huge ($\approx 10^{77}$), making direct computation impossible. Calculating $x_k$ requires $\log_2 k$ recursion steps, but the key complexity comes from:
    *   Needing a deep understanding of *which* terms in the original product are $\pm 1$ and *which* are $0$ (implied by divisibility constraints).
    *   Identifying the specific $x_k$ values ($\pm 1$) efficiently based on the multiplicative structure encoded in the recursive rules and the complicated index sets defined by the divisors $d$ of $n$ and the condition $\gcd(k, d) = d$ (which is equivalent to $d \mid k$).
    *   Combining these partial products for all divisors $d$ of $n$.
This leverages the sequence's structure dramatically and shifts the problem to non-trivial computation heavily reliant on number theory and the recursive properties.

 'We will use the notation of $S_{n}$ and the relations (1)-(3) from the previous solution.\n\nAssume the contrary and consider the minimal $n$ such that $S_{n+1}<0$; surely $n \\geq 1$, and from $S_{n} \\geq 0$ we get $S_{n}=0, x_{n+1}=-1$.

1.   **Transform Proof to Computation:** Replace ""Prove \(f(n)=g(n)\)"" with ""Compute \(f(n)\) for a specific \(n\)"" requiring complex recursive determination.  
2.   **Alter Functional Equations:** Make equations asymmetric and input-dependent (e.g., applicable only for *odd* integers). Replace the additive increment in the second equation with multiplicative growth (`2*g(n)`).

Now let $a$ and $b$ are the minimal values attained by $f$ and $g$, respectively; say $f\\left(n_{f}\\right)=a, g\\left(n_{g}\\right)=b$. Then we have $f\\left(g^{k}\\left(n_{f}\\right)\\right)=a+k, g\\left(f^{k}\\left(n_{g}\\right)\\right)=b+k$, so the function $f$ attains all values from the set $N_{f}=\\{a, a+1, \\ldots\\}$, while $g$ attains all the values from the set $N_{g}=\\{b, b+1, \\ldots\\}$.\n\nNext, note that $f(x)=f(y)$ implies $g(x)=g(f(x))-1=g(f(y))-1=g(y)$; surely, the converse implication also holds.

For every $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we define $[x]=\\{y \\in \\mathbb{N}: x \\sim y\\}$; surely, $y_{1} \\sim y_{2}$ for all $y_{1}, y_{2} \\in[x]$, so $[x]=[y]$ whenever $y \\in[x]$.\n\nNow we investigate the structure of the sets $[x]$.\n\nClaim 1. Suppose that $f(x) \\sim f(y)$; then $x \\sim y$, that is, $f(x)=f(y)$.
