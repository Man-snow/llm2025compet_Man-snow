#Elements Identified#:  
- Variables: acute-angled triangle ABC, circumcircle Γ, incenter I, circles ω_B and ω_C tangent at I, points P (intersection of ω_B with shorter arc AB), M (intersection of ω_B with segment AB), Q (intersection of ω_C with shorter arc AC), N (intersection of ω_C with segment AC), rays PM and QN meeting at X, tangents to ω_B at B and ω_C at C meeting at Y.  
- Conditions: circles tangent at I and pass through B and C; P, M, Q, N defined via intersections; rays meeting; tangents meeting; collinearity of A, X, Y.  
- Actions: intersecting circles, defining rays and tangents, meeting points.  
- Theme: circle geometry involving tangency, intersections, and collinearity.  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
- Modify the triangle specification: Replace general acute-angled triangle with a specific coordinate-based triangle (A(0,0), B(6,0), C(3,4)) to enable computation and add coordinace calculation complexity.  
- Add constraint on circles: Specify that the common tangent at I is horizontal, uniquely determining ω_B and ω_C and increasing rigor in circle definition.  
- Transform proof to computation: Require calculation of a specific numerical value (distance XY) with exact expression, increasing complexity through multi-step coordinate geometry, intersection solving, and distance computation.

Preamble. Let $X=y \cap z, Y=x \cap z, Z=x \cap y$ and let $\Omega$ denote the circumcircle of the triangle $X Y Z$. Denote by $X_{0}, Y_{0}$, and $Z_{0}$ the second intersection points of $A I, B I$ and $C I$, respectively, with $\omega$. It is known that $Y_{0} Z_{0}$ is the perpendicular bisector of $A I, Z_{0} X_{0}$ is the perpendicular bisector of $B I$, and $X_{0} Y_{0}$ is the perpendicular bisector of $C I$. In particular, the triangles $X Y Z$ and $X_{0} Y_{0} Z_{0}$ are homothetic, because their corresponding sides are parallel.

The solutions below mostly exploit the following approach. Consider the triangles $X Y Z$ and $X_{0} Y_{0} Z_{0}$, or some other pair of homothetic triangles $\Delta$ and $\delta$ inscribed into $\Omega$ and $\omega$, respectively. In order to prove that $\Omega$ and $\omega$ are tangent, it suffices to show that the centre $T$ of the homothety taking $\Delta$ to $\delta$ lies on $\omega$ (or $\Omega$ ), or, in other words, to show that $\Delta$ and $\delta$ are perspective (i.e., the lines joining corresponding vertices are concurrent), with their perspector lying on $\omega$ (or $\Omega$ ).

Notice also that since $X D_{b}=X D=X D_{c}$, the points $D, D_{b}, D_{c}$ lie on a circle with centre $X$. Using in this circle the diameter $D_{c} D_{c}^{\\prime}$ yields $\\sphericalangle\\left(D_{b} D_{c}, D_{c} X\\right)=90^{\\circ}+\\sphericalangle\\left(D_{b} D_{c}^{\\prime}, D_{c}^{\\prime} X\\right)=90^{\\circ}+\\sphericalangle\\left(D_{b} D, D D_{c}\\right)$.

By a similar argument, $Y, Y_{0}, T$ and $Z, Z_{0}, T$ are collinear. As mentioned in the preamble, the statement of the problem follows.'
 'As mentioned in the preamble, it is sufficient to prove that the centre $T$ of the homothety taking $X Y Z$ to $X_{0} Y_{0} Z_{0}$ belongs to $\\omega$. Thus, it suffices to prove that $\\sphericalangle\\left(T X_{0}, T Y_{0}\\right)=$ $\\sphericalangle\\left(Z_{0} X_{0}, Z_{0} Y_{0}\\right)$, or, equivalently, $\\sphericalangle\\left(X X_{0}, Y Y_{0}\\right)=\\sphericalangle\\left(Z_{0} X_{0}, Z_{0} Y_{0}\\right)$.\n\nRecall that $Y Z$ and $Y_{0} Z_{0}$ are the perpendicular bisectors of $A D$ and $A I$, respectively. Then, the vector $\\vec{x}$ perpendicular to $Y Z$ and shifting the line $Y_{0} Z_{0}$ to $Y Z$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{2} \\overrightarrow{I D}$. Define the shifting vectors $\\vec{y}=\\frac{1}{2} \\overrightarrow{I E}, \\vec{z}=\\frac{1}{2} \\overrightarrow{I F}$ similarly. Consider now the triangle $U V W$ formed by the perpendiculars to $A I, B I$, and $C I$ through $D, E$, and $F$, respectively (see figure below). This is another triangle whose sides are parallel to the corresponding sides of $X Y Z$.\n\nClaim 2. $\\overrightarrow{I U}=2 \\overrightarrow{X_{0} X}, \\overrightarrow{I V}=2 \\overrightarrow{Y_{0} Y}, \\overrightarrow{I W}=2 \\overrightarrow{Z_{0} Z}$.\n\nProof. We prove one of the relations, the other proofs being similar. To prove the equality of two vectors it suffices to project them onto two non-parallel axes and check that their projections are equal.\n\nThe projection of $\\overrightarrow{X_{0} X}$ onto $I B$ equals $\\vec{y}$, while the projection of $\\overrightarrow{I U}$ onto $I B$ is $\\overrightarrow{I E}=2 \\vec{y}$. The projections onto the other axis $I C$ are $\\vec{z}$ and $\\overrightarrow{I F}=2 \\vec{z}$. Then $\\overrightarrow{I U}=2 \\overrightarrow{X_{0} X}$ follows.\n\nNotice that the line $\\ell$ is the Simson line of the point $I$ with respect to the triangle $U V W$; thus $U, V, W$, and $I$ are concyclic. It follows from Claim 2 that $\\sphericalangle\\left(X X_{0}, Y Y_{0}\\right)=\\sphericalangle(I U, I V)=$ $\\sphericalangle(W U, W V)=\\sphericalangle\\left(Z_{0} X_{0}, Z_{0} Y_{0}\\right)$, and we are done.\n\n<img_3588>'
 'Let $I_{a}, I_{b}$, and $I_{c}$ be the excentres of triangle $A B C$ corresponding to $A, B$, and $C$, respectively. Also, let $u, v$, and $w$ be the lines through $D, E$, and $F$ which are perpendicular to $A I, B I$, and $C I$, respectively, and let $U V W$ be the triangle determined by these lines, where $u=V W, v=U W$ and $w=U V$ (see figure above).\n\nNotice that the line $u$ is the reflection of $I_{b} I_{c}$ in the line $x$, because $u, x$, and $I_{b} I_{c}$ are perpendicular to $A D$ and $x$ is the perpendicular bisector of $A D$. Likewise, $v$ and $I_{a} I_{c}$ are reflections of each other in $y$, while $w$ and $I_{a} I_{b}$ are reflections of each other in $z$. It follows that $X, Y$, and $Z$ are the midpoints of $U I_{a}, V I_{b}$ and $W I_{c}$, respectively, and that the triangles $U V W$, $X Y Z$ and $I_{a} I_{b} I_{c}$ are either translates of each other or homothetic with a common homothety centre.\n\nConstruct the points $T$ and $S$ such that the quadrilaterals $U V I W, X Y T Z$ and $I_{a} I_{b} S I_{c}$ are homothetic. Then $T$ is the midpoint of $I S$. Moreover, note that $\\ell$ is the Simson line of the point $I$ with respect to the triangle $U V W$, hence $I$ belongs to the circumcircle of the triangle $U V W$, therefore $T$ belongs to $\\Omega$.\n\n\n\nConsider now the homothety or translation $h_{1}$ that maps $X Y Z T$ to $I_{a} I_{b} I_{c} S$ and the homothety $h_{2}$ with centre $I$ and factor $\\frac{1}{2}$. Furthermore, let $h=h_{2} \\circ h_{1}$. The transform $h$ can be a homothety or a translation, and\n\n$$\nh(T)=h_{2}\\left(h_{1}(T)\\right)=h_{2}(S)=T\n$$\n\nhence $T$ is a fixed point of $h$. So, $h$ is a homothety with centre $T$. Note that $h_{2}$ maps the excentres $I_{a}, I_{b}, I_{c}$ to $X_{0}, Y_{0}, Z_{0}$ defined in the preamble. Thus the centre $T$ of the homothety taking $X Y Z$ to $X_{0} Y_{0} Z_{0}$ belongs to $\\Omega$, and this completes the proof.']"

#Elements Identified#:
- Circumcenter \(O\) and circumcircle \(\Omega\) of acute-angled triangle \(ABC\).
- Arbitrary point \(P\) on \(\Omega\), distinct from \(A, B, C\), and their antipodes.
- Circumcenters \(O_A, O_B, O_C\) of triangles \(AOP, BOP, COP\).
- Lines \(\ell_A, \ell_B, \ell_C\) perpendicular to \(BC, CA, AB\) passing through \(O_A, O_B, O_C\).
- Triangle formed by the pairwise intersections of \(\ell_A, \ell_B, \ell_C\) (i.e., vertices at intersection points).
- Circumcircle of this triangle tangent to line \(OP\) (to be proven).
- Theme: Geometric properties of circumcenters, perpendicular lines, and tangency under circle geometry.

Key modifiable elements: 
- Generality of triangle \(ABC\) (angles can be specified).
- Position of point \(P\) (can be fixed numerically).
- Proof focus (can be shifted to computation of specific quantities like coordinates, distances).
- Rule to retain: Triangles acute-angled; points not antipodes; coherency of geometric constructions.

### Step 2
#Plan#:
1. **Concretize triangle:** Replace arbitrary acute-angled triangle with specific, non-symmetric angles \(A = 50^\circ\), \(B = 60^\circ\), \(C = 70^\circ\) and fixed circumradius \(R = 1\) to enable computation. Place \(O\) at \((0,0)\) and vertex \(A\) at \((1,0)\) for coordinate framework.
   - Why: Reduces free variables; adds numerical constraint; ensures calculation is non-trivial via scalene triangle with distinct angles.
2. **Specify point \(P\):** Fix \(P\) with angular position \(\phi = 30^\circ\) from the ray \(OA\) (reference direction) on \(\Omega\), instead of arbitrary. Check exclusion conditions: \(\phi \neq 0^\circ\) (A), \(140^\circ\) (B), \(240^\circ\) (C), \(180^\circ\) (antipode A), \(320^\circ\) (antipode B), \(60^\circ\) (antipode C), all clear as \(30^\circ\) distinct.
   - Why: Replaces generality with precise coordinate calculation; increases complexity through angular parameterization.
3. **Transform proof to computation:** 
   - Define computation objects: Calculate circumcenters \(O_A, O_B, O_C\) via coordinate geometry.
   - Find intersections of \(\ell_A, \ell_B, \ell_C\) to form triangle vertices \(Q_{AB}\) (int. \(\ell_A \cap \ell_B\)), \(Q_{BC}\) (\(\ell_B \cap \ell_C\)), \(Q_{CA}\) (\(\ell_C \cap \ell_A\)).
   - Compute circumcircle of \(\Delta Q_{AB}Q_{BC}Q_{CA}\) (center and radius).
   - Instead of proving tangency to \(OP\), compute the exact distance from \(O\) to the tangency point \(T\) on \(OP\) as the specific output.
   - Why: Shifts from verification to intensive calculation; outputs numerical value (e.g., distance OT) requiring solving equations, circle-line tangency, and distance formulas.
4. **Ensure coherence:** All elements retained with logical dependency—positions define circumcenters, which define perpendicular lines, then intersections, circumcircle, and tangency point for OP. Added constraints (angles, R=1, fixed P angle) increase reasoning steps but maintain theme. Output is a scalar (distance OT), specific and computable with coordinate geometry.
5. **Complexity increase:** New difficulty from multi-step coordinate computations (multiple circumcenters, line intersections, circumcircle solving), fixed parameters disallow shortcuts, and numerical output demands precision.

**#Elements Identified#**:
- Sequence definition: \(a_n = 2^n + 2^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}\) for non-negative integers \(n\).
- Property under focus: Whether a term \(a_n\) can be expressed as a sum of two or more distinct terms from the sequence (excluding itself).
- Core concept: Analysis of when \(a_n\) is representable or not using such sums, leading to infinite cases for both possibilities.
- Variables: The index \(n\), and implicitly the terms \(a_k\).
- Existing structure: A proof argument establishing infinitude for both classes (representable or not) through binary or combinatorial properties.
- Theme: Study of the sequence's additive properties with respect to sums of its own terms.

### Step 2
**#Plan#**:
1. **Change from proof to computation**: Instead of proving the existence of infinitely many representable and non-representable terms, compute a specific numerical value related to the non-representable terms. This creates a computational challenge requiring exact output.
2. **Add parameters and constraints**: Introduce a large parameter \(N\) and ask for the number of non-representable terms up to \(N\). To increase complexity, set \(N = 2^{20}\), a computationally large value that cannot be directly brute-forced, and demand modulo reduction to focus on residual properties.
3. **Incorporate modulation**: Require the result modulo 1000 to enforce efficiency, leveraging properties like binary representations or periodicity to derive a formula or pattern for faster computation.
4. **Increase reasoning depth**: Connect to concepts such as binary digit sums or index parity by noting that the sequence terms have specific bit patterns. This requires insights into when \(a_n\) is uniquely expressed (simplifying the non-representable count).
5. **Maintain logical connections**: Ensure the sequence definition and sum conditions remain central. The condition ""distinct terms with indices not equal to \(n\)"" is inherent but clarified for precision. No new variables are introduced without purpose—\(N\) directly scales the problem, and modulo 1000 applies a real-world computational constraint.

### Step 3
**#Rewritten Instruction#**:

In particular, $S_{2 k-1}=2^{2 k}+2^{k+1}-3$.\n\nNote that, if $n \\geqslant 3$, then $2^{[n / 2]} \\geqslant 2^{2}>3$, so\n\n$$\nS_{n-1}=2^{n}+2^{\\lceil n / 2\\rceil}+2^{\\lfloor n / 2\\rfloor}-3>2^{n}+2^{\\lfloor n / 2\\rfloor}=a_{n} .\n$$\n\nAlso notice that $S_{n-1}-a_{n}=2^{[n / 2]}-3<a_{n}$.\n\nThe main tool of the solution is the following claim.\n\nClaim 1. Assume that $b$ is a positive integer such that $S_{n-1}-a_{n}<b<a_{n}$ for some $n \\geqslant 3$. Then $b \\sim S_{n-1}-b$.\n\nProof. As seen above, we have $S_{n-1}>a_{n}$. Denote $c=S_{n-1}-b$; then $S_{n-1}-a_{n}<c<a_{n}$, so the roles of $b$ and $c$ are symmetrical.\n\nAssume that $b$ is representable. The representation cannot contain $a_{i}$ with $i \\geqslant n$, since $b<a_{n}$. So $b$ is the sum of some subset of $\\left\\{a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n-1}\\right\\}$; then $c$ is the sum of the complement. The converse is obtained by swapping $b$ and $c$.\n\nWe also need the following version of this claim.\n\nClaim 2. For any $n \\geqslant 3$, the number $a_{n}$ can be represented as a sum of two or more distinct terms of the sequence if and only if $S_{n-1}-a_{n}=2^{[n / 2]}-3$ is representable.\n\nProof. Denote $c=S_{n-1}-a_{n}<a_{n}$. If $a_{n}$ satisfies the required condition, then it is the sum of some subset of $\\left\\{a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n-1}\\right\\}$; then $c$ is the sum of the complement. Conversely, if $c$ is representable, then its representation consists only of the numbers from $\\left\\{a_{0}, \\ldots, a_{n-1}\\right\\}$, so $a_{n}$ is the sum of the complement.\n\nBy Claim 2, in order to prove the problem statement, it suffices to find infinitely many representable numbers of the form $2^{t}-3$, as well as infinitely many non-representable ones.\n\nClaim 3. For every $t \\geqslant 3$, we have $2^{t}-3 \\sim 2^{4 t-6}-3$, and $2^{4 t-6}-3>2^{t}-3$.\n\nProof. The inequality follows from $t \\geqslant 3$. In order to prove the equivalence, we apply Claim 1 twice in the following manner.\n\nFirst, since $S_{2 t-3}-a_{2 t-2}=2^{t-1}-3<2^{t}-3<2^{2 t-2}+2^{t-1}=a_{2 t-2}$, by Claim 1 we have $2^{t}-3 \\sim S_{2 t-3}-\\left(2^{t}-3\\right)=2^{2 t-2}$.\n\nSecond, since $S_{4 t-7}-a_{4 t-6}=2^{2 t-3}-3<2^{2 t-2}<2^{4 t-6}+2^{2 t-3}=a_{4 t-6}$, by Claim 1 we have $2^{2 t-2} \\sim S_{4 t-7}-2^{2 t-2}=2^{4 t-6}-3$.\n\nTherefore, $2^{t}-3 \\sim 2^{2 t-2} \\sim 2^{4 t-6}-3$, as required.\n\nNow it is easy to find the required numbers. Indeed, the number $2^{3}-3=5=a_{0}+a_{1}$ is representable, so Claim 3 provides an infinite sequence of representable numbers\n\n$$\n2^{3}-3 \\sim 2^{6}-3 \\sim 2^{18}-3 \\sim \\cdots \\sim 2^{t}-3 \\sim 2^{4 t-6}-3 \\sim \\cdots\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, the number $2^{7}-3=125$ is non-representable (since by Claim 1 we have $125 \\sim S_{6}-125=24 \\sim S_{4}-24=17 \\sim S_{3}-17=4$ which is clearly non-representable). So Claim 3 provides an infinite sequence of non-representable numbers\n\n$$\n2^{7}-3 \\sim 2^{22}-3 \\sim 2^{82}-3 \\sim \\cdots \\sim 2^{t}-3 \\sim 2^{4 t-6}-3 \\sim \\cdots\n$$'
 'We keep the notion of representability and the notation $S_{n}$ from the previous solution. We say that an index $n$ is good if $a_{n}$ writes as a sum of smaller terms from the sequence $a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots$ Otherwise we say it is bad. We must prove that there are infinitely many good indices, as well as infinitely many bad ones.\n\nLemma 1. If $m \\geqslant 0$ is an integer, then $4^{m}$ is representable if and only if either of $2 m+1$ and $2 m+2$ is good.\n\nProof. The case $m=0$ is obvious, so we may assume that $m \\geqslant 1$. Let $n=2 m+1$ or $2 m+2$. Then $n \\geqslant 3$. We notice that\n\n$$\nS_{n-1}<a_{n-2}+a_{n}\n$$\n\nThe inequality writes as $2^{n}+2^{[n / 2]}+2^{\\lfloor n / 2\\rfloor}-3<2^{n}+2^{\\lfloor n / 2\\rfloor}+2^{n-2}+2^{\\lfloor n / 2\\rfloor-1}$, i.e. as $2^{[n / 2\\rceil}<$ $2^{n-2}+2^{\\lfloor n / 2\\rfloor-1}+3$. If $n \\geqslant 4$, then $n / 2 \\leqslant n-2$, so $[n / 2\\rceil \\leqslant n-2$ and $2^{[n / 2\\rfloor} \\leqslant 2^{n-2}$. For $n=3$ the inequality verifies separately.\n\nIf $n$ is good, then $a_{n}$ writes as $a_{n}=a_{i_{1}}+\\cdots+a_{i_{r}}$, where $r \\geqslant 2$ and $i_{1}<\\cdots<i_{r}<n$. Then $i_{r}=n-1$ and $i_{r-1}=n-2$, for if $n-1$ or $n-2$ is missing from the sequence $i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{r}$, then $a_{i_{1}}+\\cdots+a_{i_{r}} \\leqslant a_{0}+\\cdots+a_{n-3}+a_{n-1}=S_{n-1}-a_{n-2}<a_{n}$. Thus, if $n$ is good, then both $a_{n}-a_{n-1}$ and $a_{n}-a_{n-1}-a_{n-2}$ are representable.\n\nWe now consider the cases $n=2 m+1$ and $n=2 m+2$ separately.\n\nIf $n=2 m+1$, then $a_{n}-a_{n-1}=a_{2 m+1}-a_{2 m}=\\left(2^{2 m+1}+2^{m}\\right)-\\left(2^{2 m}+2^{m}\\right)=2^{2 m}$. So we proved that, if $2 m+1$ is good, then $2^{2 m}$ is representable. Conversely, if $2^{2 m}$ is representable, then $2^{2 m}<a_{2 m}$, so $2^{2 m}$ is a sum of some distinct terms $a_{i}$ with $i<2 m$. It follows that $a_{2 m+1}=a_{2 m}+2^{2 m}$ writes as $a_{2 m}$ plus a sum of some distinct terms $a_{i}$ with $i<2 m$. Hence $2 m+1$ is good.\n\nIf $n=2 m+2$, then $a_{n}-a_{n-1}-a_{n-2}=a_{2 m+2}-a_{2 m+1}-a_{2 m}=\\left(2^{2 m+2}+2^{m+1}\\right)-\\left(2^{2 m+1}+\\right.$ $\\left.2^{m}\\right)-\\left(2^{2 m}+2^{m}\\right)=2^{2 m}$. So we proved that, if $2 m+2$ is good, then $2^{2 m}$ is representable. Conversely, if $2^{2 m}$ is representable, then, as seen in the previous case, it writes as a sum of some distinct terms $a_{i}$ with $i<2 m$. Hence $a_{2 m+2}=a_{2 m+1}+a_{2 m}+2^{2 m}$ writes as $a_{2 m+1}+a_{2 m}$ plus a sum of some distinct terms $a_{i}$ with $i<2 m$. Thus $2 m+2$ is good.\n\nLemma 2. If $k \\geqslant 2$, then $2^{4 k-2}$ is representable if and only if $2^{k+1}$ is representable.\n\nIn particular, if $s \\geqslant 2$, then $4^{s}$ is representable if and only if $4^{4 s-3}$ is representable. Also, $4^{4 s-3}>4^{s}$.\n\nProof. We have $2^{4 k-2}<a_{4 k-2}$, so in a representation of $2^{4 k-2}$ we can have only terms $a_{i}$ with $i \\leqslant 4 k-3$. Notice that\n\n$$\na_{0}+\\cdots+a_{4 k-3}=2^{4 k-2}+2^{2 k}-3<2^{4 k-2}+2^{2 k}+2^{k}=2^{4 k-2}+a_{2 k} .\n$$\n\nHence, any representation of $2^{4 k-2}$ must contain all terms from $a_{2 k}$ to $a_{4 k-3}$. (If any of these terms is missing, then the sum of the remaining ones is $\\leqslant\\left(a_{0}+\\cdots+a_{4 k-3}\\right)-a_{2 k}<2^{4 k-2}$.) Hence, if $2^{4 k-2}$ is representable, then $2^{4 k-2}-\\sum_{i=2 k}^{4 k-3} a_{i}$ is representable. But\n\n$2^{4 k-2}-\\sum_{i=2 k}^{4 k-3} a_{i}=2^{4 k-2}-\\left(S_{4 k-3}-S_{2 k-1}\\right)=2^{4 k-2}-\\left(2^{4 k-2}+2^{2 k}-3\\right)+\\left(2^{2 k}+2^{k+1}-3\\right)=2^{k+1}$.\n\nSo, if $2^{4 k-2}$ is representable, then $2^{k+1}$ is representable. Conversely, if $2^{k+1}$ is representable, then $2^{k+1}<2^{2 k}+2^{k}=a_{2 k}$, so $2^{k+1}$ writes as a sum of some distinct terms $a_{i}$ with $i<2 k$. It follows that $2^{4 k-2}=\\sum_{i=2 k}^{4 k-3} a_{i}+2^{k+1}$ writes as $a_{4 k-3}+a_{4 k-4}+\\cdots+a_{2 k}$ plus the sum of some distinct terms $a_{i}$ with $i<2 k$. Hence $2^{4 k-2}$ is representable.\n\nFor the second statement, if $s \\geqslant 2$, then we just take $k=2 s-1$ and we notice that $2^{k+1}=4^{s}$ and $2^{4 k-2}=4^{4 s-3}$. Also, $s \\geqslant 2$ implies that $4 s-3>s$.\n\nNow $4^{2}=a_{2}+a_{3}$ is representable, whereas $4^{6}=4096$ is not. Indeed, note that $4^{6}=2^{12}<a_{12}$, so the only available terms for a representation are $a_{0}, \\ldots, a_{11}$, i.e., $2,3,6,10,20,36,72$, 136, 272, 528, 1056, 2080. Their sum is $S_{11}=4221$, which exceeds 4096 by 125 . Then any representation of 4096 must contain all the terms from $a_{0}, \\ldots, a_{11}$ that are greater that 125, i.e., $136,272,528,1056,2080$. Their sum is 4072 . Since $4096-4072=24$ and 24 is clearly not representable, 4096 is non-representable as well.\n\nStarting with these values of $m$, by using Lemma 2, we can obtain infinitely many representable powers of 4 , as well as infinitely many non-representable ones. By Lemma 1, this solves our problem.']"

There are finitely many such primes; therefore, it suffices to prove that the exponent of each of them in the prime factorization of $a_{n}$ is eventually constant.\n\nChoose any prime $p \\mid a_{1} a_{k}$.

If the set $S_{m}$ is infinite, then $S_{m}=\\{d, 2 d, 3 d, \\ldots\\}=d \\cdot \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ for some positive integer $d$. Proof. Let $d=\\min S_{m}$; the definition of $S_{m}$ yields $m \\mid f(d)$.\n\nWhenever $n \\in S_{m}$ and $n>d$, we have $m|f(n)| f(n-d)+f(d)$, so $m \\mid f(n-d)$ and therefore $n-d \\in S_{m}$. Let $r \\leqslant d$ be the least positive integer with $n \\equiv r(\\bmod d)$; repeating the same step, we can see that $n-d, n-2 d, \\ldots, r \\in S_{m}$. By the minimality of $d$, this shows $r=d$ and therefore $d \\mid n$.\n\nStarting from an arbitrarily large element of $S_{m}$, the process above reaches all multiples of $d$; so they all are elements of $S_{m}$.\n\nThe solution for the problem will be split into two cases.\n\nCase 1: The function $f$ is bounded.\n\nCall a prime $p$ frequent if the set $S_{p}$ is infinite, i.e., if $p$ divides $f(n)$ for infinitely many positive integers $n$; otherwise call $p$ sporadic. Since the function $f$ is bounded, there are only a finite number of primes that divide at least one $f(n)$; so altogether there are finitely many numbers $n$ such that $f(n)$ has a sporadic prime divisor. Let $N$ be a positive integer, greater than all those numbers $n$.\n\nLet $p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{k}$ be the frequent primes. By the lemma we have $S_{p_{i}}=d_{i} \\cdot \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ for some $d_{i}$. Consider the number\n\n$$\nn=N d_{1} d_{2} \\cdots d_{k}+1\n$$\n\nDue to $n>N$, all prime divisors of $f(n)$ are frequent primes. Let $p_{i}$ be any frequent prime divisor of $f(n)$. Then $n \\in S_{p_{i}}$, and therefore $d_{i} \\mid n$. But $n \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod d_{i}\\right)$, which means $d_{i}=1$. Hence $S_{p_{i}}=1 \\cdot \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}=\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ and therefore $p_{i}$ is a common divisor of all values $f(n)$.\n\nCase 2: $f$ is unbounded.\n\nWe prove that $f(1)$ divides all $f(n)$.\n\nLet $a=f(1)$. Since $1 \\in S_{a}$, by the lemma it suffices to prove that $S_{a}$ is an infinite set.\n\nCall a positive integer $p$ a peak if $f(p)>\\max (f(1), \\ldots, f(p-1))$. Since $f$ is not bounded, there are infinitely many peaks. Let $1=p_{1}<p_{2}<\\ldots$ be the sequence of all peaks, and let $h_{k}=f\\left(p_{k}\\right)$. Notice that for any peak $p_{i}$ and for any $k<p_{i}$, we have $f\\left(p_{i}\\right) \\mid f(k)+f\\left(p_{i}-k\\right)<$ $2 f\\left(p_{i}\\right)$, hence\n\n$$\nf(k)+f\\left(p_{i}-k\\right)=f\\left(p_{i}\\right)=h_{i} .\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nBy the pigeonhole principle, among the numbers $h_{1}, h_{2}, \\ldots$ there are infinitely many that are congruent modulo $a$. Let $k_{0}<k_{1}<k_{2}<\\ldots$ be an infinite sequence of positive integers such that $h_{k_{0}} \\equiv h_{k_{1}} \\equiv \\ldots(\\bmod a)$. Notice that\n\n$$\nf\\left(p_{k_{i}}-p_{k_{0}}\\right)=f\\left(p_{k_{i}}\\right)-f\\left(p_{k_{0}}\\right)=h_{k_{i}}-h_{k_{0}} \\equiv 0 \\quad(\\bmod a),\n$$\n\nso $p_{k_{i}}-p_{k_{0}} \\in S_{a}$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots$ This provides infinitely many elements in $S_{a}$.\n\nHence, $S_{a}$ is an infinite set, and therefore $f(1)=a$ divides $f(n)$ for every $n$.'
 ""Let $d_{n}=\\operatorname{gcd}(f(n), f(1))$. From $d_{n+1} \\mid f(1)$ and $d_{n+1}|f(n+1)| f(n)+f(1)$, we can see that $d_{n+1} \\mid f(n)$; then $d_{n+1} \\mid \\operatorname{gcd}(f(n), f(1))=d_{n}$. So the sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots$ is nonincreasing in the sense that every element is a divisor of the previous elements. Let $d=\\min \\left(d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots\\right)=\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(d_{1} \\cdot d_{2}, \\ldots\\right)=\\operatorname{gcd}(f(1), f(2), \\ldots)$; we have to prove $d \\geqslant 2$.\n\nFor the sake of contradiction, suppose that the statement is wrong, so $d=1$; that means there is some index $n_{0}$ such that $d_{n}=1$ for every $n \\geqslant n_{0}$, i.e., $f(n)$ is coprime with $f(1)$.\n\nClaim 1. If $2^{k} \\geqslant n_{0}$ then $f\\left(2^{k}\\right) \\leqslant 2^{k}$.\n\nProof. By the condition, $f(2 n) \\mid 2 f(n)$; a trivial induction yields $f\\left(2^{k}\\right) \\mid 2^{k} f(1)$. If $2^{k} \\geqslant n_{0}$ then $f\\left(2^{k}\\right)$ is coprime with $f(1)$, so $f\\left(2^{k}\\right)$ is a divisor of $2^{k}$.\n\nClaim 2. There is a constant $C$ such that $f(n)<n+C$ for every $n$.\n\nProof. Take the first power of 2 which is greater than or equal to $n_{0}$ : let $K=2^{k} \\geqslant n_{0}$. By Claim 1, we have $f(K) \\leqslant K$. Notice that $f(n+K) \\mid f(n)+f(K)$ implies $f(n+K) \\leqslant$ $f(n)+f(K) \\leqslant f(n)+K$. If $n=t K+r$ for some $t \\geqslant 0$ and $1 \\leqslant r \\leqslant K$, then we conclude\n\n$f(n) \\leqslant K+f(n-K) \\leqslant 2 K+f(n-2 K) \\leqslant \\ldots \\leqslant t K+f(r)<n+\\max (f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(K))$,\n\nso the claim is true with $C=\\max (f(1), \\ldots, f(K))$.\n\nClaim 3.

Let $d=\\operatorname{gcd}(f(a), f(b))$. We can replicate Euclid's algorithm. Formally, apply induction on $a+b$. If $a=1$ or $b=1$ then we already have $d \\mid f(1)$.\n\nWithout loss of generality, suppose $1<a<b$. Then $d \\mid f(a)$ and $d|f(b)| f(a)+f(b-a)$, so $d \\mid f(b-a)$. Therefore $d$ divides $\\operatorname{gcd}(f(a), f(b-a))$ which is a divisor of $f(1)$ by the induction hypothesis.\n\nLet $p_{1}<p_{2}<\\ldots$ be the sequence of all prime numbers; for every $k$, let $q_{k}$ be the lowest power of $p_{k}$ with $q_{k} \\geqslant n_{0}$.

Hence, $\\max \\left(f(1), f\\left(q_{1}\\right), \\ldots, f\\left(q_{N}\\right)\\right) \\geqslant p_{N+1}$.\n\nChoose $N$ such that $\\max \\left(q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{N}\\right)=p_{N}$ (this is achieved if $N$ is sufficiently large), and $p_{N+1}-p_{N}>C$ (that is possible, because there are arbitrarily long gaps between the primes).

**Step 1**  
#Elements Identified#:  
- **Variables**: The integer \(n \geq 2018\), and sequences \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\), \(b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n\) of positive integers.  
- **Conditions**: All \(a_i\) and \(b_i\) are pairwise distinct and bounded by \(5n\). The sequence of fractions \(\frac{a_i}{b_i}\) forms an arithmetic progression.  
- **Action**: Prove that the terms of the sequence (the fractions) are equal.  
- **Theme**: Arithmetic progression of fractions with integer constraints, leading to a rigidity property (equality for large \(n\)).  
- **Structure**: A proof-based instruction focusing on logical deduction from constraints.  

**Step 2**  
#Plan#:  
1. **Modify the bound**: Change the upper limit from \(5n\) to \(4n\) to allow non-constant arithmetic progressions for large \(n\), increasing challenge by making the constraint tighter and enabling computational complexity.  
2. **Add reduced fractions constraint**: Require \(\gcd(a_i, b_i) = 1\) for all \(i\) to ensure fractions are in lowest terms, introducing number-theoretic complexity and avoiding trivial constant sequences (since \(n > 1\) and reduced fractions imply non-constant terms).  
3. **Transform to computational problem**: Replace ""prove equality"" with ""compute the number of valid tuples forming an AP"", demanding a specific numerical output (a count) that requires enumeration under stricter constraints, thus increasing difficulty.  
4. **Ensure logical integration**: The new elements (tighter bound, gcd condition) are linked to the AP condition and distinctness constraint, creating a non-trivial counting problem involving combinatorics and number theory. The bound \(4n\) is lower than \(5n\), so non-constant APs exist for large \(n\), and the gcd condition excludes constant sequences, forcing d≠0.

For any prime $p$, all $p$-wrong indices are congruent modulo $p$. In other words, the $p$-wrong indices (if they exist) are included in an arithmetic progression with difference $p$.\n\nProof.

**#Elements Identified#:**
- Set size: 2000 distinct real numbers.
- Pairs: Defined by \( a > b \) and \( c > d \), with the condition \( a \neq c \) or \( b \neq d \) to ensure the pairs are not identical, but allowing shared elements.
- Inequality: Involves the expression \( \left| \frac{a - b}{c - d} - 1 \right| < \frac{1}{100000} \).
- Core concept and theme: Demonstrating the existence of two pairs with nearly equal differences using combinatorial reasoning (e.g., pigeonhole principle) under a fixed small tolerance. The theme revolves around near-equal differences in pairs from the set, with tolerance \(\epsilon = \frac{1}{100000}\).

### Step 2
**#Plan#:**
1. **Increase set size**: Replace the fixed size of 2000 with \( n = 500000 \) (a large number to make computation intensive) to amplify complexity.
2. **Make pairs disjoint**: Require that the pairs \( (a, b) \) and \( (c, d) \) share no common elements (i.e., \( a, b, c, d \) all distinct), increasing the constraint and difficulty compared to the original which allowed overlapping pairs.
3. **Reduce tolerance**: Halve the tolerance to \(\epsilon = \frac{1}{200000}\) (\(\sim 5 \times 10^{-6}\)) to force finer granularity and require more sensitive computation.
4. **Transform to computational problem**: Instead of proving existence, ask for the minimal \( n \) ensuring existence for the given \(\epsilon\). This requires deriving \( n \) from combinatorial bounds or approximations, involving logarithmic growth and inequalities, making it a non-trivial calculation.
5. **Ensure logical interconnection**: The disjoint pair requirement links to the tolerance reduction, as it necessitates a larger set to guarantee existence of such pairs under tighter bounds. The theme of near-equal differences remains consistent.
6. **Complexity justification**: Increasing size and decreasing tolerance leverage the pigeonhole principle's sensitivity to these parameters; computing \( n \) involves solving inequalities with variables, adding real-world constraints (e.g., worst-case geometric progressions for differences).

2065,"A crazy physicist discovered a new kind of particle which he called an imon, after some of them mysteriously appeared in his lab. Some pairs of imons in the lab can be entangled, and each imon can participate in many entanglement relations. The physicist has found a way to perform the following two kinds of operations with these particles, one operation at a time.

(i) If some imon is entangled with an odd number of other imons in the lab, then the physicist can destroy it.

(ii) At any moment, he may double the whole family of imons in his lab by creating a copy $I^{\prime}$ of each imon $I$. During this procedure, the two copies $I^{\prime}$ and $J^{\prime}$ become entangled if and only if the original imons $I$ and $J$ are entangled, and each copy $I^{\prime}$ becomes entangled with its original imon $I$; no other entanglements occur or disappear at this moment.

Prove that the physicist may apply a sequence of such operations resulting in a family of imons, no two of which are entangled.","**  
A physicist has \(n\) imons in a complete graph with all pairs entangled.

Given integers \(n \geq 1\) and \(c \geq 0\), determine the minimum possible number of imons that can remain in a state with no entanglements, using a sequence of operations that minimizes total cost.","**Step 1**  
**#Elements Identified#:**  
- **Entities**: Imons (vertices) and entanglements (edges forming a graph).  
- **Operations**:  
  - (i) Destroy an imon with an odd number of entanglements (removes vertex of odd degree).  
  - (ii) Double all imons (duplicates graph, adding edges between each original and its copy, and between copies iff originals were entangled).  
- **Conditions**: Destroy requires odd degree; double operation preserves existing edge structure and adds new edges based on originals.  
- **Goal**: Achieve a state with no entanglements (edgeless graph).  
- **Core Concept**: Graph transformation using degree-based removal and duplication.  
- **Theme**: Graph theory, with operations diagonalizable over GF(2) via adjacency matrix.  
- **Original Structure**: Existence proof requiring sequence construction. Complexity to increase via specific computation.  

**Step 2**  
**#Plan#:**  
- **Modify Initial State**: Define a concrete, highly symmetric starting graph: a complete graph \(K_n\) with \(n\) imons (all \(\binom{n}{2}\) pairs entangled). This introduces a variable \(n\), making the problem parameter-dependent.  
- **Expand Operations**: Add costs: Operation (i) costs \(1\) unit; operation (ii) costs \(c\) units (parameter \(c\)), so minimizing total cost adds optimization over sequences. Dependency: Cost \(c\) affects strategy (e.g., double when cheap).  
- **Add Constraint and Goal**: Target cannot have entanglements, but compute min possible number of imons at end (isolated vertices). This depends on sequence and must be minimized for added complexity, as size varies (destroy reduces count, double increases it).  
- **Enhance Complexity**: For \(K_n\), min final size is non-trivial due to graph symmetry, but complicates with cost-minimization trade-off (e.g., doubling grows size but may reduce subsequent operations). Ensure variables \(n\) and \(c\) are inputs; answer can be a formula or computational result for large \(n\).  
- **Maintain Theme**: Coherent by keeping all graph-theoretic elements, adding numeric objectives. Avoid unnecessary variables; ensure hardness through optimization and parameters.

Recall that a proper coloring of a graph $G$ is a coloring of its vertices in several colors so that every two connected vertices have different colors.\n\nLemma. Assume that a graph $G$ admits a proper coloring in $n$ colors $(n>1)$. Then one may perform a sequence of operations resulting in a graph which admits a proper coloring in $n-1$ colors.\n\nProof. Let us apply repeatedly operation (i) to any appropriate vertices while it is possible. Since the number of vertices decreases, this process finally results in a graph where all the degrees are even. Surely this graph also admits a proper coloring in $n$ colors $1, \\ldots, n$; let us fix this coloring.\n\nNow apply the operation (ii) to this graph. A proper coloring of the resulting graph in $n$ colors still exists: one may preserve the colors of the original vertices and color the vertex $I^{\\prime}$ in a color $k+1(\\bmod n)$ if the vertex $I$ has color $k$. Then two connected original vertices still have different colors, and so do their two connected copies. On the other hand, the vertices $I$ and $I^{\\prime}$ have different colors since $n>1$.\n\nAll the degrees of the vertices in the resulting graph are odd, so one may apply operation $(i)$ to delete consecutively all the vertices of color $n$ one by one; no two of them are connected by an edge, so their degrees do not change during the process. Thus, we obtain a graph admitting a proper coloring in $n-1$ colors, as required. The lemma is proved.\n\nNow, assume that a graph $G$ has $n$ vertices; then it admits a proper coloring in $n$ colors. Applying repeatedly the lemma we finally obtain a graph admitting a proper coloring in one color, that is - a graph with no edges, as required.'
 'Again, we will use the graph language.\n\nI. We start with the following observation.\n\nLemma. Assume that a graph $G$ contains an isolated vertex $A$, and a graph $G^{\\circ}$ is obtained from $G$ by deleting this vertex. Then, if one can apply a sequence of operations which makes a graph with no edges from $G^{\\circ}$, then such a sequence also exists for $G$.\n\nProof. Consider any operation applicable to $G^{\\circ}$ resulting in a graph $G_{1}^{\\circ}$; then there exists a sequence of operations applicable to $G$ and resulting in a graph $G_{1}$ differing from $G_{1}^{\\circ}$ by an addition of an isolated vertex $A$. Indeed, if this operation is of type $(i)$, then one may simply repeat it in $G$.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, the operation is of type (ii), and one may apply it to $G$ and then delete the vertex $A^{\\prime}$ (it will have degree 1).\n\nThus one may change the process for $G^{\\circ}$ into a corresponding process for $G$ step by step.\n\nIn view of this lemma, if at some moment a graph contains some isolated vertex, then we may simply delete it; let us call this operation (iii).\n\nII. Let $V=\\left\\{A_{1}^{0}, \\ldots, A_{n}^{0}\\right\\}$ be the vertices of the initial graph. Let us describe which graphs can appear during our operations. Assume that operation (ii) was applied $m$ times. If these were the only operations applied, then the resulting graph $G_{n}^{m}$ has the set of vertices which can be enumerated as\n\n$$\nV_{n}^{m}=\\left\\{A_{i}^{j}: 1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n, 0 \\leqslant j \\leqslant 2^{m}-1\\right\\},\n$$\n\nwhere $A_{i}^{0}$ is the common ""ancestor"" of all the vertices $A_{i}^{j}$, and the binary expansion of $j$ (adjoined with some zeroes at the left to have $m$ digits) ""keeps the history"" of this vertex: the $d$ th digit from the right is 0 if at the $d$ th doubling the ancestor of $A_{i}^{j}$ was in the original part, and this digit is 1 if it was in the copy.\n\nNext, the two vertices $A_{i}^{j}$ and $A_{k}^{\\ell}$ in $G_{n}^{m}$ are connected with an edge exactly if either (1) $j=\\ell$ and there was an edge between $A_{i}^{0}$ and $A_{k}^{0}$ (so these vertices appeared at the same application of operation (ii)); or (2) $i=k$ and the binary expansions of $j$ and $\\ell$ differ in exactly one digit (so their ancestors became connected as a copy and the original vertex at some application of $(i i))$.\n\nNow, if some operations $(i)$ were applied during the process, then simply some vertices in $G_{n}^{m}$ disappeared. So, in any case the resulting graph is some induced subgraph of $G_{n}^{m}$.\n\nIII. Finally, we will show that from each (not necessarily induced) subgraph of $G_{n}^{m}$ one can obtain a graph with no vertices by applying operations $(i),($ ii) and (iii). We proceed by induction on $n$; the base case $n=0$ is trivial.\n\nFor the induction step, let us show how to apply several operations so as to obtain a graph containing no vertices of the form $A_{n}^{j}$ for $j \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. We will do this in three steps.\n\nStep 1. We apply repeatedly operation $(i)$ to any appropriate vertices while it is possible. In the resulting graph, all vertices have even degrees.\n\nStep 2. Apply operation (ii) obtaining a subgraph of $G_{n}^{m+1}$ with all degrees being odd. In this graph, we delete one by one all the vertices $A_{n}^{j}$ where the sum of the binary digits of $j$ is even; it is possible since there are no edges between such vertices, so all their degrees remain odd. After that, we delete all isolated vertices.\n\nStep 3. Finally, consider any remaining vertex $A_{n}^{j}$ (then the sum of digits of $j$ is odd). If its degree is odd, then we simply delete it. Otherwise, since $A_{n}^{j}$ is not isolated, we consider any vertex adjacent to it. It has the form $A_{k}^{j}$ for some $k<n$ (otherwise it would have the form $A_{n}^{\\ell}$, where $\\ell$ has an even digit sum; but any such vertex has already been deleted at Step 2). No neighbor of $A_{k}^{j}$ was deleted at Steps 2 and 3, so it has an odd degree. Then we successively delete $A_{k}^{j}$ and $A_{n}^{j}$.\n\nNotice that this deletion does not affect the applicability of this step to other vertices, since no two vertices $A_{i}^{j}$ and $A_{k}^{\\ell}$ for different $j, \\ell$ with odd digit sum are connected with an edge. Thus we will delete all the remaining vertices of the form $A_{n}^{j}$, obtaining a subgraph of $G_{n-1}^{m+1}$. The application of the induction hypothesis finishes the proof.']"

To prove the first claim, let us notice that there exists an infinite sequence of indices $k_{1}=k, k_{2}, k_{3}, \\ldots$ such that $b_{k_{1}}=b_{k_{2}}=\\cdots=b_{k}$ and $k_{i}<k_{i+1} \\leqslant k_{i}+r$ for all $i \\geqslant 1$.

Let us apply the first claim to $k=i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{r+1}$ and $\\ell=\\max \\left\\{i_{1}, \\ldots, i_{r+1}\\right\\}$; we obtain that for every $j \\in\\{1, \\ldots, r+1\\}$ there exists $t_{j} \\in[s, s+r-1]$ such that $b_{t_{j}}=b_{i_{j}}$.

Denote by $A_{i}$ the ordered $r$-tuple $\\left(a_{i}, \\ldots, a_{i+r-1}\\right)$; then among $A_{i}$ 's there are at most $r^{r}$ distinct tuples, so for every $k \\geqslant 0$ two of the tuples $A_{k}, A_{k+1}, \\ldots, A_{k+r^{r}}$ are identical.

The sequence $b_{0}, b_{1}, \\ldots$ satisfies the lemma conditions, so there exists an index $t \\in[d+1, d+r]$ such that $S(t, t+p)=S(d, d+p)$. This last relation rewrites as $S(d, t)=S(d+p, t+p)$.

#Elements Identified#:  
- Vertices (cities) and edges (direct two-way flights) form a connected, undirected graph.  
- Distance defined as shortest path length.  
- Constraint: For each vertex, the number of vertices at distance exactly \(d\) is at most \(K\) (with \(d=3\), \(K=100\) in original).  
- Original proof goal: Bound the number of vertices at distance exactly four from any vertex (to at most 2550 for \(d=3, K=100\)).  
- Theme: Graph distance properties, extremal bounds on neighborhood sizes.  

**Step 2**  
#Plan#:  
- Change distance constraint: From fixed distance (3) to variable \(d\), and set \(d=3\) but extend the target to a larger distance (e.g., \(d+k\) with \(k>1\)) to increase reasoning steps. Specifically, use \(k=2\) so target is distance \(d+2\) (i.e., 5 for \(d=3\)).  
- Introduce additional constraint: Add girth constraint (girth \(\geq 6\)) to prohibit small cycles, tightening the bound and requiring combinatorial optimization under restricted structures. This eliminates low-diameter configurations that might inflate counts artificially.  
- Make computational: Instead of proving a bound, seek the supremum (over all graphs and vertices) of the number at distance exactly \(d+2\), for fixed parameters. Set \(d=3\), \(K=100\) to demand a numerical answer.

- Variables: \( n \), circular arrangements of numbers \(0\) to \(n\), the number \(M\) of beautiful arrangements, and the number \(N\) of coprime pairs \((x, y)\) satisfying \(x + y \leq n\) and \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
- Condition for beautiful arrangements: for any four distinct numbers \(0 \leq a, b, c, d \leq n\) with \(a + c = b + d\), the chord joining \(a\) and \(c\) does not intersect the chord joining \(b\) and \(d\).
- Theme: combinatorial enumeration involving circular arrangements, chord intersections, and coprimality.
- Process: Prove that \(M = N + 1\) for any \(n \geq 2\).

Step 2
#Plan#:
- Change the condition for beautiful arrangements: the equation \(a + c = b + d\) is replaced with the congruence \(a + c \equiv b + d \pmod{n+1}\) to require more constraints and break the existing formula.
- Concretize \(n\): specify a large fixed value (\(n = 20\)) to shift from a proof to computation and make enumeration non-trivial.
- Increase difficulty: the stronger congruence condition expands the set of quadruples that must not intersect, making the count more complex and removing the relation to \(N\). Ask for the number of arrangements modulo-beautiful for \(n = 20\), which requires computational effort.
- Maintain logical connectivity: the core concept of circular arrangements and chord non-intersection remains, preserving the theme while adding combinatorially meaningful depth.

Compute the number of modulo-beautiful arrangements.",success,362.83,"['Given a circular arrangement of $[0, n]=\\{0,1, \\ldots, n\\}$, we define a $k$-chord to be a (possibly degenerate) chord whose (possibly equal) endpoints add up to $k$. We say that three chords of a circle are aligned if one of them separates the other two. Say that $m \\geqslant 3$ chords are aligned if any three of them are aligned. For instance, in Figure 1, $A, B$, and $C$ are aligned, while $B, C$, and $D$ are not.\n\n<img_4048>\n\nFigure 1\n\n<img_3890>\n\nFigure 2\n\nClaim. In a beautiful arrangement, the $k$-chords are aligned for any integer $k$.\n\nProof. We proceed by induction. For $n \\leqslant 3$ the statement is trivial. Now let $n \\geqslant 4$, and proceed by contradiction. Consider a beautiful arrangement $S$ where the three $k$-chords $A, B, C$ are not aligned. If $n$ is not among the endpoints of $A, B$, and $C$, then by deleting $n$ from $S$ we obtain a beautiful arrangement $S \\backslash\\{n\\}$ of $[0, n-1]$, where $A, B$, and $C$ are aligned by the induction hypothesis. Similarly, if 0 is not among these endpoints, then deleting 0 and decreasing all the numbers by 1 gives a beautiful arrangement $S \\backslash\\{0\\}$ where $A, B$, and $C$ are aligned. Therefore both 0 and $n$ are among the endpoints of these segments. If $x$ and $y$ are their respective partners, we have $n \\geqslant 0+x=k=n+y \\geqslant n$. Thus 0 and $n$ are the endpoints of one of the chords; say it is $C$.\n\nLet $D$ be the chord formed by the numbers $u$ and $v$ which are adjacent to 0 and $n$ and on the same side of $C$ as $A$ and $B$, as shown in Figure 2. Set $t=u+v$. If we had $t=n$, the $n-$ chords $A$, $B$, and $D$ would not be aligned in the beautiful arrangement $S \\backslash\\{0, n\\}$, contradicting the induction hypothesis. If $t<n$, then the $t$-chord from 0 to $t$ cannot intersect $D$, so the chord $C$ separates $t$ and $D$. The chord $E$ from $t$ to $n-t$ does not intersect $C$, so $t$ and $n-t$ are on the same side of $C$. But then the chords $A, B$, and $E$ are not aligned in $S \\backslash\\{0, n\\}$, a contradiction. Finally, the case $t>n$ is equivalent to the case $t<n$ via the beauty-preserving relabelling $x \\mapsto n-x$ for $0 \\leqslant x \\leqslant n$, which sends $t$-chords to $(2 n-t)$-chords. This proves the Claim.\n\nHaving established the Claim, we prove the desired result by induction. The case $n=2$ is trivial. Now assume that $n \\geqslant 3$. Let $S$ be a beautiful arrangement of $[0, n]$ and delete $n$ to obtain\n\n\n\nthe beautiful arrangement $T$ of $[0, n-1]$. The $n$-chords of $T$ are aligned, and they contain every point except 0 . Say $T$ is of Type 1 if 0 lies between two of these $n$-chords, and it is of Type 2 otherwise; i.e., if 0 is aligned with these $n$-chords. We will show that each Type 1 arrangement of $[0, n-1]$ arises from a unique arrangement of $[0, n]$, and each Type 2 arrangement of $[0, n-1]$ arises from exactly two beautiful arrangements of $[0, n]$.\n\nIf $T$ is of Type 1, let 0 lie between chords $A$ and $B$. Since the chord from 0 to $n$ must be aligned with $A$ and $B$ in $S, n$ must be on the other arc between $A$ and $B$. Therefore $S$ can be recovered uniquely from $T$. In the other direction, if $T$ is of Type 1 and we insert $n$ as above, then we claim the resulting arrangement $S$ is beautiful. For $0<k<n$, the $k$-chords of $S$ are also $k$-chords of $T$, so they are aligned. Finally, for $n<k<2 n$, notice that the $n$-chords of $S$ are parallel by construction, so there is an antisymmetry axis $\\ell$ such that $x$ is symmetric to $n-x$ with respect to $\\ell$ for all $x$. If we had two $k$-chords which intersect, then their reflections across $\\ell$ would be two $(2 n-k)$-chords which intersect, where $0<2 n-k<n$, a contradiction.\n\nIf $T$ is of Type 2, there are two possible positions for $n$ in $S$, on either side of 0 . As above, we check that both positions lead to beautiful arrangements of $[0, n]$.\n\nHence if we let $M_{n}$ be the number of beautiful arrangements of $[0, n]$, and let $L_{n}$ be the number of beautiful arrangements of $[0, n-1]$ of Type 2 , we have\n\n$$\nM_{n}=\\left(M_{n-1}-L_{n-1}\\right)+2 L_{n-1}=M_{n-1}+L_{n-1} \\text {. }\n$$\n\nIt then remains to show that $L_{n-1}$ is the number of pairs $(x, y)$ of positive integers with $x+y=n$ and $\\operatorname{gcd}(x, y)=1$. Since $n \\geqslant 3$, this number equals $\\varphi(n)=\\#\\{x: 1 \\leqslant x \\leqslant n, \\operatorname{gcd}(x, n)=1\\}$.\n\nTo prove this, consider a Type 2 beautiful arrangement of $[0, n-1]$. Label the positions $0, \\ldots, n-1(\\bmod n)$ clockwise around the circle, so that number 0 is in position 0 . Let $f(i)$ be the number in position $i$; note that $f$ is a permutation of $[0, n-1]$. Let $a$ be the position such that $f(a)=n-1$.\n\nSince the $n$-chords are aligned with 0 , and every point is in an $n$-chord, these chords are all parallel and\n\n$$\nf(i)+f(-i)=n \\quad \\text { for all } i\n$$\n\nSimilarly, since the $(n-1)$-chords are aligned and every point is in an $(n-1)$-chord, these chords are also parallel and\n\n$$\nf(i)+f(a-i)=n-1 \\quad \\text { for all } i \\text {. }\n$$\n\nTherefore $f(a-i)=f(-i)-1$ for all $i$; and since $f(0)=0$, we get\n\n$$\nf(-a k)=k \\quad \\text { for all } k \\text {. }\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nRecall that this is an equality modulo $n$. Since $f$ is a permutation, we must have $(a, n)=1$. Hence $L_{n-1} \\leqslant \\varphi(n)$.\n\nTo prove equality, it remains to observe that the labeling (1) is beautiful. To see this, consider four numbers $w, x, y, z$ on the circle with $w+y=x+z$. Their positions around the circle satisfy $(-a w)+(-a y)=(-a x)+(-a z)$, which means that the chord from $w$ to $y$ and the chord from $x$ to $z$ are parallel. Thus (1) is beautiful, and by construction it has Type 2. The desired result follows.'
 'Notice that there are exactly $N$ irreducible fractions $f_{1}<\\cdots<f_{N}$ in $(0,1)$ whose denominator is at most $n$, since the pair $(x, y)$ with $x+y \\leqslant n$ and $(x, y)=1$ corresponds to the fraction $x /(x+y)$. Write $f_{i}=\\frac{a_{i}}{b_{i}}$ for $1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant N$.\n\nWe begin by constructing $N+1$ beautiful arrangements. Take any $\\alpha \\in(0,1)$ which is not one of the above $N$ fractions. Consider a circle of perimeter 1 . Successively mark points $0,1,2, \\ldots, n$ where 0 is arbitrary, and the clockwise distance from $i$ to $i+1$ is $\\alpha$. The point $k$ will be at clockwise distance $\\{k \\alpha\\}$ from 0 , where $\\{r\\}$ denotes the fractional part of $r$. Call such a circular arrangement cyclic and denote it by $A(\\alpha)$. If the clockwise order of the points is the same in $A\\left(\\alpha_{1}\\right)$ and $A\\left(\\alpha_{2}\\right)$, we regard them as the same circular arrangement. Figure 3 shows the cyclic arrangement $A(3 / 5+\\epsilon)$ of $[0,13]$ where $\\epsilon>0$ is very small.\n\n<img_3809>\n\nFigure 3\n\nIf $0 \\leqslant a, b, c, d \\leqslant n$ satisfy $a+c=b+d$, then $a \\alpha+c \\alpha=b \\alpha+d \\alpha$, so the chord from $a$ to $c$ is parallel to the chord from $b$ to $d$ in $A(\\alpha)$. Hence in a cyclic arrangement all $k$-chords are parallel. In particular every cyclic arrangement is beautiful.\n\nNext we show that there are exactly $N+1$ distinct cyclic arrangements. To see this, let us see how $A(\\alpha)$ changes as we increase $\\alpha$ from 0 to 1 . The order of points $p$ and $q$ changes precisely when we cross a value $\\alpha=f$ such that $\\{p f\\}=\\{q f\\}$; this can only happen if $f$ is one of the $N$ fractions $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{N}$. Therefore there are at most $N+1$ different cyclic arrangements.\n\nTo show they are all distinct, recall that $f_{i}=a_{i} / b_{i}$ and let $\\epsilon>0$ be a very small number. In the arrangement $A\\left(f_{i}+\\epsilon\\right)$, point $k$ lands at $\\frac{k a_{i}\\left(\\bmod b_{i}\\right)}{b_{i}}+k \\epsilon$. Therefore the points are grouped into $b_{i}$ clusters next to the points $0, \\frac{1}{b_{i}}, \\ldots, \\frac{b_{i}-1}{b_{i}}$ of the circle. The cluster following $\\frac{k}{b_{i}}$ contains the numbers congruent to $k a_{i}^{-1}$ modulo $b_{i}$, listed clockwise in increasing order. It follows that the first number after 0 in $A\\left(f_{i}+\\epsilon\\right)$ is $b_{i}$, and the first number after 0 which is less than $b_{i}$ is $a_{i}^{-1}\\left(\\bmod b_{i}\\right)$, which uniquely determines $a_{i}$. In this way we can recover $f_{i}$ from the cyclic arrangement. Note also that $A\\left(f_{i}+\\epsilon\\right)$ is not the trivial arrangement where we list $0,1, \\ldots, n$ in order clockwise. It follows that the $N+1$ cyclic arrangements $A(\\epsilon), A\\left(f_{1}+\\epsilon\\right), \\ldots, A\\left(f_{N}+\\epsilon\\right)$ are distinct.\n\nLet us record an observation which will be useful later:\n\n$$\n\\text { if } f_{i}<\\alpha<f_{i+1} \\text { then } 0 \\text { is immediately after } b_{i+1} \\text { and before } b_{i} \\text { in } A(\\alpha) \\text {. }\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nIndeed, we already observed that $b_{i}$ is the first number after 0 in $A\\left(f_{i}+\\epsilon\\right)=A(\\alpha)$. Similarly we see that $b_{i+1}$ is the last number before 0 in $A\\left(f_{i+1}-\\epsilon\\right)=A(\\alpha)$.\n\n\n\nFinally, we show that any beautiful arrangement of $[0, n]$ is cyclic by induction on $n$. For $n \\leqslant 2$ the result is clear. Now assume that all beautiful arrangements of $[0, n-1]$ are cyclic, and consider a beautiful arrangement $A$ of $[0, n]$. The subarrangement $A_{n-1}=A \\backslash\\{n\\}$ of $[0, n-1]$ obtained by deleting $n$ is cyclic; say $A_{n-1}=A_{n-1}(\\alpha)$.\n\nLet $\\alpha$ be between the consecutive fractions $\\frac{p_{1}}{q_{1}}<\\frac{p_{2}}{q_{2}}$ among the irreducible fractions of denominator at most $n-1$. There is at most one fraction $\\frac{i}{n}$ in $\\left(\\frac{p_{1}}{q_{1}}, \\frac{p_{2}}{q_{2}}\\right)$, since $\\frac{i}{n}<\\frac{i}{n-1} \\leqslant \\frac{i+1}{n}$ for $0<i \\leqslant n-1$.\n\nCase 1. There is no fraction with denominator $n$ between $\\frac{p_{1}}{q_{1}}$ and $\\frac{p_{2}}{q_{2}}$.\n\nIn this case the only cyclic arrangement extending $A_{n-1}(\\alpha)$ is $A_{n}(\\alpha)$. We know that $A$ and $A_{n}(\\alpha)$ can only differ in the position of $n$. Assume $n$ is immediately after $x$ and before $y$ in $A_{n}(\\alpha)$. Since the neighbors of 0 are $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ by (2), we have $x, y \\geqslant 1$.\n\n<img_3352>\n\nFigure 4\n\nIn $A_{n}(\\alpha)$ the chord from $n-1$ to $x$ is parallel and adjacent to the chord from $n$ to $x-1$, so $n-1$ is between $x-1$ and $x$ in clockwise order, as shown in Figure 4. Similarly, $n-1$ is between $y$ and $y-1$. Therefore $x, y, x-1, n-1$, and $y-1$ occur in this order in $A_{n}(\\alpha)$ and hence in $A$ (possibly with $y=x-1$ or $x=y-1$ ).\n\nNow, $A$ may only differ from $A_{n}(\\alpha)$ in the location of $n$. In $A$, since the chord from $n-1$ to $x$ and the chord from $n$ to $x-1$ do not intersect, $n$ is between $x$ and $n-1$. Similarly, $n$ is between $n-1$ and $y$. Then $n$ must be between $x$ and $y$ and $A=A_{n}(\\alpha)$. Therefore $A$ is cyclic as desired.\n\nCase 2. There is exactly one $i$ with $\\frac{p_{1}}{q_{1}}<\\frac{i}{n}<\\frac{p_{2}}{q_{2}}$.\n\nIn this case there exist two cyclic arrangements $A_{n}\\left(\\alpha_{1}\\right)$ and $A_{n}\\left(\\alpha_{2}\\right)$ of the numbers $0, \\ldots, n$ extending $A_{n-1}(\\alpha)$, where $\\frac{p_{1}}{q_{1}}<\\alpha_{1}<\\frac{i}{n}$ and $\\frac{i}{n}<\\alpha_{2}<\\frac{p_{2}}{q_{2}}$. In $A_{n-1}(\\alpha), 0$ is the only number between $q_{2}$ and $q_{1}$ by (2). For the same reason, $n$ is between $q_{2}$ and 0 in $A_{n}\\left(\\alpha_{1}\\right)$, and between 0 and $q_{1}$ in $A_{n}\\left(\\alpha_{2}\\right)$.\n\nLetting $x=q_{2}$ and $y=q_{1}$, the argument of Case 1 tells us that $n$ must be between $x$ and $y$ in $A$. Therefore $A$ must equal $A_{n}\\left(\\alpha_{1}\\right)$ or $A_{n}\\left(\\alpha_{2}\\right)$, and therefore it is cyclic.\n\nThis concludes the proof that every beautiful arrangement is cyclic. It follows that there are exactly $N+1$ beautiful arrangements of $[0, n]$ as we wished to show.']"

#Plan#:  
1. Shift the space from the unit interval \([0,1]\) to the \(d\)-dimensional unit cube \([0,1]^d\), increasing dimensionality and modifying ink requirements per move. Use \(d = 2\) for the computational problem.  
2. Replace the fixed initial ink with a variable \(V\) (initial ink) and introduce a variable \(d\) (dimension). For the computational problem, set \(d = 2\) and variable \(V\), asking for the minimal \(V\) where player A cannot win.  
3. Adjust ink provision and covering: To cover a dyadic cube of side \(2^{-m}\) in \([0,1]^d\), the ink required is \((2^{-m})^d = 2^{-m \cdot d}\) units. Player A provides exactly this ink per move, and player B blackens such a dyadic cube.

Let $m$ be the integer picked by player $A$ in this round; we define an integer $y_{r}$ by\n\n$$\n\\frac{y_{r}}{2^{m}} \\leqslant x_{r}<\\frac{y_{r}+1}{2^{m}}\n$$\n\nNote that $I_{0}^{r}=\\left[y_{r} / 2^{m},\\left(y_{r}+1\\right) / 2^{m}\\right]$ is the leftmost interval that may be painted in round $r$ and that still contains some uncolored point.\n\nPlayer $B$ now looks at the next interval $I_{1}^{r}=\\left[\\left(y_{r}+1\\right) / 2^{m},\\left(y_{r}+2\\right) / 2^{m}\\right]$. If $I_{1}^{r}$ still contains an uncolored point, then player $B$ blackens the interval $I_{1}^{r}$; otherwise he blackens the interval $I_{0}^{r}$. We make the convention that, at the beginning of the game, the interval $[1,2]$ is already blackened; thus, if $y_{r}+1=2^{m}$, then $B$ blackens $I_{0}^{r}$.\n\nOur aim is to estimate the amount of ink used after each round. Firstly, we will prove by induction that, if before $r$ th round the segment $[0,1]$ is not completely colored, then, before this move,\n\n(i) the amount of ink used for the segment $\\left[0, x_{r}\\right]$ is at most $3 x_{r}$; and\n\n(ii) for every $m, B$ has blackened at most one interval of length $1 / 2^{m}$ to the right of $x_{r}$.\n\nObviously, these conditions are satisfied for $r=0$. Now assume that they were satisfied before the $r$ th move, and consider the situation after this move; let $m$ be the number $A$ has picked at this move.\n\nIf $B$ has blackened the interval $I_{1}^{r}$ at this move, then $x_{r+1}=x_{r}$, and $(i)$ holds by the induction hypothesis. Next, had $B$ blackened before the $r$ th move any interval of length $1 / 2^{m}$ to the right of $x_{r}$, this interval would necessarily coincide with $I_{1}^{r}$. By our strategy, this cannot happen. So, condition (ii) also remains valid.\n\nAssume now that $B$ has blackened the interval $I_{0}^{r}$ at the $r$ th move, but the interval $[0,1]$ still contains uncolored parts (which means that $I_{1}^{r}$ is contained in $[0,1]$ ). Then condition (ii) clearly remains true, and we need to check $(i)$ only. In our case, the intervals $I_{0}^{r}$ and $I_{1}^{r}$ are completely colored after the $r$ th move, so $x_{r+1}$ either reaches the right endpoint of $I_{1}$ or moves even further to the right. So, $x_{r+1}=x_{r}+\\alpha$ for some $\\alpha>1 / 2^{m}$.\n\nNext, any interval blackened by $B$ before the $r$ th move which intersects $\\left(x_{r}, x_{r+1}\\right)$ should be contained in $\\left[x_{r}, x_{r+1}\\right]$; by (ii), all such intervals have different lengths not exceeding $1 / 2^{m}$, so the total amount of ink used for them is less than $2 / 2^{m}$. Thus, the amount of ink used for the segment $\\left[0, x_{r+1}\\right]$ does not exceed the sum of $2 / 2^{m}, 3 x_{r}$ (used for $\\left[0, x_{r}\\right]$ ), and $1 / 2^{m}$ used for the\n\n\n\nsegment $I_{0}^{r}$. In total it gives at most $3\\left(x_{r}+1 / 2^{m}\\right)<3\\left(x_{r}+\\alpha\\right)=3 x_{r+1}$. Thus condition $(i)$ is also verified in this case. The claim is proved.\n\nFinally, we can perform the desired estimation. Consider any situation in the game, say after the $(r-1)$ st move; assume that the segment $[0,1]$ is not completely black. By $(i i)$, in the segment $\\left[x_{r}, 1\\right]$ player $B$ has colored several segments of different lengths; all these lengths are negative powers of 2 not exceeding $1-x_{r}$; thus the total amount of ink used for this interval is at most $2\\left(1-x_{r}\\right)$. Using $(i)$, we obtain that the total amount of ink used is at most $3 x_{r}+2\\left(1-x_{r}\\right)<3$. Thus the pot is not empty, and therefore $A$ never wins.']"

- **Modify position of \(W\)**: Set \(W\) as the foot of the altitude from \(A\) to \(BC\), adding dependency on the orthocenter and increasing geometric constraints.  
- **Change action to computational task**: Require computation of the distance between \(X\) and \(Y\) instead of proving collinearity. This involves calculating coordinates, circumradii, and vector operations.  
- **Increase complexity**: Introduce irrational coordinates (due to side lengths) and detailed steps for finding \(H\), \(M\), \(N\), \(\omega_1\), \(\omega_2\), \(X\), \(Y\), ensuring non-trivial algebra and numerical evaluation.

Denote the midpoint of the $\\operatorname{arc} C B$ of $\\Omega$ containing $A$ by $A_{0}$, and define $B_{0}$ as well as $C_{0}$ analogously. By our hypothesis the centre $Q$ of $\\Gamma$ lies on $\\Omega$.\n\nLemma. One has $A_{0} B_{1}=A_{0} C_{1}$. Moreover, the points $A, A_{0}, B_{1}$, and $C_{1}$ are concyclic. Finally, the points $A$ and $A_{0}$ lie on the same side of $B_{1} C_{1}$. Similar statements hold for $B$ and $C$.\n\nProof. Let us consider the case $A=A_{0}$ first. Then the triangle $A B C$ is isosceles at $A$, which implies $A B_{1}=A C_{1}$ while the remaining assertions of the Lemma are obvious. So let us suppose $A \\neq A_{0}$ from now on.\n\nBy the definition of $A_{0}$, we have $A_{0} B=A_{0} C$. It is also well known and easy to show that $B C_{1}=$ $C B_{1}$. Next, we have $\\angle C_{1} B A_{0}=\\angle A B A_{0}=\\angle A C A_{0}=\\angle B_{1} C A_{0}$. Hence the triangles $A_{0} B C_{1}$ and $A_{0} C B_{1}$ are congruent. This implies $A_{0} C_{1}=A_{0} B_{1}$, establishing the first part of the Lemma. It also follows that $\\angle A_{0} C_{1} A=\\angle A_{0} B_{1} A$, as these are exterior angles at the corresponding vertices $C_{1}$ and $B_{1}$ of the congruent triangles $A_{0} B C_{1}$ and $A_{0} C B_{1}$. For that reason the points $A, A_{0}, B_{1}$, and $C_{1}$ are indeed the vertices of some cyclic quadrilateral two opposite sides of which are $A A_{0}$ and $B_{1} C_{1}$.\n\nNow we turn to the solution. Evidently the points $A_{1}, B_{1}$, and $C_{1}$ lie interior to some semicircle arc of $\\Gamma$, so the triangle $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ is obtuse-angled. Without loss of generality, we will assume that its angle at $B_{1}$ is obtuse. Thus $Q$ and $B_{1}$ lie on different sides of $A_{1} C_{1}$; obviously, the same holds for the points $B$ and $B_{1}$. So, the points $Q$ and $B$ are on the same side of $A_{1} C_{1}$.\n\nNotice that the perpendicular bisector of $A_{1} C_{1}$ intersects $\\Omega$ at two points lying on different sides of $A_{1} C_{1}$. By the first statement from the Lemma, both points $B_{0}$ and $Q$ are among these points of intersection; since they share the same side of $A_{1} C_{1}$, they coincide (see Figure 1).\n\n<img_3398>\n\nFigure 1\n\n\n\nNow, by the first part of the Lemma again, the lines $Q A_{0}$ and $Q C_{0}$ are the perpendicular bisectors of $B_{1} C_{1}$ and $A_{1} B_{1}$, respectively. Thus\n\n$$\n\\angle C_{1} B_{0} A_{1}=\\angle C_{1} B_{0} B_{1}+\\angle B_{1} B_{0} A_{1}=2 \\angle A_{0} B_{0} B_{1}+2 \\angle B_{1} B_{0} C_{0}=2 \\angle A_{0} B_{0} C_{0}=180^{\\circ}-\\angle A B C,\n$$\n\nrecalling that $A_{0}$ and $C_{0}$ are the midpoints of the $\\operatorname{arcs} C B$ and $B A$, respectively.\n\nOn the other hand, by the second part of the Lemma we have\n\n$$\n\\angle C_{1} B_{0} A_{1}=\\angle C_{1} B A_{1}=\\angle A B C .\n$$\n\nFrom the last two equalities, we get $\\angle A B C=90^{\\circ}$, whereby the problem is solved.'
 'Let $Q$ again denote the centre of the circumcircle of the triangle $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$, that lies on the circumcircle $\\Omega$ of the triangle $A B C$. We first consider the case where $Q$ coincides with one of the vertices of $A B C$, say $Q=B$. Then $B C_{1}=B A_{1}$ and consequently the triangle $A B C$ is isosceles at $B$. Moreover we have $B C_{1}=B_{1} C$ in any triangle, and hence $B B_{1}=B C_{1}=B_{1} C$; similarly, $B B_{1}=B_{1} A$. It follows that $B_{1}$ is the centre of $\\Omega$ and that the triangle $A B C$ has a right angle at $B$.\n\nSo from now on we may suppose $Q \\notin\\{A, B, C\\}$. We start with the following well known fact. Lemma. Let $X Y Z$ and $X^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}$ be two triangles with $X Y=X^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime}$ and $Y Z=Y^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}$.\n\n(i) If $X Z \\neq X^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}$ and $\\angle Y Z X=\\angle Y^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime} X^{\\prime}$, then $\\angle Z X Y+\\angle Z^{\\prime} X^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime}=180^{\\circ}$.\n\n(ii) If $\\angle Y Z X+\\angle X^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime} Y^{\\prime}=180^{\\circ}$, then $\\angle Z X Y=\\angle Y^{\\prime} X^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}$.\n\nProof. For both parts, we may move the triangle $X Y Z$ through the plane until $Y=Y^{\\prime}$ and $Z=Z^{\\prime}$. Possibly after reflecting one of the two triangles about $Y Z$, we may also suppose that $X$ and $X^{\\prime}$ lie on the same side of $Y Z$ if we are in case $(i)$ and on different sides if we are in case (ii). In both cases, the points $X, Z$, and $X^{\\prime}$ are collinear due to the angle condition (see Fig. 2). Moreover we have $X \\neq X^{\\prime}$, because in case $(i)$ we assumed $X Z \\neq X^{\\prime} Z^{\\prime}$ and in case $(i i)$ these points even lie on different sides of $Y Z$. Thus the triangle $X X^{\\prime} Y$ is isosceles at $Y$. The claim now follows by considering the equal angles at its base.\n\n<img_3275>\n\nFigure $2(i)$\n\n<img_3630>\n\nFigure $2($ ii $)$\n\nRelabeling the vertices of the triangle $A B C$ if necessary we may suppose that $Q$ lies in the interior of the arc $A B$ of $\\Omega$ not containing $C$. We will sometimes use tacitly that the six triangles $Q B A_{1}, Q A_{1} C, Q C B_{1}, Q B_{1} A, Q C_{1} A$, and $Q B C_{1}$ have the same orientation.\n\nAs $Q$ cannot be the circumcentre of the triangle $A B C$, it is impossible that $Q A=Q B=Q C$ and thus we may also suppose that $Q C \\neq Q B$. Now the above Lemma $(i)$ is applicable to the triangles $Q B_{1} C$ and $Q C_{1} B$, since $Q B_{1}=Q C_{1}$ and $B_{1} C=C_{1} B$, while $\\angle B_{1} C Q=\\angle C_{1} B Q$ holds as both angles appear over the same side of the chord $Q A$ in $\\Omega$ (see Fig. 3). So we get\n\n$$\n\\angle C Q B_{1}+\\angle B Q C_{1}=180^{\\circ}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\n\n\nWe claim that $Q C=Q A$. To see this, let us assume for the sake of a contradiction that $Q C \\neq Q A$. Then arguing similarly as before but now with the triangles $Q A_{1} C$ and $Q C_{1} A$ we get\n\n$$\n\\angle A_{1} Q C+\\angle C_{1} Q A=180^{\\circ} .\n$$\n\nAdding this equation to (1), we get $\\angle A_{1} Q B_{1}+\\angle B Q A=360^{\\circ}$, which is absurd as both summands lie in the interval $\\left(0^{\\circ}, 180^{\\circ}\\right)$.\n\nThis proves $Q C=Q A$; so the triangles $Q A_{1} C$ and $Q C_{1} A$ are congruent their sides being equal, which in turn yields\n\n$$\n\\angle A_{1} Q C=\\angle C_{1} Q A .\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nFinally our Lemma ( $i i$ i) is applicable to the triangles $Q A_{1} B$ and $Q B_{1} A$. Indeed we have $Q A_{1}=Q B_{1}$ and $A_{1} B=B_{1} A$ as usual, and the angle condition $\\angle A_{1} B Q+\\angle Q A B_{1}=180^{\\circ}$ holds as $A$ and $B$ lie on different sides of the chord $Q C$ in $\\Omega$. Consequently we have\n\n$$\n\\angle B Q A_{1}=\\angle B_{1} Q A .\n\\tag{3}\n$$\n\nFrom (1) and (3) we get\n\n$$\n\\left(\\angle B_{1} Q C+\\angle B_{1} Q A\\right)+\\left(\\angle C_{1} Q B-\\angle B Q A_{1}\\right)=180^{\\circ},\n$$\n\ni.e. $\\angle C Q A+\\angle A_{1} Q C_{1}=180^{\\circ}$. In light of (2) this may be rewritten as $2 \\angle C Q A=180^{\\circ}$ and as $Q$ lies on $\\Omega$ this implies that the triangle $A B C$ has a right angle at $B$.\n\n<img_3157>\n\nFigure 3']"

The key elements are: fixed positive integers \(k\) and \(n\); a set of \(k\) unknown positive integers \(m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_k\); the equation involving exponentials and products; and the requirement to prove existence for all such pairs. The core concept is the decomposition of a rational expression into a product of terms of the form \(1 + \frac{1}{m_i}\). The theme revolves around multiplicative number theory and integer constraints.

Step 2
#Plan#:
To transform the proof problem into a harder computational one:
- Specify large, fixed values for \(k\) and \(n\) to necessitate non-trivial computation: set \(k=100\) and \(n=120135781\) (a large prime to avoid simplifications).
- Instead of proving existence, require computation of a specific numerical value: the minimum possible value of \(\sum_{i=1}^{k} m_i\) under the constraint that all \(m_i\) are distinct primes (adds complexity via primality testing).
- Introduce an optimization goal with a constraint, demanding algorithmic insight for large parameters and ensuring interconnectedness through the prime constraint and minimization.
- Maintain the original theme but increase difficulty via numerical computation, distinctness, primality, and optimization.

Prove that, if $S$ is an exciting set of $m \geq 4$ positive integers, then $S$ contains an integer greater than or equal to $\frac{m^{2}-m}{4}$.",Extraction Failed,"### Response to User Query

**Step 1: Elements Identified**
- Variables: $m$ (number of elements, with $m \geq 4$), the set $S$ containing $m$ distinct positive integers.
- Conditions: $S$ is ""boring"" if there exist four distinct integers $a, b, c, d \in S$ such that $a + b = c + d$; $S$ is ""exciting"" otherwise.
- Derived Condition: For exciting $S$, the maximum element must be at least $\frac{m^{2}-m}{4}$.
- Theme: Extremal set theory focusing on avoiding additive relations; properties can be naturally extended to multiplicative relations to increase complexity.
- Participants/Actions: Proving a lower bound on the maximum element; this can be evolved into a computational problem by introducing additional constraints (e.g., multiplicative avoidance), seeking an exact minimum value, and specifying a large $m$.

**Step 2: Plan**
1. **Increase Complexity via Additional Constraints**:
   - Introduce a multiplicative condition: Require $S$ to also avoid four distinct elements $a,b,c,d$ with $a \times b = c \times d$ (product-""boring""; otherwise product-""exciting""). This combines additive and multiplicative combinatorics, creating a ""doubly exciting"" set.
   - This extension connects the problem to sum-product estimates, a deeper area in number theory, making computations non-trivial.
2. **Evolve from Proof to Computational Problem**:
   - Replace the proof objective with finding a specific numerical value: the minimum possible maximum element (denoted $N$) over all doubly exciting sets of size $m$.
   - Specify $m$ concretely: Set $m = 10$ to make the computation challenging (e.g., requires constructing sets or leveraging known bounds, as exact values are hard for larger $m$), avoiding small/trivial cases.
3. **Ensure Coherence and Justification**:
   - The multiplicative constraint is integrated seamlessly with the original additive theme, preserving the dependence on distinct elements and extremal aspects. Parameters are self-explanatory (e.g., $m$ is given, and $N$ is to be computed).
4. **Objective**: The computational question demands the exact value of $N$ for $m = 10$, ensuring complexity through combinatorial explosion in the search space for valid sets.

**Step 3: Rewritten Instruction**
For $m = 10$, compute the minimum integer $N$ such that there exists a set $S$ of $m$ distinct positive integers with $\max(S) \leq N$, and $S$ is exciting (no distinct $a,b,c,d$ with $a + b = c + d$) and product-exciting (no distinct $a,b,c,d$ with $a \times b = c \times d$).

**Step 4: Finally Rewritten Instruction**
For $m = 10$, find the smallest integer $N$ for which a set of $10$ distinct positive integers, all $\leq N$, has no four distinct elements satisfying $a+b=c+d$ or $a \times b = c \times d$.",success,234.63,"['Suppose that $S$ is an exciting set that contains exactly $m$ elements.\n\nThere are $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}m \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right)=\\frac{m(m-1)}{2}$ pairs of elements of $S$.\n\nSince $S$ is exciting, the sums of these pairs of elements are all distinct positive integers.\n\nThis means that the largest of these sums is greater than or equal to $\\frac{m(m-1)}{2}$.\n\nWhen two numbers add to $\\frac{m(m-1)}{2}$ or greater, then at least one of them must be at least as large as $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{m(m-1)}{2}=\\frac{m^{2}-m}{4}$.\n\nTherefore, there is an element of $S$ that is greater than or equal to $\\frac{m^{2}-m}{4}$.']"

#Elements Identified#:
*   **Participants:** Quadrilateral ABCD, circumscribed circle, sides AB, AD, CD, BC, angles ∠ABC, ∠BAD.
*   **Relations:** Cyclic quadrilateral, given lengths (AB = AD = 1, CD = cos∠ABC), trigonometric condition (cos∠BAD = -1/3), diameter implication (BC to prove).
*   **Core Concept:** Using given side lengths, angles, and trigonometric identities under the cyclic quadrilateral constraint to prove a specific geometric property (diameter).
*   **Manipulable Elements:** Coefficient in angle cosine, side length values/givens, symmetry between sides, whether cyclicity is a given or to be shown, what quantity to compute (replace 'prove').

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Break Symmetry & Introduce Variables:** Replace the symmetric conditions `AB = AD = 1` with distinct variable lengths `AB = p`, `AD = q` where `p > q > 0`. This removes the isosceles simplification present in the proof.
2.  **Parameterize Constraint:** Replace the fixed trigonometric condition `\\cos \\angle BAD = -1/3` with a negative parameter `\\cos \\angle BAD = -k` (`k > 0`). This introduces an arbitrary parameter `k`, making the solution depend on its value.
3.  **Shift Requirement to Computation & Hide Cyclicity:** The goal will become *computing* the length of BC under the condition that BC *is* a diameter. However, instead of being given the quadrilateral is cyclic, *require verifying that it must be cyclic when BC is a diameter*, implicitly making cyclicity part of the solution path. The final answer *BC* will be expressed in terms of `p`, `q`, and `k`. This combines the proof aspect (cyclicity when BC=diameter) with a specific computation.
4.  **Concretize with Values:** Assign specific values to the introduced parameters `p`, `q`, and `k` (`p > q > 0`, `k > 0`) for the final computational task. Choose values avoiding simplifications (e.g., rational).
5.  **Target Output:** The instruction will require calculating a numerical value for the diameter BC in irrational form or multiple terms, resulting from solving the system parameterized by `p`, `q`, `k`. This computation is difficult due to the interplay of trigonometric identities and circle theorems on the asymmetric quadrilateral.

Step 3
#Rewritten Instruction#:
Cyclic quadrilateral $A B C D$ satisfies $A B=p$, $A D=q$, $C D=\cos \angle A B C$, and $\cos \angle B A D = -k$ ($p > q > 0$, $k > 0$).

(In other words, these angles form an arithmetic sequence.\n\nSince these three angles are the angles in a triangle, then their sum is $180^{\\circ}$, and so\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\theta+(\\theta+\\delta)+(\\theta+2 \\delta) & =180^{\\circ} \\\\\n3 \\theta+3 \\delta & =180^{\\circ} \\\\\n\\theta+\\delta & =60^{\\circ}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn other words, $\\angle A B C=60^{\\circ}$.\n\n<img_3876>\n\nWe could proceed using the cosine law:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nA C^{2} & =B C^{2}+A B^{2}-2 \\cdot B C \\cdot A B \\cdot \\cos (\\angle A B C) \\\\\n(a r)^{2} & =a^{2}+\\left(a r^{2}\\right)^{2}-2 a\\left(a r^{2}\\right) \\cos \\left(60^{\\circ}\\right) \\\\\na^{2} r^{2} & =a^{2}+a^{2} r^{4}-2 a^{2} r^{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\na^{2} r^{2} & =a^{2}+a^{2} r^{4}-a^{2} r^{2} \\\\\n0 & =a^{2} r^{4}-2 a^{2} r^{2}+a^{2} \\\\\n0 & =a^{2}\\left(r^{4}-2 r^{2}+1\\right) \\\\\n0 & =a^{2}\\left(r^{2}-1\\right)^{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis tells us that $a=0$ (which is impossible) or $r^{2}=1$ (and thus $r= \\pm 1$, which is impossible).\n\nTherefore, we have reached a logical contradiction and so such a triangle cannot exist.\n\nAlternatively, we could proceed using the sine law, noting that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\angle B A C=\\theta=(\\theta+\\delta)-\\delta=60^{\\circ}-\\delta \\\\\n& \\angle A C B=\\theta+2 \\delta=(\\theta+\\delta)+\\delta=60^{\\circ}+\\delta\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBy the sine law,\n\n$$\n\\frac{B C}{\\sin (\\angle B A C)}=\\frac{A C}{\\sin (\\angle A B C)}=\\frac{A B}{\\sin (\\angle A C B)}\n$$\n\nfrom which we obtain\n\n$$\n\\frac{a}{\\sin \\left(60^{\\circ}-\\delta\\right)}=\\frac{a r}{\\sin \\left(60^{\\circ}\\right)}=\\frac{a r^{2}}{\\sin \\left(60^{\\circ}+\\delta\\right)}\n$$\n\n\n\nSince $a \\neq 0$, from the first two parts,\n\n$$\nr=\\frac{a r}{a}=\\frac{\\sin 60^{\\circ}}{\\sin \\left(60^{\\circ}-\\delta\\right)}\n$$\n\nSince $a r \\neq 0$, from the second two parts,\n\n$$\nr=\\frac{a r^{2}}{a r}=\\frac{\\sin \\left(60^{\\circ}+\\delta\\right)}{\\sin 60^{\\circ}}\n$$\n\nEquating expressions for $r$, we obtain successively\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\sin 60^{\\circ}}{\\sin \\left(60^{\\circ}-\\delta\\right)} & =\\frac{\\sin \\left(60^{\\circ}+\\delta\\right)}{\\sin 60^{\\circ}} \\\\\n\\sin ^{2} 60^{\\circ} & =\\sin \\left(60^{\\circ}-\\delta\\right) \\sin \\left(60^{\\circ}+\\delta\\right) \\\\\n\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^{2} & =\\left(\\sin 60^{\\circ} \\cos \\delta-\\cos 60^{\\circ} \\sin \\delta\\right)\\left(\\sin 60^{\\circ} \\cos \\delta+\\cos 60^{\\circ} \\sin \\delta\\right) \\\\\n\\frac{3}{4} & =\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cos \\delta-\\frac{1}{2} \\sin \\delta\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cos \\delta+\\frac{1}{2} \\sin \\delta\\right) \\\\\n\\frac{3}{4} & =\\frac{3}{4} \\cos ^{2} \\delta-\\frac{1}{4} \\sin ^{2} \\delta \\\\\n\\frac{3}{4} & =\\frac{3}{4} \\cos ^{2} \\delta+\\frac{3}{4} \\sin ^{2} \\delta-\\sin ^{2} \\delta \\\\\n\\frac{3}{4} & =\\frac{3}{4}\\left(\\cos ^{2} \\delta+\\sin ^{2} \\delta\\right)-\\sin ^{2} \\delta \\\\\n\\frac{3}{4} & =\\frac{3}{4}-\\sin ^{2} \\delta \\\\\n\\sin ^{2} \\delta & =0\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich means that $\\delta=0^{\\circ}$. (Any other angle $\\delta$ with $\\sin \\delta=0$ would not produce angles in a triangle.)\n\nTherefore, all three angles in the triangle are $60^{\\circ}$, which means that the triangle is equilateral, which it cannot be.\n\nTherefore, we have reached a logical contradiction and so such a triangle cannot exist.\n\n#']"
