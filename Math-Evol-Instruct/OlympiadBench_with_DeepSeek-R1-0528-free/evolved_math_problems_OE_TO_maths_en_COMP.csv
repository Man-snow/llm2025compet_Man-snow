- Fixed values: 20 distinct positive integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{20}$.
- Congruence condition: For each $k=1,2,\ldots,20$, $N \equiv a_k \pmod{k}$.
- Moves: Sergey queries a set $S \subseteq \{1,2,\ldots,20\}$, and receives the set $\{a_k : k \in S\}$ without indices.
- Objective: Number of moves for Sergey to guarantee determining $N$.
- Theme: Modular arithmetic reconstruction from incomplete information.

Step 2
#Plan#:
- Increase the number of fixed values from 20 to 30 to handle more variables.
- Reduce the upper bound of $N$ from 5000 to 500 to tighten the constraint and increase sensitivity to moduli.
- Add a query size restriction: Sergey can only ask for subsets of size at most 4 to limit information per move.
- Introduce non-consecutive moduli for complexity: Use $m_i = i + 4$ for $i=1$ to $30$ (i.e., moduli from 5 to 34) to avoid small moduli issues and ensure distinct residues.

3. Introduce aspect ratio constraint: require the rectangle to have aspect ratio between $1/r$ and $r$ for a given $r > 1$, adding a parameter that affects $\mu$.  
4. Ensure logical connections: Higher point density raises the threshold for isolation; no collinearity simplifies area calculations but tightens configurations; aspect ratio restricts rectangle shapes, deepening geometric dependency.

Consequently, if $k$ is odd we have $1=\\sum_{i=0}^{(k-1) / 2}\\left(t_{2 i+2}-t_{2 i}\\right)<\\lambda\\left(1+\\frac{k-1}{2}\\right)<1$; if $k$ is even, we have $1<1+t_{k}-t_{k-1}=$ $\\sum_{i=0}^{k / 2-1}\\left(t_{2 i+2}-t_{2 i}\\right)+\\left(t_{k+1}-t_{k-1}\\right)<\\lambda\\left(1+\\frac{k}{2}\\right)<1$. A contradiction in either case.\n\n\n\nProof of Lemma 2. Let $I_{0}$, respectively $I_{1}$, be the set of all indices $i$ in the range $2, \\ldots, k-1$ such that $m_{i}$ is even, respectively odd. Clearly, $I_{0}$ and $I_{1}$ form a partition of that range. Since $m_{i} \\geq 2$ if $i$ is in $I_{0}$, and $m_{i} \\geq 1$ if $i$ is in $I_{1}$ (recall that the $m_{i}$ are positive integers),\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}=\\sum_{i \\in I_{0}} m_{i}+\\sum_{i \\in I_{1}} m_{i} \\geq 2\\left|I_{0}\\right|+\\left|I_{1}\\right|=2(k-2)-\\left|I_{1}\\right|, \\quad \\text { or } \\quad\\left|I_{1}\\right| \\geq 2(k-2)-\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}\n\n$$\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\n\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{1}}{2}\\right\\rfloor+\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{i}}{2}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{k}}{2}\\right\\rfloor & \\leq m_{1}+\\left(\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} \\frac{m_{i}}{2}-\\frac{\\left|I_{1}\\right|}{2}\\right)+m_{k} \\\\\n\n& \\leq m_{1}+\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}-(k-2)+\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}\\right)+m_{k} \\\\\n\n& =\\sum_{i=1}^{k} m_{i}-k+2 .\n\n\\end{aligned}\n\n$$']"

1.  **Polynomial:** Monic, integer coefficients, fixed maximum degree `n`.
2.  **Degree Constraint:** Degree must be at most `n`.
3.  **Bound `k`:** Positive integer `k` ≤ `n`. Fixed for the problem.
4.  **Points:** Requirement for `k+1` distinct integer points `x1, ..., xk+1`.
5.  **Condition:** The sum equality `∑ᵢ=1..k P(xi) = P(xk+1)` must hold.
6.  **Quantifier:** ""For every monic polynomial..."".
7.  **Objective:** Find all positive integers `n` satisfying the condition.

**Theme:** Ensuring a specific linear dependence among polynomial evaluations exists for all polynomials of a certain type up to a given degree.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Expand the Polynomial Set:** Instead of applying the condition to every single monic polynomial, require it to hold for every possible *pair* `(P, F)` where `P` is as before (monic, deg≤`n`, int coeffs) and `F` is a new distinct monic polynomial (deg≤`m`, int coeffs) with `m` being another variable related to `n`. This adds a layer of complexity by introducing dependencies between different polynomials.
2.  **Modify the Condition:** Replace the simple sum equality with a congruence modulo an expression involving `F`. Specifically require `∑ᵢ=₁ᵏ P(x_i) ≡ P(x_{k+1}) mod F(a_j)` for each index `j` of the points `a_j`. This introduces multiple simultaneous modular constraints tied to the new polynomial `F` and the evaluation points themselves.
3.  **Constraints on Points:** Require the `k+1` distinct integers to be `s` consecutive integers, where `s` is another variable depending on `n`, `F`, or `k`. This adds a specific structural constraint (consecutiveness) linking the points and potentially the degree/polynomials.
4.  **Modify the Bound `k`:** Instead of `k` being simply ≤ `n`, define `k` as a function of properties of `F` and `n`, like `k = |F(m) - F(0)| + b` (where `b` is a constant), making its value polynomial-dependent and more complex.
5.  **Maintain Theme:** Ensure the core theme remains: finding `n` such that the (now significantly more complex) condition holds for all relevant polynomials `P` *in conjunction with* each relevant `F`, using points constrained by the properties of `F`.

**#Elements Identified#**:  
- **Variables**: \(n > 1\) (integer), \(X\) (\(n\)-element set), \(k\) (number of subsets in a subcollection), and the collection of subsets \(A_1, \dots, A_k\).  
- **Constraints**:  
  - Subsets are distinct, proper (\(A_i \neq X\)), and non-empty.  
  - ""Tight"" defined by:  
    - \(\bigcup A_i \subsetneq X\) (proper union),  
    - No element of \(X\) lies in exactly one \(A_i\).  
  - Goal: Maximize the size of a collection with **no non-empty tight subcollection** (including the whole collection).  
- **Theme**: Extremal set theory with combinatorial constraints.  

### Step 2  
**#Plan#**:  
1. **Introduce real-world constraints and dependencies**:  
   - Assign weights to elements of \(X\), summing to \(W\), and require the weightsum of a tight subcollection's union to be at most \(\lfloor W/2 \rfloor\). This adds computational complexity.  
2. **Concretize and amplify conditions**:  
   - Replace ""no non-empty subcollection"" with ""no subcollection of size \(t\)"" (where \(t \geq 2\) is a new parameter). This scales complexity and links to Ramsey theory.  
   - Enforce pairwise intersections: Require every two subsets in a ""tight"" subcollection to intersect, adding dependency analysis.  
3. **Ensure logical coherence**:  
   - Maintain all original constraints (proper subsets, distinctness) while integrating new variables (\(w_i\), \(t\), \(W\)) with unambiguous definitions.

To show that no subcollection of the $B_{k}$ is tight, consider a subcollection $\\mathcal{C}$ whose union $U$ is a proper subset of $X$, let $m$ be an element in $X \\backslash U$, and notice that $\\mathcal{C}$ is a subcollection of $\\left\\{B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{m-1}, B_{m+n-1}, \\ldots, B_{2 n-2}\\right\\}$, since the other $B$ 's are precisely those containing $m$.

Since no subcollection of $\\mathcal{B}$ is tight, $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ is not tight, and since the union of $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ does not contain $x$, some $x^{\\prime}$ in $X$ is covered by a single member of $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$. In other words, there is a single set in $\\mathcal{B}$ covering $x^{\\prime}$ but not $x$. In this case, draw an arrow from $x$ to $x^{\\prime}$.

 'Proceed again by induction on $n$ to show that the cardinality of a collection of proper non-empty subsets of $X$, no subcollection of which is tight, does not exceed $2 n-2$.\n\n\n\nConsider any collection $\\mathcal{B}$ of proper non-empty subsets of $X$ with no tight subcollection (we call such collection good). Assume that there exist $M, N \\in \\mathcal{B}$ such that $M \\cup N$ is distinct from $M, N$, and $X$. In this case, we will show how to modify $\\mathcal{B}$ so that it remains good, contains the same number of sets, but the total number of elements in the sets of $\\mathcal{B}$ increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider a maximal (relative to set-theoretic inclusion) subcollection $\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\mathcal{B}$ such that the set $C=\\bigcup_{A \\in \\mathcal{C}} A$ is distinct from $X$ and from all members of $\\mathcal{C}$. Notice here that the union of any subcollection $\\mathcal{D} \\subset \\mathcal{B}$ cannot coincide with any $K \\in \\mathcal{B} \\backslash \\mathcal{D}$, otherwise $\\{K\\} \\cup \\mathcal{D}$ would be tight. Surely, $\\mathcal{C}$ exists (since $\\{M, N\\}$ is an example of a collection satisfying the requirements on $\\mathcal{C}$, except for maximality); moreover, $C \\notin \\mathcal{B}$ by the above remark.\n\n\n\nSince $C \\neq X$, there exists an $L \\in \\mathcal{C}$ and $x \\in L$ such that $L$ is the unique set in $\\mathcal{C}$ containing $x$. Now replace in $\\mathcal{B}$ the set $L$ by $C$ in order to obtain a new collection $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ (then $\\left|\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}\\right|=|\\mathcal{B}|$ ). We claim that $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ is good.\n\n\n\nAssume, to the contrary, that $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ contained a tight subcollection $\\mathcal{T}$; clearly, $C \\in \\mathcal{T}$, otherwise $\\mathcal{B}$ is not good. If $\\mathcal{T} \\subseteq \\mathcal{C} \\cup\\{C\\}$, then $C$ is the unique set in $\\mathcal{T}$ containing $x$ which is impossible. Therefore, there exists $P \\in \\mathcal{T} \\backslash(\\mathcal{C} \\cup\\{C\\})$. By maximality of $\\mathcal{C}$, the collection $\\mathcal{C} \\cup\\{P\\}$ does not satisfy the requirements imposed on $\\mathcal{C}$; since $P \\cup C \\neq X$, this may happen only if $C \\cup P=P$, i.e., if $C \\subset P$. But then $\\mathcal{G}=(\\mathcal{T} \\backslash\\{C\\}) \\cup \\mathcal{C}$ is a tight subcollection in $\\mathcal{B}$ : all elements of $C$ are covered by $\\mathcal{G}$ at least twice (by $P$ and an element of $\\mathcal{C}$ ), and all the rest elements are covered by $\\mathcal{G}$ the same number of times as by $\\mathcal{T}$. A contradiction. Thus $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ is good.\n\n\n\nSuch modifications may be performed finitely many times, since the total number of elements of sets in $\\mathcal{B}$ increases. Thus, at some moment we arrive at a good collection $\\mathcal{B}$ for which the procedure no longer applies. This means that for every $M, N \\in \\mathcal{B}$, either $M \\cup N=X$ or one of them is contained in the other.\n\n\n\nNow let $M$ be a minimal (with respect to inclusion) set in $\\mathcal{B}$. Then each set in $\\mathcal{B}$ either contains $M$ or forms $X$ in union with $M$ (i.e., contains $X \\backslash M$ ). Now one may easily see that the two collections\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\mathcal{B}_{+}=\\{A \\backslash M: A \\in \\mathcal{B}, M \\subset A, A \\neq M\\}, \\quad \\mathcal{B}_{-}=\\{A \\cap M: A \\in \\mathcal{B}, X \\backslash M \\subset A, A \\neq X \\backslash M\\}\n\n$$\n\n\n\nare good as collections of subsets of $X \\backslash M$ and $M$, respectively; thus, by the induction hypothesis, we have $\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{+}\\right|+\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{-}\\right| \\leq 2 n-4$.\n\n\n\nFinally, each set $A \\in \\mathcal{B}$ either produces a set in one of the two new collections, or coincides with $M$ or $X \\backslash M$. Thus $|\\mathcal{B}| \\leq\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{+}\\right|+\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{-}\\right|+2 \\leq 2 n-2$, as required.'
 'We provide yet another proof of the estimate $|\\mathcal{B}| \\leq 2 n-2$. Consider any collection $\\mathcal{B}$ of proper non-empty subsets of $X$ with no tight subcollection (we call such collection good). Arguing indirectly, we assume that there exists a good collection $\\mathcal{B}$ with $|\\mathcal{B}| \\geq 2 n-1$, and choose one such for the minimal possible value of $n$. Clearly, $n>2$.\n\n\n\nFirstly, we perform a different modification of $\\mathcal{B}$. Choose any $x \\in X$, and consider the subcollection $\\mathcal{B}_{x}=\\{B: B \\in \\mathcal{B}, x \\notin B\\}$. By our assumption, $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ is not tight. As the union of sets in $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ is distinct from $X$, either this collection is empty, or there exists an element $y \\in X$ contained in a unique member $A_{x}$ of $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$. In the former case, we add the set $B_{x}=X \\backslash\\{x\\}$ to $\\mathcal{B}$, and in the latter we replace $A_{x}$ by $B_{x}$, to form a new collection $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$. (Notice that if $B_{x} \\in \\mathcal{B}$, then $B_{x} \\in \\mathcal{B}_{x}$ and $y \\in B_{x}$, so $B_{x}=A_{x}$.)\n\n\n\nWe claim that the collection $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ is also good. Indeed, if $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ has a tight subcollection $\\mathcal{T}$, then $B_{x}$ should lie in $\\mathcal{T}$. Then, as the union of the sets in $\\mathcal{T}$ is distinct from $X$, we should have $\\mathcal{T} \\subseteq \\mathcal{B}_{x} \\cup\\left\\{B_{x}\\right\\}$. But in this case an element $y$ is contained in a unique member of $\\mathcal{T}$, namely $B_{x}$, so $\\mathcal{T}$ is not tight - a contradiction.\n\n\n\nPerform this procedure for every $x \\in X$, to get a good collection $\\mathcal{B}$ containing the sets $B_{x}=X \\backslash\\{x\\}$ for all $x \\in X$. Consider now an element $x \\in X$ such that $\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{x}\\right|$ is maximal. As we have mentioned before, there exists an element $y \\in X$ belonging to a unique member (namely, $B_{x}$ ) of $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$. Thus, $\\mathcal{B}_{x} \\backslash\\left\\{B_{x}\\right\\} \\subset \\mathcal{B}_{y}$; also, $B_{y} \\in \\mathcal{B}_{y} \\backslash \\mathcal{B}_{x}$. Thus we get $\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{y}\\right| \\geq\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{x}\\right|$, which by the maximality assumption yields the equality, which in turn means that $\\mathcal{B}_{y}=\\left(\\mathcal{B}_{x} \\backslash\\left\\{B_{x}\\right\\}\\right) \\cup\\left\\{B_{y}\\right\\}$.\n\n\n\nTherefore, each set in $\\mathcal{B} \\backslash\\left\\{B_{x}, B_{y}\\right\\}$ contains either both $x$ and $y$, or none of them. Collapsing $\\{x, y\\}$ to singleton $x^{*}$, we get a new collection of $|\\mathcal{B}|-2$ subsets of $(X \\backslash\\{x, y\\}) \\cup\\left\\{x^{*}\\right\\}$ containing no tight subcollection. This contradicts minimality of $n$.']"

We will animate the points $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ linearly in a variable $t$; then $g(t)=f\\left(A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}\\right)$ will have degree at most $\\operatorname{deg} f$ (assuming it is not zero). The claim above then establishes that any root of $g$ must be a multiple root, so if we can show that there are at least $n$ roots, we will have shown $\\operatorname{deg} g \\geq 2 n$, and so $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$.\n\n\n\nGeometrically, our goal is to exhibit $2 n$ linearly moving points so that they form a regular $2 n$-gon a total of $n$ times, but not always form one.\n\n\n\nWe will do this as follows. Draw $n$ mirrors through the origin, as lines making angles of $\\frac{\\pi}{n}$ with each other. Then, any point $P$ has a total of $2 n$ reflections in the mirrors, as shown below for $n=5$. (Some of these reflections may overlap.)\n\n\n\nDraw the $n$ angle bisectors of adjacent mirrors. Observe that the reflections of $P$ form a regular $2 n$ gon if and only if $P$ lies on one of the bisectors.\n\n\n\nWe will animate $P$ on any line $\\ell$ which intersects all $n$ bisectors (but does not pass through the origin), and let $P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{2 n}$ be its reflections. Clearly, these are also all linearly animated, and because of the reasons above, they will form a regular $2 n$-gon exactly $n$ times, when $\\ell$ meets each bisector. So this establishes $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$ for the reasons described previously.\n\n\n\nNow we pass to constructing a polynomial $f$ of degree $2 n$ having the desired property. First of all, we will instead find a polynomial $g$ which has this property, but only when points with sum zero are input. This still solves the problem, because then we can choose\n\n\n\n$$\nf\\left(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}\\right)=g\\left(A_{1}-\\bar{A}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}-\\bar{A}\\right)\n$$\n\n\n\nwhere $\\bar{A}$ is the centroid of $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$. This has the upshot that we can now always assume $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$, which will simplify the ensuing discussion.\n\n\n\n<img_3624>\n\n\n\nWe will now construct a suitable $g$ as a sum of squares. This means that, if we write $g=g_{1}^{2}+g_{2}^{2}+$ $\\cdots+g_{m}^{2}$, then $g=0$ if and only if $g_{1}=\\cdots=g_{m}=0$, and that if their degrees are $d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{m}$, then $g$ has degree at most $2 \\max \\left(d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{m}\\right)$.\n\n\n\nThus, it is sufficient to exhibit several polynomials, all of degree at most $n$, such that $2 n$ points with zero sum are the vertices of a regular $2 n$-gon if and only if the polynomials are all zero at those points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we will impose the constraints that all $\\left|A_{i}\\right|^{2}=x_{i}^{2}+y_{i}^{2}$ are equal. This uses multiple degree 2 constraints.\n\n\n\nNow, we may assume that the points $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ all lie on a circle with centre 0 , and $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$. If this circle has radius 0 , then all $A_{i}$ coincide, and we may ignore this case.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, the circle has positive radius. We will use the following lemma.\n\n\n\nLemma. Suppose that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are complex numbers of the same non-zero magnitude, and suppose that $a_{1}^{k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{k}=0, k=1, \\ldots, n$. Then $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ form a regular $2 n$-gon centred at the origin. (Conversely, this is easily seen to be sufficient.)\n\n\n\nProof. Since all the hypotheses are homogenous, we may assume (mostly for convenience) that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ lie on the unit circle. By Newton's sums, the $k$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are all zero for $k$ in the range $1, \\ldots, n$.\n\n\n\nTaking conjugates yields $a_{1}^{-k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{-k}=0$, $k=1, \\ldots, n$. Thus, we can repeat the above logic to obtain that the $k$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}^{-1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}^{-1}$ are also all zero for $k=1, \\ldots, n$. However, these are simply the $(2 n-k)$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ (divided by $a_{1} \\cdots a_{2 n}$ ), so the first $2 n-1$ symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are all zero. This implies that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ form a regular $2 n$-gon centred at the origin.\n\n\n\nWe will encode all of these constraints into our polynomial. More explicitly, write $a_{r}=x_{r}+y_{r} i$; then the constraint $a_{1}^{k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{k}=0$ can be expressed as $p_{k}+q_{k} i=0$, where $p_{k}$ and $q_{k}$ are real polynomials in the coordinates. To incorporate this, simply impose the constraints $p_{k}=0$ and $q_{k}=0$; these are conditions of degree $k \\leq n$, so their squares are all of degree at most $2 n$.\n\n\n\nTo recap, taking the sum of squares of all of these constraints gives a polynomial $f$ of degree at most $2 n$ which works whenever $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$. Finally, the centroid-shifting trick gives a polynomial which works in general, as wanted.""]"

#Elements Identified#:
- **n**: a positive integer.
- **Points**: fixed, distinct on a circle; total \(2n\) points.
- **Action**: split into \(n\) pairs; each pair joined by an oriented arrow.
- **Conditions (good configuration)**:
  1. **Non-crossing**: no two arrows cross.
  2. **Forbidden convex quadrangle**: no arrows \(\overrightarrow{AB}\) and \(\overrightarrow{CD}\) such that \(A, B, C, D\) form a convex quadrangle oriented clockwise.
- **Goal**: count the number of good configurations.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. **Modify the geometric setting**: Change the circle to the vertices of a starlike convex polygon. This increases complexity by introducing variable angular separations and irregularities in point placement, which complicates non-crossing checks and convexity assessments.
2. **Add an orientation constraint for arrows**: Require that all arrows must point in a clockwise orientation around the polygon. This adds a global directional constraint that interacts with convex quadrangles and adjacent point positions.
3. **Introduce a non-nesting condition**: Forbid nested arrows (i.e., no arrow \(\overrightarrow{AB}\) and \(\overrightarrow{CD}\) where \(C\) and \(D\) lie entirely between \(A\) and \(B\) on the shorter arc between them). This adds local geometric constraints and intertwines with the non-crossing condition.
4. **Ensure logical coherence**: The changes should maintain core concepts while adding complexity.

Let $\\ell$, respectively $r$, be the left, respectively right, cell of $D$ and notice that the cell below $\\ell$, respectively $r$, is the right, respectively left, cell of a domino $D_{1}$, respectively $D_{2}$, in the arrangement.\n\n\n\nIf $\\ell$ is covered by a domino $D_{\\ell}$ in the arrangement, since $D$ is bad and no two dominoes in the arrangement form a square, it follows that $D_{\\ell}$ is vertical. If $r$ were also covered by a domino $D_{r}$ in the arrangement, then $D_{r}$ would also be vertical, and would therefore form a square with $D_{\\ell}-$ a contradiction. Hence $r$ is not covered, and there is room for $D_{\\ell}$ to be placed so as to cover $D$, to obtain a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes. The case where $r$ is covered is dealt with similarly.\n\n\n\nFinally, if neither cell of $D$ is covered, addition of an extra domino to cover $D$ and, if necessary, removal of the domino above $D$ to avoid formation of a square, yields a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has at least as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes. (Figure 5 illustrates the two cases.)'
 ""We present an alternative proof of the bound.\n\n\n\nLabel the rows upwards $0,1, \\ldots, m-1$, and the columns from the left to the right by $0,1, \\ldots, 2 n-1$; label each cell by the pair of its column's and row's numbers, so that $(1,0)$ is the second left cell in the bottom row. Colour the cells chess-like so that $(0,0)$ is white. For $0 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, we say that the $i$ th white diagonal is the set of cells of the form $(2 i+k, k)$, where $k$ ranges over all appropriate indices. Similarly, the ith black diagonal is the set of cells of the form $(2 i+1-k, k)$. (Notice that the white cells in the upper-left corner and the black cells in the upper-right corner are not covered by these diagonals.)\n\n\n\nClaim. Assume that $K$ lowest cells of some white diagonal are all covered by dominoes. Then all these $K$ dominoes face right or up from the diagonal. (In other words, the black cell of any such\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndomino is to the right or to the top of its white cell.) Similarly, if $K$ lowest cells of some black diagonal are covered by dominoes, then all these dominoes face left or up from the diagonal.\n\n\n\nProof. By symmetry, it suffices to prove the first statement. Assume that $K$ lowest cells of the $i$ th white diagonal is completely covered. We prove by induction on $k<K$ that the required claim holds for the domino covering $(2 i+k, k)$. The base case $k=0$ holds due to the problem condition. To establish the step, one observes that if $(2 i+k, k)$ is covered by a domino facing up of right, while $(2 i+k+1, k+1)$ is covered by a domino facing down or left, then these two dominoes form a square.\n\n\n\nWe turn to the solution. We will prove that there are at least $d=\\lfloor m / 2\\rfloor$ empty white cells. Since each domino covers exactly one white cell, the required bound follows.\n\n\n\nIf each of the first $d$ white diagonals contains an empty cell, the result is clear. Otherwise, let $i<d$ be the least index of a completely covered white diagonal. We say that the dominoes covering our diagonal are distinguished. After removing the distinguished dominoes, the board splits into two parts; the left part $L$ contains $i$ empty white cells on the previous diagonals. So, it suffices to prove that the right part $R$ contains at least $d-i$ empty white cells.\n\n\n\nLet $j$ be the number of distinguished dominoes facing up. Then at least $j-i$ of these dominoes cover some cells of (distinct) black diagonals (the relation $m \\leq n$ is used). Each such domino faces down from the corresponding black diagonal - so, by the Claim, each such black diagonal contains an empty cell in $R$. Thus, $R$ contains at least $j-i$ empty black cells.\n\n\n\nNow, let $w$ be the number of white cells in $R$. Then the number of black cells in $R$ is $w-d+j$, and at least $i-j$ of those are empty. Thus, the number of dominoes in $R$ is at most $(w-d+j)-(j-i)=w-(d-i)$, so $R$ contains at least $d-i$ empty white cells, as we wanted to show.""]"

*   **Solution Path:** Requires applying the undefined condition from part (a) to find restrictions on \(b, c, d\), then computing the product.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Explicit Constraint:** Replace the implicit reference ""the condition in part (a)"" with a specific, moderately complex condition. Define that the sequence *after translation* (\(a_n - a_{n-1}\) for \(n \geq 1\)) forms an arithmetic progression. However, explicitly require the cubic relation to hold for *all* integers \(n\).
2.  **Parameter Constraint:** Introduce a divisibility/multiplicity constraint on the linear coefficient \(c\). Specify that \(c\) must be divisible by a specific prime number (e.g., 5) and require finding possible values modulo that prime.
3.  **Result Complexity:** Instead of directly computing \(a_{2015} \cdot a_{2016}\) after finding parameters, require determining the *possible values* of the product *based* on the allowed combinations of \(b, c, d\) under the new constraints, implying solving a system first.
4.  **Scale Down:** Replace large indices 2015, 2016 with smaller, consecutive indices like \(a_2 \cdot a_3\) to reduce unnecessary large calculations without losing mathematical essence or the concept of consecutive terms.
5.  **Ensure Coherence:** All additions are interdependent. The sequence definition and domain are fixed. The explicit translation condition constrains all parameters. The prime constraint on \(c\) adds a layer of modular arithmetic. Solving for possible products based on parameter constraints derived from both explicit conditions requires deeper logical inference.

We will show that $p=0$ or $q=0$. Consider the line $y=(q-p) x+p$ passing through $(0, p)$ and $(1, q)$; the latter are two points the line under consideration and the cubic $y^{2}=x^{3}+b x^{2}+c x+d$ share.

Then there is a small triangle in each pair. Without loss of generality, assume that triangles $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ and $D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}$ are small.

This contradicts the Lemma, applied for triangle $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ inside $L K B$.\n\nCase 2. Ray $C_{1} D_{1}$ does not intersect $A B$. Then choose a ""sufficiently far"" point $K$ on ray $B A$ such that $\\left[K A_{1} C_{1}\\right]>\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]$, and that ray $K C_{1}$ intersects line $B C$ at some point $L$ (see Figure 5). Since ray $C_{1} D_{1}$ does not intersect line $A B$, the points $A$ and $D_{1}$ are on different sides of $K L$; then $A$ and $D$ are also on different sides, and $C$ is on the same side as $A$ and $B$.

So $2\\left(7^{a}+3^{b}\\right) \\mid 7^{k}-3^{n}$ and $7^{k}-3^{n} \\mid k^{4}+n^{2}=2\\left(8 a^{4}+2 b^{2}\\right)$, hence\n$$\n7^{a}+3^{b} \\leq 8 a^{4}+2 b^{2}\n$$\nWe prove by induction that $8 a^{4}<7^{a}$ for $a \\geq 4,2 b^{2}<3^{b}$ for $b \\geq 1$ and $2 b^{2}+9 \\leq 3^{b}$ for $b \\geq 3$. In the initial cases $a=4, b=1, b=2$ and $b=3$ we have $8 \\cdot 4^{4}=2048<7^{4}=2401,2<3$, $2 \\cdot 2^{2}=8<3^{2}=9$ and $2 \\cdot 3^{2}+9=3^{3}=27$, respectively.\n\nIf $8 a^{4}<7^{a}(a \\geq 4)$ and $2 b^{2}+9 \\leq 3^{b}(b \\geq 3)$, then\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n8(a+1)^{4} & =8 a^{4}\\left(\\frac{a+1}{a}\\right)^{4}<7^{a}\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^{4}=7^{a} \\frac{625}{256}<7^{a+1} \\quad \\text { and } \\\\\n2(b+1)^{2}+9 & <\\left(2 b^{2}+9\\right)\\left(\\frac{b+1}{b}\\right)^{2} \\leq 3^{b}\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{2}=3^{b} \\frac{16}{9}<3^{b+1},\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nas desired.\n\nFor $a \\geq 4$ we obtain $7^{a}+3^{b}>8 a^{4}+2 b^{2}$ and inequality (1) cannot hold. Hence $a \\leq 3$, and three cases are possible.\n\nCase 1: $a=1$. Then $k=2$ and $8+2 b^{2} \\geq 7+3^{b}$, thus $2 b^{2}+1 \\geq 3^{b}$. This is possible only if $b \\leq 2$. If $b=1$ then $n=2$ and $\\frac{k^{4}+n^{2}}{7^{k}-3^{n}}=\\frac{2^{4}+2^{2}}{7^{2}-3^{2}}=\\frac{1}{2}$, which is not an integer. If $b=2$ then $n=4$ and $\\frac{k^{4}+n^{2}}{7^{k}-3^{n}}=\\frac{2^{4}+4^{2}}{7^{2}-3^{4}}=-1$, so $(k, n)=(2,4)$ is a solution.\n\nCase 2: $a=2$. Then $k=4$ and $k^{4}+n^{2}=256+4 b^{2} \\geq\\left|7^{4}-3^{n}\\right|=\\left|49-3^{b}\\right| \\cdot\\left(49+3^{b}\\right)$. The smallest value of the first factor is 22 , attained at $b=3$, so $128+2 b^{2} \\geq 11\\left(49+3^{b}\\right)$, which is impossible since $3^{b}>2 b^{2}$.\n\nCase 3: $a=3$. Then $k=6$ and $k^{4}+n^{2}=1296+4 b^{2} \\geq\\left|7^{6}-3^{n}\\right|=\\left|343-3^{b}\\right| \\cdot\\left(343+3^{b}\\right)$. Analogously, $\\left|343-3^{b}\\right| \\geq 100$ and we have $324+b^{2} \\geq 25\\left(343+3^{b}\\right)$, which is impossible again.\n\nWe find that there exists a unique solution $(k, n)=(2,4)$.']"
