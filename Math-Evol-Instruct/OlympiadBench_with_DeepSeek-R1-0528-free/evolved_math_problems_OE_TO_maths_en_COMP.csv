- Fixed values: 20 distinct positive integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{20}$.
- Congruence condition: For each $k=1,2,\ldots,20$, $N \equiv a_k \pmod{k}$.
- Moves: Sergey queries a set $S \subseteq \{1,2,\ldots,20\}$, and receives the set $\{a_k : k \in S\}$ without indices.
- Objective: Number of moves for Sergey to guarantee determining $N$.
- Theme: Modular arithmetic reconstruction from incomplete information.

Step 2
#Plan#:
- Increase the number of fixed values from 20 to 30 to handle more variables.
- Reduce the upper bound of $N$ from 5000 to 500 to tighten the constraint and increase sensitivity to moduli.
- Add a query size restriction: Sergey can only ask for subsets of size at most 4 to limit information per move.
- Introduce non-consecutive moduli for complexity: Use $m_i = i + 4$ for $i=1$ to $30$ (i.e., moduli from 5 to 34) to avoid small moduli issues and ensure distinct residues.

3. Introduce aspect ratio constraint: require the rectangle to have aspect ratio between $1/r$ and $r$ for a given $r > 1$, adding a parameter that affects $\mu$.  
4. Ensure logical connections: Higher point density raises the threshold for isolation; no collinearity simplifies area calculations but tightens configurations; aspect ratio restricts rectangle shapes, deepening geometric dependency.

Consequently, if $k$ is odd we have $1=\\sum_{i=0}^{(k-1) / 2}\\left(t_{2 i+2}-t_{2 i}\\right)<\\lambda\\left(1+\\frac{k-1}{2}\\right)<1$; if $k$ is even, we have $1<1+t_{k}-t_{k-1}=$ $\\sum_{i=0}^{k / 2-1}\\left(t_{2 i+2}-t_{2 i}\\right)+\\left(t_{k+1}-t_{k-1}\\right)<\\lambda\\left(1+\\frac{k}{2}\\right)<1$. A contradiction in either case.\n\n\n\nProof of Lemma 2. Let $I_{0}$, respectively $I_{1}$, be the set of all indices $i$ in the range $2, \\ldots, k-1$ such that $m_{i}$ is even, respectively odd. Clearly, $I_{0}$ and $I_{1}$ form a partition of that range. Since $m_{i} \\geq 2$ if $i$ is in $I_{0}$, and $m_{i} \\geq 1$ if $i$ is in $I_{1}$ (recall that the $m_{i}$ are positive integers),\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}=\\sum_{i \\in I_{0}} m_{i}+\\sum_{i \\in I_{1}} m_{i} \\geq 2\\left|I_{0}\\right|+\\left|I_{1}\\right|=2(k-2)-\\left|I_{1}\\right|, \\quad \\text { or } \\quad\\left|I_{1}\\right| \\geq 2(k-2)-\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}\n\n$$\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\n\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{1}}{2}\\right\\rfloor+\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{i}}{2}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{m_{k}}{2}\\right\\rfloor & \\leq m_{1}+\\left(\\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} \\frac{m_{i}}{2}-\\frac{\\left|I_{1}\\right|}{2}\\right)+m_{k} \\\\\n\n& \\leq m_{1}+\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}-(k-2)+\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=2}^{k-1} m_{i}\\right)+m_{k} \\\\\n\n& =\\sum_{i=1}^{k} m_{i}-k+2 .\n\n\\end{aligned}\n\n$$']"

1.  **Polynomial:** Monic, integer coefficients, fixed maximum degree `n`.
2.  **Degree Constraint:** Degree must be at most `n`.
3.  **Bound `k`:** Positive integer `k` ≤ `n`. Fixed for the problem.
4.  **Points:** Requirement for `k+1` distinct integer points `x1, ..., xk+1`.
5.  **Condition:** The sum equality `∑ᵢ=1..k P(xi) = P(xk+1)` must hold.
6.  **Quantifier:** ""For every monic polynomial..."".
7.  **Objective:** Find all positive integers `n` satisfying the condition.

**Theme:** Ensuring a specific linear dependence among polynomial evaluations exists for all polynomials of a certain type up to a given degree.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Expand the Polynomial Set:** Instead of applying the condition to every single monic polynomial, require it to hold for every possible *pair* `(P, F)` where `P` is as before (monic, deg≤`n`, int coeffs) and `F` is a new distinct monic polynomial (deg≤`m`, int coeffs) with `m` being another variable related to `n`. This adds a layer of complexity by introducing dependencies between different polynomials.
2.  **Modify the Condition:** Replace the simple sum equality with a congruence modulo an expression involving `F`. Specifically require `∑ᵢ=₁ᵏ P(x_i) ≡ P(x_{k+1}) mod F(a_j)` for each index `j` of the points `a_j`. This introduces multiple simultaneous modular constraints tied to the new polynomial `F` and the evaluation points themselves.
3.  **Constraints on Points:** Require the `k+1` distinct integers to be `s` consecutive integers, where `s` is another variable depending on `n`, `F`, or `k`. This adds a specific structural constraint (consecutiveness) linking the points and potentially the degree/polynomials.
4.  **Modify the Bound `k`:** Instead of `k` being simply ≤ `n`, define `k` as a function of properties of `F` and `n`, like `k = |F(m) - F(0)| + b` (where `b` is a constant), making its value polynomial-dependent and more complex.
5.  **Maintain Theme:** Ensure the core theme remains: finding `n` such that the (now significantly more complex) condition holds for all relevant polynomials `P` *in conjunction with* each relevant `F`, using points constrained by the properties of `F`.

**#Elements Identified#**:  
- **Variables**: \(n > 1\) (integer), \(X\) (\(n\)-element set), \(k\) (number of subsets in a subcollection), and the collection of subsets \(A_1, \dots, A_k\).  
- **Constraints**:  
  - Subsets are distinct, proper (\(A_i \neq X\)), and non-empty.  
  - ""Tight"" defined by:  
    - \(\bigcup A_i \subsetneq X\) (proper union),  
    - No element of \(X\) lies in exactly one \(A_i\).  
  - Goal: Maximize the size of a collection with **no non-empty tight subcollection** (including the whole collection).  
- **Theme**: Extremal set theory with combinatorial constraints.  

### Step 2  
**#Plan#**:  
1. **Introduce real-world constraints and dependencies**:  
   - Assign weights to elements of \(X\), summing to \(W\), and require the weightsum of a tight subcollection's union to be at most \(\lfloor W/2 \rfloor\). This adds computational complexity.  
2. **Concretize and amplify conditions**:  
   - Replace ""no non-empty subcollection"" with ""no subcollection of size \(t\)"" (where \(t \geq 2\) is a new parameter). This scales complexity and links to Ramsey theory.  
   - Enforce pairwise intersections: Require every two subsets in a ""tight"" subcollection to intersect, adding dependency analysis.  
3. **Ensure logical coherence**:  
   - Maintain all original constraints (proper subsets, distinctness) while integrating new variables (\(w_i\), \(t\), \(W\)) with unambiguous definitions.

To show that no subcollection of the $B_{k}$ is tight, consider a subcollection $\\mathcal{C}$ whose union $U$ is a proper subset of $X$, let $m$ be an element in $X \\backslash U$, and notice that $\\mathcal{C}$ is a subcollection of $\\left\\{B_{1}, \\ldots, B_{m-1}, B_{m+n-1}, \\ldots, B_{2 n-2}\\right\\}$, since the other $B$ 's are precisely those containing $m$.

Since no subcollection of $\\mathcal{B}$ is tight, $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ is not tight, and since the union of $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ does not contain $x$, some $x^{\\prime}$ in $X$ is covered by a single member of $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$. In other words, there is a single set in $\\mathcal{B}$ covering $x^{\\prime}$ but not $x$. In this case, draw an arrow from $x$ to $x^{\\prime}$.

 'Proceed again by induction on $n$ to show that the cardinality of a collection of proper non-empty subsets of $X$, no subcollection of which is tight, does not exceed $2 n-2$.\n\n\n\nConsider any collection $\\mathcal{B}$ of proper non-empty subsets of $X$ with no tight subcollection (we call such collection good). Assume that there exist $M, N \\in \\mathcal{B}$ such that $M \\cup N$ is distinct from $M, N$, and $X$. In this case, we will show how to modify $\\mathcal{B}$ so that it remains good, contains the same number of sets, but the total number of elements in the sets of $\\mathcal{B}$ increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider a maximal (relative to set-theoretic inclusion) subcollection $\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\mathcal{B}$ such that the set $C=\\bigcup_{A \\in \\mathcal{C}} A$ is distinct from $X$ and from all members of $\\mathcal{C}$. Notice here that the union of any subcollection $\\mathcal{D} \\subset \\mathcal{B}$ cannot coincide with any $K \\in \\mathcal{B} \\backslash \\mathcal{D}$, otherwise $\\{K\\} \\cup \\mathcal{D}$ would be tight. Surely, $\\mathcal{C}$ exists (since $\\{M, N\\}$ is an example of a collection satisfying the requirements on $\\mathcal{C}$, except for maximality); moreover, $C \\notin \\mathcal{B}$ by the above remark.\n\n\n\nSince $C \\neq X$, there exists an $L \\in \\mathcal{C}$ and $x \\in L$ such that $L$ is the unique set in $\\mathcal{C}$ containing $x$. Now replace in $\\mathcal{B}$ the set $L$ by $C$ in order to obtain a new collection $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ (then $\\left|\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}\\right|=|\\mathcal{B}|$ ). We claim that $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ is good.\n\n\n\nAssume, to the contrary, that $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ contained a tight subcollection $\\mathcal{T}$; clearly, $C \\in \\mathcal{T}$, otherwise $\\mathcal{B}$ is not good. If $\\mathcal{T} \\subseteq \\mathcal{C} \\cup\\{C\\}$, then $C$ is the unique set in $\\mathcal{T}$ containing $x$ which is impossible. Therefore, there exists $P \\in \\mathcal{T} \\backslash(\\mathcal{C} \\cup\\{C\\})$. By maximality of $\\mathcal{C}$, the collection $\\mathcal{C} \\cup\\{P\\}$ does not satisfy the requirements imposed on $\\mathcal{C}$; since $P \\cup C \\neq X$, this may happen only if $C \\cup P=P$, i.e., if $C \\subset P$. But then $\\mathcal{G}=(\\mathcal{T} \\backslash\\{C\\}) \\cup \\mathcal{C}$ is a tight subcollection in $\\mathcal{B}$ : all elements of $C$ are covered by $\\mathcal{G}$ at least twice (by $P$ and an element of $\\mathcal{C}$ ), and all the rest elements are covered by $\\mathcal{G}$ the same number of times as by $\\mathcal{T}$. A contradiction. Thus $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ is good.\n\n\n\nSuch modifications may be performed finitely many times, since the total number of elements of sets in $\\mathcal{B}$ increases. Thus, at some moment we arrive at a good collection $\\mathcal{B}$ for which the procedure no longer applies. This means that for every $M, N \\in \\mathcal{B}$, either $M \\cup N=X$ or one of them is contained in the other.\n\n\n\nNow let $M$ be a minimal (with respect to inclusion) set in $\\mathcal{B}$. Then each set in $\\mathcal{B}$ either contains $M$ or forms $X$ in union with $M$ (i.e., contains $X \\backslash M$ ). Now one may easily see that the two collections\n\n\n\n$$\n\n\\mathcal{B}_{+}=\\{A \\backslash M: A \\in \\mathcal{B}, M \\subset A, A \\neq M\\}, \\quad \\mathcal{B}_{-}=\\{A \\cap M: A \\in \\mathcal{B}, X \\backslash M \\subset A, A \\neq X \\backslash M\\}\n\n$$\n\n\n\nare good as collections of subsets of $X \\backslash M$ and $M$, respectively; thus, by the induction hypothesis, we have $\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{+}\\right|+\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{-}\\right| \\leq 2 n-4$.\n\n\n\nFinally, each set $A \\in \\mathcal{B}$ either produces a set in one of the two new collections, or coincides with $M$ or $X \\backslash M$. Thus $|\\mathcal{B}| \\leq\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{+}\\right|+\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{-}\\right|+2 \\leq 2 n-2$, as required.'
 'We provide yet another proof of the estimate $|\\mathcal{B}| \\leq 2 n-2$. Consider any collection $\\mathcal{B}$ of proper non-empty subsets of $X$ with no tight subcollection (we call such collection good). Arguing indirectly, we assume that there exists a good collection $\\mathcal{B}$ with $|\\mathcal{B}| \\geq 2 n-1$, and choose one such for the minimal possible value of $n$. Clearly, $n>2$.\n\n\n\nFirstly, we perform a different modification of $\\mathcal{B}$. Choose any $x \\in X$, and consider the subcollection $\\mathcal{B}_{x}=\\{B: B \\in \\mathcal{B}, x \\notin B\\}$. By our assumption, $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ is not tight. As the union of sets in $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$ is distinct from $X$, either this collection is empty, or there exists an element $y \\in X$ contained in a unique member $A_{x}$ of $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$. In the former case, we add the set $B_{x}=X \\backslash\\{x\\}$ to $\\mathcal{B}$, and in the latter we replace $A_{x}$ by $B_{x}$, to form a new collection $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$. (Notice that if $B_{x} \\in \\mathcal{B}$, then $B_{x} \\in \\mathcal{B}_{x}$ and $y \\in B_{x}$, so $B_{x}=A_{x}$.)\n\n\n\nWe claim that the collection $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ is also good. Indeed, if $\\mathcal{B}^{\\prime}$ has a tight subcollection $\\mathcal{T}$, then $B_{x}$ should lie in $\\mathcal{T}$. Then, as the union of the sets in $\\mathcal{T}$ is distinct from $X$, we should have $\\mathcal{T} \\subseteq \\mathcal{B}_{x} \\cup\\left\\{B_{x}\\right\\}$. But in this case an element $y$ is contained in a unique member of $\\mathcal{T}$, namely $B_{x}$, so $\\mathcal{T}$ is not tight - a contradiction.\n\n\n\nPerform this procedure for every $x \\in X$, to get a good collection $\\mathcal{B}$ containing the sets $B_{x}=X \\backslash\\{x\\}$ for all $x \\in X$. Consider now an element $x \\in X$ such that $\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{x}\\right|$ is maximal. As we have mentioned before, there exists an element $y \\in X$ belonging to a unique member (namely, $B_{x}$ ) of $\\mathcal{B}_{x}$. Thus, $\\mathcal{B}_{x} \\backslash\\left\\{B_{x}\\right\\} \\subset \\mathcal{B}_{y}$; also, $B_{y} \\in \\mathcal{B}_{y} \\backslash \\mathcal{B}_{x}$. Thus we get $\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{y}\\right| \\geq\\left|\\mathcal{B}_{x}\\right|$, which by the maximality assumption yields the equality, which in turn means that $\\mathcal{B}_{y}=\\left(\\mathcal{B}_{x} \\backslash\\left\\{B_{x}\\right\\}\\right) \\cup\\left\\{B_{y}\\right\\}$.\n\n\n\nTherefore, each set in $\\mathcal{B} \\backslash\\left\\{B_{x}, B_{y}\\right\\}$ contains either both $x$ and $y$, or none of them. Collapsing $\\{x, y\\}$ to singleton $x^{*}$, we get a new collection of $|\\mathcal{B}|-2$ subsets of $(X \\backslash\\{x, y\\}) \\cup\\left\\{x^{*}\\right\\}$ containing no tight subcollection. This contradicts minimality of $n$.']"

We will animate the points $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ linearly in a variable $t$; then $g(t)=f\\left(A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}\\right)$ will have degree at most $\\operatorname{deg} f$ (assuming it is not zero). The claim above then establishes that any root of $g$ must be a multiple root, so if we can show that there are at least $n$ roots, we will have shown $\\operatorname{deg} g \\geq 2 n$, and so $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$.\n\n\n\nGeometrically, our goal is to exhibit $2 n$ linearly moving points so that they form a regular $2 n$-gon a total of $n$ times, but not always form one.\n\n\n\nWe will do this as follows. Draw $n$ mirrors through the origin, as lines making angles of $\\frac{\\pi}{n}$ with each other. Then, any point $P$ has a total of $2 n$ reflections in the mirrors, as shown below for $n=5$. (Some of these reflections may overlap.)\n\n\n\nDraw the $n$ angle bisectors of adjacent mirrors. Observe that the reflections of $P$ form a regular $2 n$ gon if and only if $P$ lies on one of the bisectors.\n\n\n\nWe will animate $P$ on any line $\\ell$ which intersects all $n$ bisectors (but does not pass through the origin), and let $P_{1}, \\ldots, P_{2 n}$ be its reflections. Clearly, these are also all linearly animated, and because of the reasons above, they will form a regular $2 n$-gon exactly $n$ times, when $\\ell$ meets each bisector. So this establishes $\\operatorname{deg} f \\geq 2 n$ for the reasons described previously.\n\n\n\nNow we pass to constructing a polynomial $f$ of degree $2 n$ having the desired property. First of all, we will instead find a polynomial $g$ which has this property, but only when points with sum zero are input. This still solves the problem, because then we can choose\n\n\n\n$$\nf\\left(A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}\\right)=g\\left(A_{1}-\\bar{A}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}-\\bar{A}\\right)\n$$\n\n\n\nwhere $\\bar{A}$ is the centroid of $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$. This has the upshot that we can now always assume $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$, which will simplify the ensuing discussion.\n\n\n\n<img_3624>\n\n\n\nWe will now construct a suitable $g$ as a sum of squares. This means that, if we write $g=g_{1}^{2}+g_{2}^{2}+$ $\\cdots+g_{m}^{2}$, then $g=0$ if and only if $g_{1}=\\cdots=g_{m}=0$, and that if their degrees are $d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{m}$, then $g$ has degree at most $2 \\max \\left(d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{m}\\right)$.\n\n\n\nThus, it is sufficient to exhibit several polynomials, all of degree at most $n$, such that $2 n$ points with zero sum are the vertices of a regular $2 n$-gon if and only if the polynomials are all zero at those points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we will impose the constraints that all $\\left|A_{i}\\right|^{2}=x_{i}^{2}+y_{i}^{2}$ are equal. This uses multiple degree 2 constraints.\n\n\n\nNow, we may assume that the points $A_{1}, \\ldots, A_{2 n}$ all lie on a circle with centre 0 , and $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$. If this circle has radius 0 , then all $A_{i}$ coincide, and we may ignore this case.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, the circle has positive radius. We will use the following lemma.\n\n\n\nLemma. Suppose that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are complex numbers of the same non-zero magnitude, and suppose that $a_{1}^{k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{k}=0, k=1, \\ldots, n$. Then $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ form a regular $2 n$-gon centred at the origin. (Conversely, this is easily seen to be sufficient.)\n\n\n\nProof. Since all the hypotheses are homogenous, we may assume (mostly for convenience) that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ lie on the unit circle. By Newton's sums, the $k$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are all zero for $k$ in the range $1, \\ldots, n$.\n\n\n\nTaking conjugates yields $a_{1}^{-k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{-k}=0$, $k=1, \\ldots, n$. Thus, we can repeat the above logic to obtain that the $k$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}^{-1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}^{-1}$ are also all zero for $k=1, \\ldots, n$. However, these are simply the $(2 n-k)$-th symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ (divided by $a_{1} \\cdots a_{2 n}$ ), so the first $2 n-1$ symmetric sums of $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ are all zero. This implies that $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{2 n}$ form a regular $2 n$-gon centred at the origin.\n\n\n\nWe will encode all of these constraints into our polynomial. More explicitly, write $a_{r}=x_{r}+y_{r} i$; then the constraint $a_{1}^{k}+\\cdots+a_{2 n}^{k}=0$ can be expressed as $p_{k}+q_{k} i=0$, where $p_{k}$ and $q_{k}$ are real polynomials in the coordinates. To incorporate this, simply impose the constraints $p_{k}=0$ and $q_{k}=0$; these are conditions of degree $k \\leq n$, so their squares are all of degree at most $2 n$.\n\n\n\nTo recap, taking the sum of squares of all of these constraints gives a polynomial $f$ of degree at most $2 n$ which works whenever $A_{1}+\\cdots+A_{2 n}=0$. Finally, the centroid-shifting trick gives a polynomial which works in general, as wanted.""]"

#Elements Identified#:
- **n**: a positive integer.
- **Points**: fixed, distinct on a circle; total \(2n\) points.
- **Action**: split into \(n\) pairs; each pair joined by an oriented arrow.
- **Conditions (good configuration)**:
  1. **Non-crossing**: no two arrows cross.
  2. **Forbidden convex quadrangle**: no arrows \(\overrightarrow{AB}\) and \(\overrightarrow{CD}\) such that \(A, B, C, D\) form a convex quadrangle oriented clockwise.
- **Goal**: count the number of good configurations.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. **Modify the geometric setting**: Change the circle to the vertices of a starlike convex polygon. This increases complexity by introducing variable angular separations and irregularities in point placement, which complicates non-crossing checks and convexity assessments.
2. **Add an orientation constraint for arrows**: Require that all arrows must point in a clockwise orientation around the polygon. This adds a global directional constraint that interacts with convex quadrangles and adjacent point positions.
3. **Introduce a non-nesting condition**: Forbid nested arrows (i.e., no arrow \(\overrightarrow{AB}\) and \(\overrightarrow{CD}\) where \(C\) and \(D\) lie entirely between \(A\) and \(B\) on the shorter arc between them). This adds local geometric constraints and intertwines with the non-crossing condition.
4. **Ensure logical coherence**: The changes should maintain core concepts while adding complexity.

Let $\\ell$, respectively $r$, be the left, respectively right, cell of $D$ and notice that the cell below $\\ell$, respectively $r$, is the right, respectively left, cell of a domino $D_{1}$, respectively $D_{2}$, in the arrangement.\n\n\n\nIf $\\ell$ is covered by a domino $D_{\\ell}$ in the arrangement, since $D$ is bad and no two dominoes in the arrangement form a square, it follows that $D_{\\ell}$ is vertical. If $r$ were also covered by a domino $D_{r}$ in the arrangement, then $D_{r}$ would also be vertical, and would therefore form a square with $D_{\\ell}-$ a contradiction. Hence $r$ is not covered, and there is room for $D_{\\ell}$ to be placed so as to cover $D$, to obtain a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes. The case where $r$ is covered is dealt with similarly.\n\n\n\nFinally, if neither cell of $D$ is covered, addition of an extra domino to cover $D$ and, if necessary, removal of the domino above $D$ to avoid formation of a square, yields a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has at least as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes. (Figure 5 illustrates the two cases.)'
 ""We present an alternative proof of the bound.\n\n\n\nLabel the rows upwards $0,1, \\ldots, m-1$, and the columns from the left to the right by $0,1, \\ldots, 2 n-1$; label each cell by the pair of its column's and row's numbers, so that $(1,0)$ is the second left cell in the bottom row. Colour the cells chess-like so that $(0,0)$ is white. For $0 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, we say that the $i$ th white diagonal is the set of cells of the form $(2 i+k, k)$, where $k$ ranges over all appropriate indices. Similarly, the ith black diagonal is the set of cells of the form $(2 i+1-k, k)$. (Notice that the white cells in the upper-left corner and the black cells in the upper-right corner are not covered by these diagonals.)\n\n\n\nClaim. Assume that $K$ lowest cells of some white diagonal are all covered by dominoes. Then all these $K$ dominoes face right or up from the diagonal. (In other words, the black cell of any such\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndomino is to the right or to the top of its white cell.) Similarly, if $K$ lowest cells of some black diagonal are covered by dominoes, then all these dominoes face left or up from the diagonal.\n\n\n\nProof. By symmetry, it suffices to prove the first statement. Assume that $K$ lowest cells of the $i$ th white diagonal is completely covered. We prove by induction on $k<K$ that the required claim holds for the domino covering $(2 i+k, k)$. The base case $k=0$ holds due to the problem condition. To establish the step, one observes that if $(2 i+k, k)$ is covered by a domino facing up of right, while $(2 i+k+1, k+1)$ is covered by a domino facing down or left, then these two dominoes form a square.\n\n\n\nWe turn to the solution. We will prove that there are at least $d=\\lfloor m / 2\\rfloor$ empty white cells. Since each domino covers exactly one white cell, the required bound follows.\n\n\n\nIf each of the first $d$ white diagonals contains an empty cell, the result is clear. Otherwise, let $i<d$ be the least index of a completely covered white diagonal. We say that the dominoes covering our diagonal are distinguished. After removing the distinguished dominoes, the board splits into two parts; the left part $L$ contains $i$ empty white cells on the previous diagonals. So, it suffices to prove that the right part $R$ contains at least $d-i$ empty white cells.\n\n\n\nLet $j$ be the number of distinguished dominoes facing up. Then at least $j-i$ of these dominoes cover some cells of (distinct) black diagonals (the relation $m \\leq n$ is used). Each such domino faces down from the corresponding black diagonal - so, by the Claim, each such black diagonal contains an empty cell in $R$. Thus, $R$ contains at least $j-i$ empty black cells.\n\n\n\nNow, let $w$ be the number of white cells in $R$. Then the number of black cells in $R$ is $w-d+j$, and at least $i-j$ of those are empty. Thus, the number of dominoes in $R$ is at most $(w-d+j)-(j-i)=w-(d-i)$, so $R$ contains at least $d-i$ empty white cells, as we wanted to show.""]"

*   **Solution Path:** Requires applying the undefined condition from part (a) to find restrictions on \(b, c, d\), then computing the product.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Explicit Constraint:** Replace the implicit reference ""the condition in part (a)"" with a specific, moderately complex condition. Define that the sequence *after translation* (\(a_n - a_{n-1}\) for \(n \geq 1\)) forms an arithmetic progression. However, explicitly require the cubic relation to hold for *all* integers \(n\).
2.  **Parameter Constraint:** Introduce a divisibility/multiplicity constraint on the linear coefficient \(c\). Specify that \(c\) must be divisible by a specific prime number (e.g., 5) and require finding possible values modulo that prime.
3.  **Result Complexity:** Instead of directly computing \(a_{2015} \cdot a_{2016}\) after finding parameters, require determining the *possible values* of the product *based* on the allowed combinations of \(b, c, d\) under the new constraints, implying solving a system first.
4.  **Scale Down:** Replace large indices 2015, 2016 with smaller, consecutive indices like \(a_2 \cdot a_3\) to reduce unnecessary large calculations without losing mathematical essence or the concept of consecutive terms.
5.  **Ensure Coherence:** All additions are interdependent. The sequence definition and domain are fixed. The explicit translation condition constrains all parameters. The prime constraint on \(c\) adds a layer of modular arithmetic. Solving for possible products based on parameter constraints derived from both explicit conditions requires deeper logical inference.

We will show that $p=0$ or $q=0$. Consider the line $y=(q-p) x+p$ passing through $(0, p)$ and $(1, q)$; the latter are two points the line under consideration and the cubic $y^{2}=x^{3}+b x^{2}+c x+d$ share.

Then there is a small triangle in each pair. Without loss of generality, assume that triangles $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ and $D_{1} A_{1} B_{1}$ are small.

This contradicts the Lemma, applied for triangle $A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}$ inside $L K B$.\n\nCase 2. Ray $C_{1} D_{1}$ does not intersect $A B$. Then choose a ""sufficiently far"" point $K$ on ray $B A$ such that $\\left[K A_{1} C_{1}\\right]>\\left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}\\right]$, and that ray $K C_{1}$ intersects line $B C$ at some point $L$ (see Figure 5). Since ray $C_{1} D_{1}$ does not intersect line $A B$, the points $A$ and $D_{1}$ are on different sides of $K L$; then $A$ and $D$ are also on different sides, and $C$ is on the same side as $A$ and $B$.

- **Function properties**: The function \(f\) is surjective and maps \(\mathbb{N}\) to \(\mathbb{N}\).  
- **Variables**: \(m\) and \(n\) (elements of \(\mathbb{N}\)), and prime \(p\).  
- **Conditions**: For all \(m, n \in \mathbb{N}\) and all primes \(p\), divisibility by \(p\) holds: \(p \mid f(m+n)\) if and only if \(p \mid (f(m) + f(n))\).  
- **Theme**: The problem involves functional equations with a divisibility equivalence condition tied to prime numbers.  

#### Step 2  
**#Plan#**:  
1. **Change function property constraint**: Replace ""surjective"" with ""bijective"" to add injectivity as an additional requirement, reducing the solution space and increasing analytical depth.  
2. **Expand the number of variables**: Introduce a third variable \(k \in \mathbb{N}\) to extend the condition to sums of three elements, requiring that for every \(m, n, k \in \mathbb{N}\) and every prime \(p\), the divisibility equivalence must hold for \(f(m+n+k)\) and the sum \(f(m) + f(n) + f(k)\). This adds complexity by forcing consistency across more variables and relations.  
3. **Modify divisibility equivalence**: Instead of merely requiring equivalence modulo \(p\), strengthen it to require equivalence modulo \(p^2\). Specifically, for all \(m, n \in \mathbb{N}\) and all primes \(p\), \(f(m+n) \equiv f(m) + f(n) \pmod{p^2}\). This introduces higher-order divisibility constraints, making the condition stricter.  
- **Ensure coherence**: All modifications are logically interconnected. Bijectivity ensures the function is fully invertible, complementing the extended condition with three variables. The modulo \(p^2\) condition for two variables refines and tightens the original divisibility equivalence, providing a layered challenge.

We have $p \\mid f(x+(2 x d-x))=f(2 x d)$; moreover, since $d \\mid 2 x d+(y-x)=y+(2 x d-x)$, we get $p \\mid f(y+(2 x d-x))$. Then by the problem condition $p|f(x)+f(2 x d-x), p| f(y)+f(2 x d-x)$, and hence $f(x) \\equiv-f(2 x d-x) \\equiv f(y)$ $(\\bmod p)$.\n\nOn the other hand, assume that $f(x) \\equiv f(y)(\\bmod p)$. Again we have $p \\mid f(x)+f(2 x d-x)$ which by our assumption implies that $p \\mid f(x)+f(2 x d-x)+(f(y)-f(x))=f(y)+f(2 x d-x)$. Hence by the problem condition $p \\mid f(y+(2 x d-x))$.

If $n=1$ then, by the Lemma, $p \\nmid f(1)$ for any prime $p$, so $f(1)=1$, and the base is established. Suppose that $n>1$ and denote $k=f(n)$.

- **Conditions**: Meeting rules (opposite-direction ants turn 90° clockwise, perpendicular or >2 ants don't turn), movement speed constant at 1, ants fall off at edges.  
- **Participants**: Multiple ants placed at midpoints.  
- **Actions**: Movement initiation at time 0, directional changes upon specific collisions, falling off edges.  
- **Processes**: Ant interactions drive directional changes, affecting when they exit the grid.  
- **Theme**: Deterministic movement dynamics on a grid seeking worst-case exit time.  
- **Manipulation Targets**: Grid dimensionality (e.g., rectangular), direction rules (e.g., non-clockwise turns), ant heterogeneity (e.g., variable properties), environmental constraints (e.g., obstacles), or behavior dependencies (e.g., turn delays).  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
- **Modify Grid Dimensionality**: Change from square (m × m) to rectangular (m × n), introducing asymmetry and two variables, complicating edge distances and meeting probabilities.  
- **Add Turn Variability**: Replace fixed 90° clockwise turn with a counterclockwise turn if a newly introduced ""turn resistance"" factor r (for each ant, 0 ≤ r ≤ 1) exceeds 0.5, requiring tracking per-ant state; this links to initial positions.  
- **Introduce Obstacles**: Place immovable obstacles at unit squares, blocking paths; ants within distance d (d ≤ m/4) change direction to avoid them instantly, adding spatial dependencies and rerouting.  
- **Integrate Dependencies**: Turn resistance r is determined by r = (x + y)/max(m,n) where (x,y) is initial position, binding grid variables to ant properties. Obstacles and r affect meeting dynamics—e.g., ants may not turn if blocked. Ensure all elements interlock: grid size impacts r and obstacle avoidance, increasing combinatorial reasoning.  

Step 3  
#Rewritten Instruction#:  
Let $m$ and $n$ be positive integers and consider a rectangular grid of $m$ by $n$ unit squares. Some squares contain immovable obstacles, and at time 0, ants (at midpoints of non-obstacle squares) start moving parallel to an edge with speed 1. Each ant has a turn resistance $r = \frac{x + y}{\max(m,n)}$ for its initial position $(x,y)$. When two ants moving in opposite directions meet, both turn $90^\circ$ clockwise if $r \leq 0.5$ or counterclockwise if $r > 0.5$, then continue. If a meeting involves perpendicular directions or more than two ants, no turn occurs. Within distance $d = \lfloor \min(m,n)/4 \rfloor$ of an obstacle, an ant instantly turns $90^\circ$ clockwise to avoid it. Ants fall off at grid edges. Considering all starting positions, obstacles, and directions, determine the latest possible moment the last ant falls off or prove it may not exist.

For all initial setups, find the latest moment the last ant falls off or prove it may not exist.",success,28.26,"['For $m=1$ the answer is clearly correct, so assume $m>1$. In the sequel, the word collision will be used to denote meeting of exactly two ants, moving in opposite directions.\n\nIf at the beginning we place an ant on the southwest corner square facing east and an ant on the southeast corner square facing west, then they will meet in the middle of the bottom row at time $\\frac{m-1}{2}$. After the collision, the ant that moves to the north will stay on the board for another $m-\\frac{1}{2}$ time units and thus we have established an example in which the last ant falls off at time $\\frac{m-1}{2}+m-\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{3 m}{2}-1$. So, we are left to prove that this is the latest possible moment.\n\nConsider any collision of two ants $a$ and $a^{\\prime}$. Let us change the rule for this collision, and enforce these two ants to turn anticlockwise. Then the succeeding behavior of all the ants does not change; the only difference is that $a$ and $a^{\\prime}$ swap their positions. These arguments may be applied to any collision separately, so we may assume that at any collision, either both ants rotate clockwise or both of them rotate anticlockwise by our own choice.\n\nFor instance, we may assume that there are only two types of ants, depending on their initial direction: NE-ants, which move only north or east, and $S W$-ants, moving only south and west. Then we immediately obtain that all ants will have fallen off the board after $2 m-1$ time units. However, we can get a better bound by considering the last moment at which a given ant collides with another ant.\n\nChoose a coordinate system such that the corners of the checkerboard are $(0,0),(m, 0),(m, m)$ and $(0, m)$. At time $t$, there will be no NE-ants in the region $\\{(x, y): x+y<t+1\\}$ and no SW-ants in the region $\\{(x, y): x+y>2 m-t-1\\}$. So if two ants collide at $(x, y)$ at time $t$, we have\n\n$$\nt+1 \\leq x+y \\leq 2 m-t-1\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\n\n\nAnalogously, we may change the rules so that each ant would move either alternatingly north and west, or alternatingly south and east. By doing so, we find that apart from (11) we also have $|x-y| \\leq m-t-1$ for each collision at point $(x, y)$ and time $t$.\n\nTo visualize this, put\n\n$$\nB(t)=\\left\\{(x, y) \\in[0, m]^{2}: t+1 \\leq x+y \\leq 2 m-t-1 \\text { and }|x-y| \\leq m-t-1\\right\\}\n$$\n\nAn ant can thus only collide with another ant at time $t$ if it happens to be in the region $B(t)$. The following figure displays $B(t)$ for $t=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $t=\\frac{7}{2}$ in the case $m=6$ :\n\n<img_3463>\n\nNow suppose that an NE-ant has its last collision at time $t$ and that it does so at the point $(x, y)$ (if the ant does not collide at all, it will fall off the board within $m-\\frac{1}{2}<\\frac{3 m}{2}-1$ time units, so this case can be ignored). Then we have $(x, y) \\in B(t)$ and thus $x+y \\geq t+1$ and $x-y \\geq-(m-t-1)$. So we get\n\n$$\nx \\geq \\frac{(t+1)-(m-t-1)}{2}=t+1-\\frac{m}{2}\n$$\n\nBy symmetry we also have $y \\geq t+1-\\frac{m}{2}$, and hence $\\min \\{x, y\\} \\geq t+1-\\frac{m}{2}$. After this collision, the ant will move directly to an edge, which will take at $\\operatorname{most} m-\\min \\{x, y\\}$ units of time.

We begin with an example showing that there can exist 3986729 cells carrying the same positive number.\n\n<img_3188>\n\nTo describe it, we number the columns from the left to the right and the rows from the bottom to the top by $1,2, \\ldots, 2011$. We will denote each napkin by the coordinates of its lowerleft cell. There are four kinds of napkins: first, we take all napkins $(52 i+36,52 j+1)$ with $0 \\leq j \\leq i \\leq m-2$; second, we use all napkins $(52 i+1,52 j+36)$ with $0 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq m-2$; third, we use all napkins $(52 i+36,52 i+36)$ with $0 \\leq i \\leq m-2$; and finally the napkin $(1,1)$. Different groups of napkins are shown by different types of hatchings in the picture.\n\nNow except for those squares that carry two or more different hatchings, all squares have the number 1 written into them. The number of these exceptional cells is easily computed to be $\\left(52^{2}-35^{2}\\right) m-17^{2}=57392$.\n\nWe are left to prove that 3986729 is an upper bound for the number of cells containing the same number. Consider any configuration of napkins and any positive integer $M$. Suppose there are $g$ cells with a number different from $M$. Then it suffices to show $g \\geq 57392$. Throughout the solution, a line will mean either a row or a column.\n\nConsider any line $\\ell$. Let $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{52 m-17}$ be the numbers written into its consecutive cells. For $i=1,2, \\ldots, 52$, let $s_{i}=\\sum_{t \\equiv i(\\bmod 52)} a_{t}$. Note that $s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{35}$ have $m$ terms each, while $s_{36}, \\ldots, s_{52}$ have $m-1$ terms each. Every napkin intersecting $\\ell$ contributes exactly 1 to each $s_{i}$;\n\n\n\nhence the number $s$ of all those napkins satisfies $s_{1}=\\cdots=s_{52}=s$. Call the line $\\ell$ rich if $s>(m-1) M$ and poor otherwise.\n\nSuppose now that $\\ell$ is rich. Then in each of the sums $s_{36}, \\ldots, s_{52}$ there exists a term greater than $M$; consider all these terms and call the corresponding cells the rich bad cells for this line. So, each rich line contains at least 17 cells that are bad for this line.\n\nIf, on the other hand, $\\ell$ is poor, then certainly $s<m M$ so in each of the sums $s_{1}, \\ldots, s_{35}$ there exists a term less than $M$; consider all these terms and call the corresponding cells the poor bad cells for this line. So, each poor line contains at least 35 cells that are bad for this line.\n\nLet us call all indices congruent to $1,2, \\ldots$, or 35 modulo 52 small, and all other indices, i.e. those congruent to $36,37, \\ldots$, or 52 modulo 52 , big. Recall that we have numbered the columns from the left to the right and the rows from the bottom to the top using the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, 52 m-17$; we say that a line is big or small depending on whether its index is big or small. By definition, all rich bad cells for the rows belong to the big columns, while the poor ones belong to the small columns, and vice versa.\n\nIn each line, we put a strawberry on each cell that is bad for this line. In addition, for each small rich line we put an extra strawberry on each of its (rich) bad cells. A cell gets the strawberries from its row and its column independently.\n\nNotice now that a cell with a strawberry on it contains a number different from $M$. If this cell gets a strawberry by the extra rule, then it contains a number greater than $M$. Moreover, it is either in a small row and in a big column, or vice versa. Suppose that it is in a small row, then it is not bad for its column. So it has not more than two strawberries in this case. On the other hand, if the extra rule is not applied to some cell, then it also has not more than two strawberries. So, the total number $N$ of strawberries is at most $2 g$.\n\nWe shall now estimate $N$ in a different way. For each of the $2 \\cdot 35 \\mathrm{~m}$ small lines, we have introduced at least 34 strawberries if it is rich and at least 35 strawberries if it is poor, so at least 34 strawberries in any case. Similarly, for each of the $2 \\cdot 17(m-1)$ big lines, we put at least $\\min (17,35)=17$ strawberries. Summing over all lines we obtain\n\n$$\n2 g \\geq N \\geq 2(35 m \\cdot 34+17(m-1) \\cdot 17)=2(1479 m-289)=2 \\cdot 57392\n$$\n\nas desired.'
 'We present a different proof of the estimate which is the hard part of the problem. Let $S=35, H=17, m=39$; so the table size is $2011=S m+H(m-1)$, and the napkin size is $52=S+H$. Fix any positive integer $M$ and call a cell vicious if it contains a number distinct\n\n\n\nfrom $M$. We will prove that there are at least $H^{2}(m-1)+2 S H m$ vicious cells.\n\nFirstly, we introduce some terminology. As in the previous solution, we number rows and columns and we use the same notions of small and big indices and lines; so, an index is small if it is congruent to one of the numbers $1,2, \\ldots, S$ modulo $(S+H)$. The numbers $1,2, \\ldots, S+H$ will be known as residues. For two residues $i$ and $j$, we say that a cell is of type $(i, j)$ if the index of its row is congruent to $i$ and the index of its column to $j$ modulo $(S+H)$. The number of vicious cells of this type is denoted by $v_{i j}$.\n\nLet $s, s^{\\prime}$ be two variables ranging over small residues and let $h, h^{\\prime}$ be two variables ranging over big residues. A cell is said to be of class $A, B, C$, or $D$ if its type is of shape $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right),(s, h),(h, s)$, or $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, respectively. The numbers of vicious cells belonging to these classes are denoted in this order by $a, b, c$, and $d$. Observe that each cell belongs to exactly one class.\n\nClaim 1. We have\n\n$$\nm \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b+c}{2 S H}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nProof. Consider an arbitrary small row $r$. Denote the numbers of vicious cells on $r$ belonging to the classes $A$ and $B$ by $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, respectively. As in the previous solution, we obtain that $\\alpha \\geq S$ or $\\beta \\geq H$. So in each case we have $\\frac{\\alpha}{S}+\\frac{\\beta}{H} \\geq 1$.\n\nPerforming this argument separately for each small row and adding up all the obtained inequalities, we get $\\frac{a}{S}+\\frac{b}{H} \\geq m S$. Interchanging rows and columns we similarly get $\\frac{a}{S}+\\frac{c}{H} \\geq m S$. Summing these inequalities and dividing by $2 S$ we get what we have claimed.\n\nClaim 2. Fix two small residue $s, s^{\\prime}$ and two big residues $h, h^{\\prime}$. Then $2 m-1 \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+v_{s h^{\\prime}}+v_{h h^{\\prime}}$. Proof. Each napkin covers exactly one cell of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$. Removing all napkins covering a vicious cell of this type, we get another collection of napkins, which covers each cell of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$ either 0 or $M$ times depending on whether the cell is vicious or not. Hence $\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M$ napkins are left and throughout the proof of Claim 2 we will consider only these remaining napkins. Now, using a red pen, write in each cell the number of napkins covering it. Notice that a cell containing a red number greater than $M$ is surely vicious.\n\nWe call two cells neighbors if they can be simultaneously covered by some napkin. So, each cell of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ has not more than four neighbors of type $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$, while each cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ has not more than two neighbors of each of the types $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}\\right)$ and $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$. Therefore, each red number at a cell of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $4 M$, while each red number at a cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $2 M$.\n\nLet $x, y$, and $z$ be the numbers of cells of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ whose red number belongs to $(M, 2 M]$, $(2 M, 3 M]$, and $(3 M, 4 M]$, respectively. All these cells are vicious, hence $x+y+z \\leq v_{h h^{\\prime}}$. The red numbers appearing in cells of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ clearly sum up to $\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M$. Bounding each of these numbers by a multiple of $M$ we get\n\n$$\n\\left(m^{2}-v_{s s^{\\prime}}\\right) M \\leq\\left((m-1)^{2}-(x+y+z)\\right) M+2 x M+3 y M+4 z M\n$$\n\n\n\ni.e.\n\n$$\n2 m-1 \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+x+2 y+3 z \\leq v_{s s^{\\prime}}+v_{h h^{\\prime}}+y+2 z\n$$\n\nSo, to prove the claim it suffices to prove that $y+2 z \\leq v_{s h^{\\prime}}$.\n\nFor a cell $\\delta$ of type $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ and a cell $\\beta$ of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ we say that $\\delta$ forces $\\beta$ if there are more than $M$ napkins covering both of them. Since each red number in a cell of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ does not exceed $2 M$, it cannot be forced by more than one cell.\n\nOn the other hand, if a red number in a $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$-cell belongs to $(2 M, 3 M]$, then it forces at least one of its neighbors of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$ (since the sum of red numbers in their cells is greater than $2 M)$. Analogously, an $\\left(h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$-cell with the red number in $(3 M, 4 M]$ forces both its neighbors of type $\\left(s, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, since their red numbers do not exceed $2 M$. Therefore there are at least $y+2 z$ forced cells and clearly all of them are vicious, as desired.\n\nClaim 3. We have\n\n$$\n2 m-1 \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b+c}{2 S H}+\\frac{d}{H^{2}}\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nProof. Averaging the previous result over all $S^{2} H^{2}$ possibilities for the quadruple $\\left(s, s^{\\prime}, h, h^{\\prime}\\right)$, we get $2 m-1 \\leq \\frac{a}{S^{2}}+\\frac{b}{S H}+\\frac{d}{H^{2}}$. Due to the symmetry between rows and columns, the same estimate holds with $b$ replaced by $c$. Averaging these two inequalities we arrive at our claim.\n\nNow let us multiply (2) by $H^{2}$, multiply (II) by $\\left(2 S H-H^{2}\\right)$ and add them; we get\n\n$H^{2}(2 m-1)+\\left(2 S H-H^{2}\\right) m \\leq a \\cdot \\frac{H^{2}+2 S H-H^{2}}{S^{2}}+(b+c) \\frac{H^{2}+2 S H-H^{2}}{2 S H}+d=a \\cdot \\frac{2 H}{S}+b+c+d$.\n\nThe left-hand side is exactly $H^{2}(m-1)+2 S H m$, while the right-hand side does not exceed $a+b+c+d$ since $2 H \\leq S$. Hence we come to the desired inequality.']"

**#Elements Identified#:**  
- **Variables:** 100 nonnegative real numbers \(x_1, \dots, x_{100}\) with cyclic boundaries (\(x_{101} = x_1, x_{102} = x_2\)).  
- **Constraints:** \(x_i + x_{i+1} + x_{i+2} \leq 1\) for all \(i = 1, \dots, 100\).  
- **Objective:** Maximize the sum \(S = \sum_{i=1}^{100} x_i x_{i+2}\).  
- **Theme:** Cyclic optimization under local linear constraints.  

**Step 2**  
**#Plan#:**  
1. **Modify the objective function** to incorporate multiple dependent products, adding a paired term \(\sum x_i x_{i+1}\) and coefficients, increasing algebraic interdependence.  
2. **Introduce asymmetric constraints** by replacing the uniform upper bound 1 with residue-dependent bounds \(c_i\), varying constraints modulo 4.  
3. **Add coefficient tables** for the objective and constraints, requiring case analysis and deeper combinatorial reasoning.  
4. **Maintain cyclic boundaries** and nonnegativity while ensuring all additions are logically integrated.  

**Step 3**  
**#Rewritten Instruction#:**  
Let \(x_1, \ldots, x_{100}\) be nonnegative real numbers with cyclic boundaries \(x_{101} = x_1, x_{102} = x_2\). For each \(i\), define coefficients and constraints by the table below based on \(i \mod 4\):
