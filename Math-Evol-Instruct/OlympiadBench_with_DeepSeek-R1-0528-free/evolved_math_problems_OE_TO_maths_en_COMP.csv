#Elements Identified#:
1.  **Core Concept:** Arithmetic sequences in rows and columns of an infinite table.
2.  **Variables:**
    *   `R`: Row index (positive integer)
    *   `C`: Column index (positive integer)
3.  **Structure:**
    *   First row starts at 4, column step `c_step1` (to be determined).
    *   First column starts at 4, row step `r_step1` (to be determined).
4.  **Theme:** Finding a closed-form expression `f(R, C)` for the entry at row `R`, column `C`.
5.  **Complexity Basis:** Basic arithmetic sequences with constant row/column starting points and step sizes inferred from initial values.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Replace fixed starting points with variable offsets:** Introduce distinct starting values `S_i` for the i-th row and `S_j` for the j-th column, defined as arithmetic sequences themselves.
2.  **Generalize step sizes:** Replace fixed step sizes within rows/columns with variable step sizes `d_i` for the i-th row's sequence and `d_j` for the j-th column's sequence, defined as linear functions of the row/column index.
3.  **Add non-primality constraint in early rows:** Leverage the Sieve of Sundaram's prime-removal purpose. Add the condition that no number in the first `K` rows (where `K` is a given function of `C_0`) of the table can be prime. This links the sequences defining `S_i`, `S_j`, `d_i`, `d_j` through primality constraints, significantly increasing complexity but keeping the theme. `C_0` is an introduced constant.
4.  **Logical Connection:** The generalized starting points `S_i`, `S_j` and step sizes `d_i`, `d_j` are interconnected through the requirement that the sequences form a consistent table *and* satisfy the prime exclusion rule for small rows. `R`, `C`, `C_0`, `K` are core variables.

The step size within the i-th row is `d_i = 2Ki`, and within the j-th column is `d_j = 2Kj` (where `K > 1` is a given integer).

*   **Objective:** Find position (x, y) after n moves fulfilling total distance.
*   **Theme:** Displacement via cyclic directional changes with linearly increasing step sizes.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Increase Angular Complexity:** Replace fixed 90° clockwise turn with a turn angle that increases incrementally by a fixed amount α each move. This creates an outward spiral path instead of a closed pattern. (e.g., Turn = 90° + (n-1)*α)
2.  **Vary Move Length:** Instead of fixed n units, define the length of move n as proportional to the distance from the origin *before* the move starts, plus an increasing linear term. This makes the step size dependent on the entire path history. (e.g., Length_n = k * √(x_{n-1}² + y_{n-1}²) + f(n), where f(n) could be linear or quadratic).
3.  **Modify Known Quantity & Objective:** Change the condition from knowing the *total distance traveled* (which simplifies to n(n+1)/2=55) to finding *when the distance from the origin is maximized* for a given move number n. This requires tracking the radial distance throughout the complex path and finding its peak.
4.  **Ensure Interconnection:** The variable turn angle continuously alters the direction, causing a spiral.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Replace explicit term values with derived ratios:** Instead of providing `t_3` and `t_{n-2}` directly, relate them to other terms using ratios or differences. Replace `t_3 = 5` with a condition linking `t_1` and `d` (e.g., via `t_3/t_1` or `t_3/t_2`) while keeping the underlying numerical value ""5"" inherent. Similarly, replace `t_{n-2} = 95` with a condition linking `t_n` and `d` (e.g., `t_n/t_{n-2}` or `t_{n-1}/t_{n-2}`) while preserving the value ""95"". This adds algebraic manipulation complexity and hides known constants within conditions.
2.  **Add a constraint involving the median term and the sum:** Introduce the median term (or an average) and relate it directly to the sum using the arithmetic sequence property. State that the `(⌈n/2⌉)-th` term (`t_m`) satisfies a condition with `S_n`, requiring solvers to utilize both the sum formula and the term formula concurrently in a specific way.
3.  **Impose a coprimality restriction:** Add a condition that `n` and the absolute value of the common difference `|d|` must be coprime. This demands number-theoretic consideration (gcd=1) during the solution process, ensuring `d` is not trivially eliminated and linking the sequence structure directly to divisibility conditions.
4.  **Ensure Interconnection:** The values derived in step (1) and the constraint in step (2) should logically lead back to the original constants (5 and 95) and the sum (1000). The coprimality constraint in step (3) will restrict the set of possible solutions resulting from the relations established in steps (1) and (2). All elements must work together to solve for `n`.

#Elements Identified#:
*   **Participants:** Two fair, standard dice.
*   **Dice Structure:** Each has 6 faces labeled distinctly with integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

*   **Event/Outcome:** Product of the two face-up numbers.

*   **Calculation:** Probability determination.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Increase Dice Count:** Modify from two dice to four dice to significantly enlarge the sample space and product possibilities. (Participant modification)
2.  **Vary Dice Specifications:** Introduce non-uniform dice (different face numbering/range) and distinguish them by color to add constraints and break symmetry. (Structure modification). Specifically: two blue dice numbered 1-6, two red dice numbered 2-8. This increases complexity through varied probability densities.
3.  **Add Compound Divisibility Conditions:** Replace the single divisibility condition (by 5) with a requirement for divisibility by *both* 2 *and* 5 to increase the reasoning steps needed (identifying common factors). (Condition modification).
4.  **Maintain Interconnection:** The four dice multiply together. The mixed numbering affects probability distribution. Divisibility by both 2 and 5 is equivalent to divisibility by 10, but identifying the conditions for each die contributing the factors is more complex. Theme consistency is retained (multiplicative outcome, divisibility condition, discrete uniform-ish probability).

If each linear dimension is increased by \(n\%\) and each resolution is decreased by \(2n\%\), the image has 328,125 pixels. Determine \(n\).","### Step 1  
**#Elements Identified#**:  
- Variables: original dimensions (width and height in cm), horizontal and vertical resolutions (pixels/cm), percentage change (\(n\)), original pixel count, new pixel count.  
- Processes: Increase in linear dimensions by \(n\%\), decrease in resolutions by \(2n\%\), calculation of total pixels before and after changes.  
- Constraints: Symmetric change in linear dimensions (both width and height increased by same \(n\%\)), symmetric change in resolutions (both horizontal and vertical resolutions decreased by same \(2n\%\)), relationship between percentage changes.  
- Theme: Digital image properties and proportional changes affecting total pixel count.  

### Step 2  
**#Plan#**:  
1. **Introduce distinct resolutions**: Separate horizontal and vertical resolutions instead of a single symmetric resolution. Use different values (80 pixels/cm horizontal, 70 pixels/cm vertical) to require handling of distinct components.  
2. **Modify percentage dependency**: Change the resolution decrease to \(2n\%\) while keeping the dimension increase at \(n\%\), introducing a multiplicative factor (2x) in the decrease magnitude.  
3. **Adjust constants for exact solvability**: Set original dimensions as 10 cm × 15 cm, resolutions as 80 and 70 pixels/cm respectively (original pixel count becomes 840,000). Set new pixel count to 328,125, derived from solving \(16x^2 + 8x - 3 = 0\) (resulting in \(n = 25\)), ensuring integer percentage solution and algebraic complexity.  
4. **Maintain coherence**: Ensure resolutions are independently specified, and changes are symmetrically applied within their categories. The change dependency (\(2n\%\)) increases algebraic complexity while preserving logical cause-effect relationships.

3. **Impose a global structural rule**: Require that every even integer in the sequence is immediately preceded and followed by two distinct odd integers.

1.  **Introduce Composite Structure:** Replace the single variable `a` with two prime factors forming a composite `a` (i.e., `a = a1 * a2`, where `a1`, `a2` are distinct primes).
2.  **Modify the Difference Constraint:** Replace the simple difference `b - a = 15` with an absolute difference involving the composite variable and a multiplier (e.g., `|b - 3a| <= N` where `N` is reasonably small).
3.  **Tighten the Bounds:** Reduce the interval width where `a/b` must lie, specifically shifting it closer to one of the critical boundaries (`4/7`).
4.  **Add Constraints on New Variables:** Specifically require both primes `a1` and `a2` to be less than `10` and impose a coprimality condition between `a1`, `a2`, and `b`.
5.  **Link Complexity:** The composite `a` ties into the modulus condition and the new coprimality chain. Tighter bounds require more precise solution verification.

#Elements Identified#:  
- Participants: Alain, Bianca, Chen, Dave.  
- Tournament structure: Three matches total; initial round with two matches between paired players, followed by a final match between the two winners.  
- Initial pairing: Originally chosen randomly from all three possible pairings.  
- Match probabilities: Among Alain, Bianca, Chen, any two are equally matched (win probability 1/2 for each). Dave vs. any of Alain, Bianca, or Chen: Dave wins with probability p (opponent wins with 1-p).  
- Objective: Probability that Bianca wins the tournament, expressed as a quadratic fraction in p.  
- Key variables: Real number p for Dave's win probability.  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
1. **Modify initial pairing constraint**: Replace the all-random pairing with a constrained pairing to avoid Alain vs. Bianca in the first round, reducing the possibilities to two equally likely configurations instead of three. This increases complexity by forcing conditioning on distinct paths.  
2. **Retain probabilistic framework**: Keep the 1/2 win probability for matches among Alain, Bianca, Chen and the p-dependent win probability for Dave's matches without alteration to focus on the structural change.  
3. **Ensure interconnectedness**: The new pairing constraint alters Bianca's possible opponents in the first round and the subsequent paths to victory, creating more intricate case analyses while preserving coherence with the existing match probabilities and tournament rules.  
4. **Maintain answer form**: The probability will still be expressible as \(\frac{a p^{2} + b p + c}{d}\), ensuring algebraic complexity aligns with the requirement.

State the time B detects the sound and that the time *differences* (not arrivals) AB, AC, AD are known relative to B (e.g., TB - TA = 0.5s, TB - TC = ?s, TB - TD = ?s).

(A positive divisor of 900 is a positive integer that divides exactly into 900.)","Given `k = 3^m * 5^n` where `m` and `n` are the smallest positive integers making `k` a perfect square, determine the number of its positive divisors (counting 1 and `k`) that are perfect sixth powers and satisfy both `d ≡ 1 (mod 7)` and `d ≡ 4 (mod 11)`.","Step 1
#Elements Identified#:
*   **Base Number:** 900 (a constant).
*   **Target:** Number of positive divisors.
*   **Requirements on Divisors:** Must be perfect squares.
*   **Inclusivity Clause:** Includes 1 and the number itself (900).
*   **Underlying Process:** Requires prime factorization of 900 (900 = 2² * 3² * 5²) and finding divisors where all exponents in their prime factorization are even.
*   **Theme:** Combinatorial counting of divisors satisfying a multiplicative constraint.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Complexify the Base Number:** Replace the constant 900 with an expression defining a variable perfect square (`3^m * 5^n` where `m` and `n` are the smallest positive integers making it a perfect square). This forces reasoning about the exponents themselves.
2.  **Introduce an Additional Requirement on the Divisors:** Require the divisor to be a *perfect cube* in addition to a perfect square, making it a sixth power. This adds a layer of combinatorial constraint (exponents must be multiples of 6).
3.  **Add Constraints on the Divisors:** Impose that these special divisors (sixth powers) must satisfy two separate congruence conditions simultaneously (leaving specific remainders when divided by two different primes, like 7 and 11). This requires solving systems of congruences for the divisors.
4.  **Ensure Interconnection & Justification:**
    *   The base expression (`3^m * 5^n`) naturally leads to its prime factorization (`m` and `n` must be even => base = 3^(even) * 5^(even) is a perfect square).
    *   The divisor constraint (both square and cube => sixth power) inherently relates to the exponents in *its* factorization (which must be multiples of 6).
    *   The congruence conditions (`≡ 1 mod 7` and `≡ 4 mod 11`) act on the numerical values of the divisors derived from the exponent constraints. They are standard modulus congruences requiring application of the Chinese Remainder Theorem or inspection.

Expanding this product yields $\\left(x^{2}-5\\right)\\left(x^{2}-45\\right)=x^{4}-50 x^{2}+225$, so $j=-50$.'
 'Proceed as in the original solution, finding the values $-3 \\sqrt{5},-\\sqrt{5}, \\sqrt{5}$, and $3 \\sqrt{5}$ for the zeros. By the sums and products of roots formulas, the coefficient of $x^{2}$ is the sum of all six possible products of pairs of roots:\n\n$$\n(-3 \\sqrt{5})(-\\sqrt{5})+(-3 \\sqrt{5})(\\sqrt{5})+(-3 \\sqrt{5})(3 \\sqrt{5})+(-\\sqrt{5})(\\sqrt{5})+(-\\sqrt{5})(3 \\sqrt{5})+(\\sqrt{5})(3 \\sqrt{5})\n$$\n\nObserving that some of these terms will cancel yields the simpler expression\n\n$$\n(-3 \\sqrt{5})(3 \\sqrt{5})+(-\\sqrt{5})(\\sqrt{5})=-45+-5=-50\n$$']"
