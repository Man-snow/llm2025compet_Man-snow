#Elements Identified#:
- **Variables**: Convex quadrilaterals \(P\) and \(P^{\prime}\), their intersecting point \(O\), lines \(\ell\) through \(O\), chord segments \(\ell \cap P\) and \(\ell \cap P^{\prime}\), area ratio \(\frac{\text{area}(P^{\prime})}{\text{area}(P)}\).
- **Condition**: For every line \(\ell\) through \(O\), the length of \(\ell \cap P\) is strictly greater than the length of \(\ell \cap P^{\prime}\).
- **Original Query**: Investigate if the area ratio can exceed 1.9.
- **Theme**: Geometric constraints on quadrilaterals involving chord lengths and area ratios, with the core of comparing the ""magnitude"" of the sets relative to a common point.
- **Proof Focus**: The original is a yes/no proof-based question.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. **Transform Proof to Computation**: Instead of a threshold (1.9), compute the supremum of the ratio \(\frac{\text{area}(P^{\prime})}{\text{area}(P)}\) over all valid \((P, P^{\prime}, O)\), which requires determining a precise numerical limit, not a binary outcome.
2. **Increase Dimensionality**: Generalize from quadrilaterals to \(n\)-sided convex polygons and ask for the \(n\)-dependent supremum. This introduces integer parameters and sequences, necessitates computation for variable \(n\), and links to asymptotic analysis.
3. **Add Real-World Constraints**: Require \(O\) to be the centroid of both polygons (imposing symmetry), which intensifies constraints and refines the supremum calculation.
4. **Optimization Focus**: Demand the supremum as a function of \(n\) and specify computation for large \(n\) and the limit, forcing advanced techniques (e.g., supporting functions, isoperimetric inequalities) and combining geometry with limit theory.
5. **Complexity Justification**: Centroid constraints and polygon generality maintain theme coherence while elevating difficulty via additional dependencies and numerical optimization. Avoid trivial cases by anchoring to arbitrary \(n\) and infimum computation.

**#Elements Identified#:**
- **Participants:** Workers (fixed number: 17).
- **Structure:** Workers in a row; contiguous groups of ≥2 workers defined as ""brigades"".
- **Actions:** Assign a leader to each brigade (leader must be a member of the brigade).
- **Conditions:** Each worker's total number of leader assignments must be divisible by 4.
- **Goal:** Prove the number of valid assignment schemes is divisible by 17.
- **Theme:** Combinatorial assignment with divisibility constraints and prime-related conclusion.

Step 2
**#Plan#:**
1. **Generalize workers:** Replace fixed 17 workers with a variable \(n\) (set to a large computable value: \(n = 1000\)).  
2. **Add constraint layers:**  
   - Modify the ""assignment condition"": Require each worker \(i\)'s assignments to be divisible by \(\gcd(i + k, m)\) for introduced \(k, m\) (adds positional dependency).  
   - Impose a global ""overlap constraint"": For every set of \(k\) overlapping/consecutive brigades, leaders must be distinct (prevents trivial assignments).  
3. **Increase computational complexity:**  
   - Demand the exact number of valid assignments modulo a large prime (\(10^9 + 7\)) instead of a divisibility proof.  
   - Introduce an auxiliary variable \(k = 3\) to define the overlap constraint and positional divisor (\(\gcd(i+1, 4)\)).

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Specify Geometry:** Fix $A$ at the origin $(0,0)$ and the angle bisector $\overrightarrow{AD}$ as the positive x-axis to enable coordinate computation.
2.  **Define Angles:** Introduce specific fixed angles: $\angle ABC = \beta^\circ$ and $\angle ACB = \gamma^\circ$, and make the half-angle of $\angle BAC$ a variable $\theta$ (where $\theta = \alpha/2$). Add the constraint $AB = AC$ (implicitly defining $\beta = \gamma$) to force isosceles symmetry which the original problem inherently exploits, making the computational reliance on it explicit. The computation will need to derive all positions based on $\theta, \beta, \gamma$.
3.  **Set Scaling/Constraint:** Fix the distance $AD = k$ units to define scale. Introduce the constraint that $D$ is fixed on the x-axis as $(d, 0)$ for computation, implying $k$ is a known parameter. This forces algebraic determination of point $B$ and $C$ coordinates based on angles and the touch point.
4.  **Computational Goal:** Instead of proving location, require calculation of the circumradius $R$ of $\triangle AJ_bJ_c$.
5.  **Final Complexity Boost:** Require computing the exact numerical value of $R$ for specific angle values ($\beta$, $\gamma$) and $d$, under the condition $AB = AC$ (i.e., $\theta = 90^\circ - \beta$), moving beyond the original symmetric case into a more general symmetric setup demanding involved coordinate geometry and circle equations. The dependence on $\theta$ derived from $\beta$ forces integrating the constraint explicitly into calculations.

#Elements Identified#:
- Participants: Non-constant polynomials $P(x)$, $Q(x)$, $R(x)$, $S(x)$ with real coefficients.
- Conditions: $P(Q(x)) = R(S(x))$, degree of $P$ divisible by degree of $R$.
- Processes: Prove existence of polynomial $T(x)$ such that $P(x) = R(T(x))$ using polynomial composition and degree relations.
- Theme: Polynomial functional equations based on degrees and composition, with real coefficients.

Step 2
#Plan#:
- Concretize degrees: Set large, specific degrees for $P$ and $R$—$ \deg(P) = 30 $, $ \deg(R) = 5 $—to force computational rigor, implying $ \deg(T) = \deg(P)/\deg(R) = 6 $.
- Specify $Q$ and $S$ to satisfy degree constraints: Choose $Q(x) = x^2 + 1$ (degree 2) so $S$ must have degree $ \frac{\deg(P) \cdot \deg(Q)}{\deg(R)} = \frac{30 \cdot 2}{5} = 12 $; define $S(x) = 2x^{12} + 3x^6 + 1 $.
- Add restrictive coefficient bounds: Require all polynomials to have integer coefficients within $[-10, 10]$, and $P$, $R$ monic to reduce ambiguity.
- Transform to computational task: Instead of proving existence, ask for the minimal possible constant term of $T(x)$ over all valid $P$ and $R$, making it numerical and optimization-based to increase difficulty.

If $f(x)$ is a monic polynomial of degree $m n$, then there exists a degree $n$ monic polynomial $g(x)$ such that $\\operatorname{deg}\\left(f(x)-g(x)^{m}\\right)<(m-1) n$. (If $m=0$ or 1 , or $n=0$, the conclusion is still consistent with the usual convention that the identically zero polynomial has degree $-\\infty$.)\n\n\n\nProof. Write $f(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^{m n} \\alpha_{k} x^{k}, \\alpha_{m n}=1$, and seek $g(x)=\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\beta_{k} x^{k}, \\beta_{n}=1$, so as to fit the bill.

Suppose, if possible, that $c>1$. By the lemma, there exist monic polynomials $U(x)$ and $V(x)$ of degree $b$ and $a$, respectively, such that $\\operatorname{deg}\\left(P(x)-U(x)^{c}\\right)<(c-1) b$ and $\\operatorname{deg}(R(x)-$ $\\left.V(x)^{c}\\right)<(c-1) a$.

This forces $U(Q(x))=V(S(x))$, so $U(Q(x))=V(S(x))$ has degree $a b d<a b c d=$ $\\operatorname{deg} F(x)$ - a contradiction. Consequently, $c=1$.

- Ensure coherence: All changes are interconnected—the symmetric point set ensures tractability for computation, while distinct areas and strict inequalities enforce uniqueness, and the parameter \(k\) expands the definition naturally.

**#Elements Identified#:**
- **Points**: $n$ distinct points in Euclidean 3-dimensional space, with the condition that no four are coplanar.
- **Partition**: The points are partitioned into two subsets $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$, specified by their sizes (optional but unstated).
- **AB-tree**: A configuration of $n-1$ segments where each segment connects one point from $\mathcal{A}$ to one from $\mathcal{B}$ and forms a tree (no closed polylines).
- **Transformation**: Defined by selecting three distinct segments forming a specific path (A-B-A-B) with vertices $A_1 \in \mathcal{A}$, $B_1 \in \mathcal{B}$, $A_2 \in \mathcal{A}$, $B_2 \in \mathcal{B}$, satisfying the distance inequality $d(A_1, B_1) + d(A_2, B_2) > d(A_1, B_2) + d(A_2, B_1)$. Then, the segment $A_1 B_1$ is removed and replaced by $A_1 B_2$.
- **Termination Proof**: The goal is to prove that any sequence of such transformations terminates after finitely many steps for any initial AB-tree.
- **General Theme**: Combinatorial geometry and metric properties of trees with applications to optimization.

### Step 2
**#Plan#:**
1. **Modify the Initial Setup**: Replace the 3-dimensional space with 4-dimensional Euclidean space to increase geometric complexity and require specific coordinates involving irrational numbers to prevent symmetries and ensure no five points are cospherical (maintaining general position).
2. **Introduce Weights and Additional Constraints**: Assign non-Euclidean weights to the distances (e.g., using Manhattan distance instead of Euclidean) and impose that $|\mathcal{A}| = |\mathcal{B}| + 1$ (odd-size partition), forcing asymmetric tree structures. This adds dependencies between variables and complicates distance calculations.
3.  **Reorient Towards Computation with Specific Output**: Instead of a proof, ask for a difficult-to-compute numerical output: the exact number of transformations required in the longest possible sequence for a fixed, complex point set ($n=6$ with given coordinates) and specific partition and initial tree. This requires exhaustive case analysis or combinatorial reasoning under constraints, leveraging the transformation's impact on tree topology and weights.
4. **Ensure Logical Coherence**: Connect the weights and partition constraint to the transformation inequality (e.g., Manhattan distance changes the validity of swaps). Maintain the AB-tree structure and termination property, but now the computational focus is on quantifying the process steps under harder settings, avoiding triviality (no small n).

**Step 2**  
#Plan#:  
1. **Transform to computational**: Replace the proof with counting the number of solutions \(n\) below a large bound \(N = 10^{10}\).  
2. **Increase complexity**:  
   - Add constraints: Both \(n\) and \(n+1\) must be square-free (positive integers without squared prime factors) and satisfy \(\omega(n)\) even (disjoint from \(\Omega(n)\) but related).  
   - Incorporate a non-trivial dependency: Use the distinct prime factor count function \(\omega(n)\) to refine the Liouville sign condition and introduce sieving challenges.  
   - Specify concrete large \(N\) to force advanced computational methods (sieving, bounds on prime counts).  
3. **Justify components**:  
   - Square-free ensures \(\Omega(n) = \omega(n)\), simplifying \(\lambda(n)\) but making sequences rarer.  
   - Even \(\omega(n)\) implies \(\lambda(n) = +1\), linking to the original, but joint conditions (\(n\) and \(n+1\)) require handling correlations in prime factor distributions.

 'We will prove the following, more general statement:\n\n\n\nClaim. Write down a finite number (at least two) of pairwise distinct positive integers on a board. A move consists in erasing any two numbers $a$ and $b$, and, for each $c$ in $\\{a+b,|a-b|\\}$, writing $c$ down on the board, unless $c$ is already there; if $c$ is already on the board, do nothing. Then it is possible to be left with exactly two numbers on the board after a finite number of moves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that, if we divide all numbers on the board by some common factor, the resulting process goes on equally well. Such a reduction can therefore be performed after any move.\n\n\n\nNotice that we cannot be left with less than two numbers. So it suffices to show that, given $k$ positive integers on the board, $k \\geq 3$, we can always decrease their number by at least 1 . Arguing indirectly, choose a set of $k \\geq 3$ positive integers $S=\\left\\{a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{k}\\right\\}$ which cannot be reduced in size by a sequence of moves, having a minimal possible sum $\\sigma$. So, in any sequence of moves applied to $S$, two numbers are erased and exactly two numbers appear on each move. Moreover, the sum of any resulting set of $k$ numbers is at least $\\sigma$.\n\n\n\nNotice that, given two numbers $a>b$ on the board, we can replace them by $a+b$ and $a-b$, and then, performing a move on the two new numbers, by $(a+b)+(a-b)=2 a$ and $(a+b)-(a-b)=2 b$. So we can double any two numbers on the board.\n\n\n\nWe now show that, if the board contains two even numbers $a$ and $b$, we can divide them both by 2 , while keeping the other numbers unchanged. If $k$ is even, split the other numbers into pairs to multiply each pair by 2 ; then clear out the common factor 2 . If $k$ is odd, split all numbers but $a$ into pairs to multiply each by 2 ; then do the same for all numbers but $b$; finally, clear out the common factor 4.\n\n\n\nBack to the problem, if two of the numbers $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{k}$ are even, reduce them both by 2 to get a set with a smaller sum, which is impossible. Otherwise, two numbers, say, $a_{1}<a_{2}$, are odd, and we may replace them by the two even numbers $a_{1}+a_{2}$ and $a_{2}-a_{1}$, and then by $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(a_{1}+a_{2}\\right)$ and $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(a_{2}-a_{1}\\right)$, to get a set with a smaller sum, which is again impossible.']"

3. **Add dependencies/constraints**: Citizen placement influences viability; the count of valid kingdoms must allow placement of \(3n^2 + 3n + 1\) citizens with distance \(\geq 1\).  
4. **Ensure computability but non-trivial difficulty**: For \(n=1\), boundary cases are simple, so use \(n\) as is and request a specific count demanding recursive area-based arms creating.

Let $P$ be a convex polygon satisfying the problem conditions - i.e., it has integer sides, perimeter $6 n$, and $60^{\\circ}$ rotational symmetry.

Induct on $n$. The base case, $n=1$, is clear.\n\n\n\nNow take a polygon $P$ of perimeter $6 n \\geq 12$. Place six equilateral triangles inwards on six edges corresponding to each other upon rotation at $60^{\\circ}$.

 'We will show that there exists a tester pair of bijective functions $g$ and $h$.\n\n\n\nFirst of all, let us find out when a pair of functions is a tester pair.

We construct a directed graph $G_{g, h}$ with $\\mathbb{R}$ as the set of vertices, its edges being painted with two colors: for every vertex $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we introduce a red edge $x \\rightarrow g(x)$ and a blue edge $x \\rightarrow h(x)$.\n\n\n\nNow, assume that the function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ satisfies $f(g(x))=g(f(x))$ and $f(h(x))=h(f(x))$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This means exactly that if there exists an edge $x \\rightarrow y$, then there also exists an edge $f(x) \\rightarrow f(y)$ of the same color; that is $-f$ is an endomorphism of $G_{g, h}$.\n\n\n\nThus, a pair $(g, h)$ is a tester pair if and only if the graph $G_{g, h}$ admits no nontrivial endomorphisms. Notice that each endomorphism maps a component into a component. Thus, to construct a tester pair, it suffices to construct a continuum of components with no nontrivial endomorphisms and no homomorphisms from one to another. It can be done in many ways; below we present one of them.\n\n\n\nLet $g(x)=x+1$; the construction of $h$ is more involved. For every $x \\in[0,1)$ we define the set $S_{x}=x+\\mathbb{Z}$; the sets $S_{x}$ will be exactly the components of $G_{g, h}$.

Analogously, if $x_{i}=1$ then there exists a blue edge $(x+3 i-2) \\rightarrow(x+3 i)$; then the edge $(y+3 i-2) \\rightarrow(y+3 i)$ also should exist, so $y_{i}=1$.

#Elements Identified#:
- Quadratic functions: \(f_1(x) = p_1 x^2 + q_1 x + r_1\) and \(f_2(x) = p_2 x^2 + q_2 x + r_2\) with \(p_1 > 0 > p_2\), defined on the Cartesian plane.
- Points of intersection: Distinct points \(A\) and \(B\) where the graphs cross.
- Tangents: Four tangents to the graphs at \(A\) and \(B\) (two at each point).
- Quadrilateral: Formed by the four tangents, specified to be convex and have an inscribed circle.
- Theme: Focus on symmetry and properties of tangents leading to the conclusion that both functions share the same axis of symmetry.
- Key components to manipulate: Coefficients (\(p_1, q_1, r_1, p_2, q_2, r_2\)), intersection points (\(A\) and \(B\)), tangent properties, quadrilateral properties (e.g., convexity, inscribed circle), and the axis of symmetry.

Step 2
#Plan#:
- Transform from proof to computation: Replace the proof requirement with a computational task that demands finding a specific numerical answer. Retain the core elements (quadratics with \(p_1 > 0 > p_2\), intersection at A and B, tangents forming convex quadrilateral with inscribed circle), but assign fixed values to most coefficients to set up a concrete problem. Specifically, set \(p_1 = 4\), \(p_2 = -2\), \(r_1 = 1\), \(r_2 = 2\), and \(q_1 = 0\) to reduce variables and ensure a common axis (since \(q_1 = 0\) implies axis at \(x = 0\), and symmetry conditions will fix \(q_2\)). This leverages the original proof's implication that common symmetry is necessary for the circle to exist.
- Increase complexity by adding a specific output: Compute the radius of the inscribed circle. This requires deriving the quadrilateral, finding its side lengths or using geometric properties to calculate the radius, based on the specified coefficients. It introduces numerical computation with potentially messy arithmetic.
- Introduce additional dependencies: Incorporate that the inscribed circle must touch the x-axis at a specified point, say \((0, c)\), adding a constraint that integrate coordinate geometry and optimizes for tangency with the axes. This complicates the problem by requiring to solve for \(c\) and incorporate it into the calculation.
- Ensure interconnectedness: All modifications (fixed coefficients, common axis, circle touching x-axis) tie together logically. The tangential quadrilateral condition determines \(q_2\) implicitly via common symmetry, and the new constraint refines the circle's properties. Complexity is heightened through step-wise reasoning: confirm common axis, find intersections and tangents, form quadrilateral, use in circle condition, and solve for radius with the touch-point constraint.

- Condition: Each smaller quadrilateral has perpendicular diagonals.  
- Theme: Proof focusing on the concyclicity of P, Q, R, S under these conditions.

**Step 2**  
**#Plan#**:  
1. **Change quadrilateral to a specific instance**: Set ABCD as a parallelogram with non-equal sides defined by vertices A(0,0), B(4,0), C(5,3), D(1,3). This adds complexity by breaking symmetry and requiring detailed coordinate manipulation.  
2. **Pinpoint specific positions for two points**: Fix P and R as midpoints of AB and CD to reduce some variables but increase rigidity. Solve for unfixed Q (on BC) and S (on DA) under the perpendicular diagonals condition, yielding irrational coordinates involving radicals.  
3. **Replace proof with computational objective**: After finding Q and S, calculate the circumdiameter of PQRS (noting that concyclicity holds, making this unique) and demand the answer in reduced radical form. This shifts from abstract proof to exact numerical computation.  
*Justification*: The coordinate setup forces solving nonlinear equations for intersection points. Radicals and asymmetry ensure nontrivial arithmetic. Diameter computation combines geometry with algebra, increasing complexity over the original proof.

Let $P Q R S$ be a convex quadrangle whose diagonals meet at $O$. Let $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{2}$ be the circles on diameters $P Q$ and $R S$, respectively, and let $\\ell$ be their radical axis. Finally, choose the points $A, B$, and $C$ outside this quadrangle so that: the point $P$ (respectively, $Q$ ) lies on the segment $A B$ (respectively, $B C$ ); and $A O \\perp P S, B O \\perp P Q$, and $C O \\perp Q R$. Then the three lines $A C, P Q$, and $\\ell$ are concurrent or parallel.\n\n\n\nProof. Assume first that the lines $P R$ and $Q S$ are not perpendicular. Let $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ be the orthocentres of the triangles $O S P$ and $O Q R$, respectively; notice that $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ do not coincide.\n\n\n\nSince $H_{1}$ is the radical centre of the circles on diameters $R S, S P$, and $P Q$, it lies on $\\ell$. Similarly, $H_{2}$ lies on $\\ell$, so the lines $H_{1} H_{2}$ and $\\ell$ coincide.\n\n\n\nThe corresponding sides of the triangles $A P H_{1}$ and $C Q H_{2}$ meet at $O, B$, and the orthocentre of the triangle $O P Q$ (which lies on $O B$ ). By Desargues' theorem, the lines $A C, P Q$ and $\\ell$ are concurrent or parallel.\n\n\n\n<img_3558>\n\n\n\nThe case when $P R \\perp Q S$ may be considered as a limit case, since the configuration in the statement of the lemma allows arbitrarily small perturbations. The lemma is proved.\n\n\n\nBack to the problem, let the segments $P R$ and $Q S$ cross at $O$, let $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{2}$ be the circles on diameters $P Q$ and $R S$, respectively, and let $\\ell$ be their radical axis. By the Lemma, the three lines $A C, \\ell$, and $P Q$ are concurrent or parallel, and similarly so are the three lines $A C, \\ell$, and $R S$. Thus, if the lines $A C$ and $\\ell$ are distinct, all four lines are concurrent or pairwise parallel.\n\n\n\nThis is clearly the case when the lines $P S$ and $Q R$ are not parallel (since $\\ell$ crosses $O A$ and $O C$ at the orthocentres of $O S P$ and $O Q R$, these orthocentres being distinct from $A$ and $C$ ). In this case, denote the concurrency point by $T$. If $T$ is not ideal, then we have $T P \\cdot T Q=T R \\cdot T S$ (as $T \\in \\ell$ ), so $P Q R S$ is cyclic. If $T$ is ideal (i.e., all four lines are parallel), then the segments $P Q$ and $R S$ have the same perpendicular bisector (namely, the line of centers of $\\omega_{1}$ and $\\omega_{2}$ ), and $P Q R S$ is cyclic again.\n\n\n\nAssume now $P S$ and $Q R$ parallel. By symmetry, $P Q$ and $R S$ may also be assumed parallel: otherwise, the preceding argument goes through after relabelling. In this case, we need to prove that the parallelogram $P Q R S$ is a rectangle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<img_3452>\n\n\n\nSuppose, by way of contradiction, that $O P>O Q$. Let the line through $O$ and parallel to $P Q$ meet $A B$ at $M$, and $C B$ at $N$. Since $O P>O Q$, the angle $S P Q$ is acute and the angle $P Q R$ is obtuse, so the angle $A O B$ is obtuse, the angle $B O C$ is acute, $M$ lies on the segment $A B$, and $N$ lies on the extension of the segment $B C$ beyond $C$. Therefore: $O A>O M$, since the angle $O M A$ is obtuse; $O M>O N$, since $O M: O N=K P: K Q$, where $K$ is the projection of $O$ onto $P Q$; and $O N>O C$, since the angle $O C N$ is obtuse. Consequently, $O A>O C$.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, $O R>O S$ yields $O C>O A$ : a contradiction. Consequently, $O P=O Q$ and $P Q R S$ is a rectangle. This ends the proof.""

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Concretize Geometry:**
    *   Define $\ell$ as the $x$-axis.
    *   Fix $\Gamma$: Assign its center $O$ at $(0, -r)$ and radius $r$. This ensures tangency to $\ell$ ($x$-axis) at $(0,0)$.
    *   Fix $\Omega$: Assign its center $C$ at $(d, e)$ and radius $s$. Choose $d > 0$, $e > 0$, $e > s$, and $\Omega$ sufficiently far ($|\ OC| > |r \pm s|$) to guarantee it's disjoint from $\ell$, lies on the opposite side of $\ell$ relative to $\Gamma$, and does not intersect '$\Gamma$'.

    *   These values require handling irrational numbers, products of radicals like $\sqrt{6}$, and careful simplification of expressions involving squares and fractions.
4.  **Ensure Interconnectedness and Justification:**
    *   The computed expression $r_1^2 + r_2^2$ is derived from the invariant property and depends non-trivially on all the assigned geometric parameters ($d$, $e$, $r$, $s$). The specific values guarantee sufficient complexity without overstepping constraints (e.g., $|\ OC| = \sqrt{7^2 + (7\sqrt{3})^2} = \sqrt{49+147} = \sqrt{196} = 14 > |\sqrt{2} \pm \sqrt{3}| \approx |1.414 \pm 1.732|$ ensures disjointness).

#Plan#:
1. **Concretize Dimensions**: Specify numerical lengths for trapezoid bases and height to eliminate symmetry and require explicit calculation. Use AB = 12, CD = 18, height = 8. This forces computation of coordinates, circle equations, and tangents.
2. **Demand Computational Output**: Instead of proving PE is tangent to Ω (reliant on the given conclusion), modify it to compute a specific numerical value. The length of PE is chosen as it involves multi-step complex arithmetic.
3. **Incorporate Complex Math and Constraints**: Solve for circles ω and Ω using general equations; derive tangent equations via circle properties; intersect tangents at P; compute distance PE.

 'Recall that the girth of a graph $G$ is the minimal length of a (simple) cycle in this graph.\n\n\n\nLemma. For any fixed positive $\\delta$, a graph on $v$ vertices whose girth is at least $\\delta v$ has at most $v+o(v)$ edges.\n\n\n\nProof. Define $f(v)$ to be the maximal number $f$ such that a graph on $v$ vertices whose girth is at least $\\delta v$ may have $v+f$ edges. We are interested in the recursive estimates for $f$.\n\n\n\nLet $G$ be a graph on $v$ vertices whose gifth is at least $\\delta v$ containing $v+f(v)$ edges. If $G$ contains a leaf (i.e., a vertex of degree 1), then one may remove this vertex along with its edge, obtaining a graph with at most $v-1+f(v-1)$ edges. Thus, in this case $f(v) \\leq f(v-1)$.\n\n\n\nDefine an isolated path of length $k$ to be a sequence of vertices $v_{0}, v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{k}$, such that $v_{i}$ is connected to $v_{i+1}$, and each of the vertices $v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{k-1}$ has degree 2 (so, these vertices are connected only to their neighbors in the path). If $G$ contains an isolated path $v_{0}, \\ldots, v_{k}$ of length, say, $k>\\sqrt{v}$, then one may remove all its middle vertices $v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{k-1}$, along with all their $k$ edges. We obtain a graph on $v-k+1$ vertices with at most $(v-k+1)+f(v-k+1)$ edges. Thus, in this case $f(v) \\leq f(v-k+1)+1$.\n\n\n\nAssume now that the lengths of all isolated paths do not exceed $\\sqrt{v}$; we show that in this case $v$ is bounded from above. For that purpose, we replace each maximal isolated path by an edge between its endpoints, removing all middle vertices. We obtain a graph $H$ whose girth is at least $\\delta v / \\sqrt{v}=\\delta \\sqrt{v}$. Each vertex of $H$ has degree at least 3. By the girth condition, the neighborhood of any vertex $x$ of radius $r=\\lfloor(\\delta \\sqrt{v}-1) / 2\\rfloor$ is a tree rooted at $x$. Any vertex at level $i<r$ has at least two sons; so the tree contains at least $2^{\\lfloor(\\delta \\sqrt{v}-1) / 2\\rfloor}$ vertices (even at the last level). So, $v \\geq 2^{\\lfloor(\\delta \\sqrt{v}-1) / 2\\rfloor}$ which may happen only for a finite number of values of $v$.\n\n\n\nThus, for all large enough values of $v$, we have either $f(v) \\leq f(v-1)$ or $f(v) \\leq f(v-k+1)$ for some $k>\\sqrt{v}$. This easily yields $f(v)=o(v)$, as desired.\n\n\n\nNow we proceed to the problem. Consider a graph on $v$ vertices containing no two simple cycles of the same length. Take its $\\lfloor\\varepsilon v / 2\\rfloor$ shortest cycles (or all its cycles, if their total number is smaller) and remove an edge from each. We get a graph of girth at least $\\varepsilon v / 2$. By the lemma, the number of edges in the obtained graph is at most $v+o(v)$, so the number of edges in the initial graph is at most $v+\\varepsilon v / 2+o(v)$, which is smaller than $(1+\\varepsilon) v$ if $v$ is large enough.']"

#Elements Identified#:
- Variables: Polynomials \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) with real coefficients, non-constant.
- Condition: Equation \(P(x)^{10} + P(x)^9 = Q(x)^{21} + Q(x)^{20}\) is given.
- Theme: Existence of non-constant polynomial solutions for the equation.
- Structure: The original is a proof query focused on existence, which requires showing if such polynomials exist by leveraging properties of polynomials (factorization, degrees, coprimality).

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. Change the equation to ensure solutions exist and increase computational difficulty by introducing a specific parameter requiring numeric output. Replace the exponents \((10, 9, 21, 20)\) with \((10, 9, 6, 5)\) to form \(P(x)^{10} + P(x)^9 = Q(x)^6 + Q(x)^5\), as degree analysis shows minimal degrees exist, enabling computation.
2. Modify the task from existence to computation: Ask for the minimal possible degree of \(P\) for non-constant solutions, as it is derivable by degree balancing and requires calculating the integer \(d\) satisfying \(10d = 6e\) for some integer \(e\) (degree of \(Q\)).
3. Introduce a derivation step: The minimal degree comes from the equation \(10d = 6e\), implying \(5d = 3e\), so minimal \(d = 3\) when \(e = 5\). This forces computational use of degree comparison.
4. Add implicit complexity: The minimal degree (3) is non-trivial as it requires polynomial coefficient matching at degree 3 for \(P\), which involves solving a system of equations for existence, making it computationally intense (though not explicitly solved in the query, the degree is the complex output).
5. Ensure cohesion: The problem remains polynomial-focused with real coefficients, but shifts from abstraction (existence) to concrete computation of minimal degree.

An up-right corner (or UR-corner) is defined similarly. The common endpoint of two unit grid-segments at a corner is the joint of that corner.\n\nFix a vertical line on the grid and call it the midline; the unit grid-segments along the midline are called middle segments. The unit grid-segments lying to the left/right of the midline are called left/right segments.

Assume that at some stage, Bob orients some segment $s$. If $s$ is a middle segment, Ann orients any free middle segment arbitrarily. Otherwise, $s$ forms a corner in the partition with some other segment $t$. Then Ann orients $t$ so that the joint of the corner is either the source of both arrows, or the target of both. Notice that after any move of Ann's, each corner in the partition is either completely oriented or completely not oriented. This means that Ann can always make a required move.\n\nAssume that Bob wins at some stage, i.e., an oriented cycle $C$ occurs. Let $X$ be the lowest of the leftmost points of $C$, and let $Y$ be the topmost of the rightmost points of $C$.

#Elements Identified#:
*   **Core Concept:** Boundedness (or growth rate) of a sequence $\{a(n)\}$ satisfying a ""pseudo-subadditivity"" condition ($a(m+n) \leq 2a(m) + 2a(n)$) and exponential decay on powers of 2 ($a(2^k) \leq \frac{1}{(k+1)^c}$ for $c>2$).
*   **Variables:** $c$ (constant $>2$), $\{a(n)\}$ (nonnegative real sequence).
*   **Conditions:** (1) Subadditivity-like inequality, (2) Power-of-2 bound.
*   **Action/Process:** The proof relies on expressing any $n$ via its binary expansion and recursively applying the pseudo-subadditivity condition to relate $a(n)$ to the bounding values at powers of 2.
*   **Theme:** Controlling the growth of sequences with constrained additive behavior and known values on a sparse subsequence.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Replace Boundedness Proof with Quantitative Limit Calculation:** Instead of proving boundedness, which indicates $\limsup_{n \to \infty} a(n) < \infty$, require the *computation* of this limsup.
2.  **Introduce Periodicity Constraint:** Replace the simple pseudo-subadditivity condition with a periodic constraint that varies in *strength*, complicating how values at different indices relate while still allowing derivation of a bound. This creates dependencies across residues.
3.  **Add a Summation Target:** Introduce a specific computational target requiring summation over a set (primes) to generate a non-trivial value ($S_q(N)$). This necessitates computing numerous $a(p)$ values and aggregates them.
4.  **Set a Specific Challenge:** Provide a fixed $c$ (e.g., $c=3$) and a large $N$ (e.g., $N=1000$) for the sum, ensuring actual computation is involved. The modulo class ($q=4$) prevents symmetry exploitation.
5.  **Maintain Logical Consistency:** Ensure the new conditions still allow a limsup to exist (guaranteed by the power-of-2 decay), justify the $q$-dependent constant $D_q$ as a necessary target for the limsup expression, and connect the multiplicative and additive structures meaningfully within periodic classes.
