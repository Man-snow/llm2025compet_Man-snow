#Elements Identified#:
- Participants: Two convex quadrilateral regions \(P\) and \(P'\).
- Conditions: They intersect at a point \(O\), and for every line \(\ell\) through \(O\), the segment \(\ell \cap P\) is strictly longer than \(\ell \cap P^{\prime}\).
- Theme: Geometric properties of convex polygons, specifically the relationship between chord lengths through a common point and area ratios.
- Type: Proof problem (asks ""Is it possible?"" with a yes/no expected).

Step 2
#Plan#:
1. Generalize the shapes from quadrilaterals to convex polygons with \(n\) sides to increase complexity and add variability.
2. Introduce a parameter \(r > 1\) for the minimum ratio of segment lengths, replacing the strict inequality with \(\text{len}(\ell \cap P) / \text{len}(\ell \cap P^{\prime}) \geq r\), to allow for quantitative analysis and dependencies.
3. Change the question from a possibility proof to a computational problem by asking for the supremum of \(\text{area}(P^{\prime}) / \text{area}(P)\) in terms of \(n\) and \(r\), which requires finding a specific numerical value for fixed parameters.
4. Fix \(n = 4\) and \(r = 1.1\) to ground the computation, ensuring the problem remains concrete but is harder due to the need for precise bounds or optimization.
5. Maintain logical coherence by ensuring all mods are interconnected—polygon generality, length ratio constraint, and area ratio supremum rely on each other to define feasible configurations.

- Type: Proof problem.
- Core concept: Proving every prime number occurs in a recursively defined integer sequence characterized by a minimality condition involving k-th roots and floor functions.

#Plan#:
- Transform the proof problem into a difficult computational problem by focusing on finding a specific value rather than universal proof, ensuring it is hard due to recursive buildup and minimality conditions.
- Retain the original recurrence structure but fix $k=2$ to simplify the parameter while maintaining inherent complexity from flooring and k-th roots.
- Instead of proving all primes appear, compute the index of a specific large prime (i.e., the 50th prime, 229) to increase complexity via heavy computation: building the entire sequence step-by-step until the term 229 is encountered, requiring access to all prior terms and numerous evaluations. This is harder than the original proof since it demands constructive validation, handles many steps, and verifies minimality at each term.

We produce it as a composition of three other projections. Let $O$ be the intersection of lines $A D^{\\prime} D Y$ and $C I N$. Projecting the points $Y N C M$ on the circle $A B C$ through the (concyclic) point $A$ to the line $C N$ yields the points $O N C I$.

#Elements Identified#:  
- Triangle \(ABC\) with incenter \(I\).  
- Circle passing through point \(B\) and tangent to line \(AI\) at \(I\), intersecting \(AB\) again at \(P\).  
- Circle passing through point \(C\) and tangent to line \(AI\) at \(I\), intersecting \(AC\) again at \(Q\).  
- The original conclusion is that \(PQ\) is tangent to the incircle of \(ABC\).  
- Theme: Properties of incenter and circles with tangency constraints.  
- Type: Proof problem.  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
- Transform the proof into a computational problem for a specific non-isosceles triangle, requiring the calculation of a specific numerical length.  
- Increase complexity by specifying a non-trivial scalene triangle with integer side lengths \(AB = 13\), \(BC = 14\), \(AC = 15\).  
- Instead of proving tangency (as it holds generally), require the computation of the length \(PQ\) to add computational difficulty.  
- Maintain the core structure and properties (incenter, circles tangent to \(AI\) at \(I\) passing through \(B\) or \(C\), and intersections \(P\) and \(Q\)) while imposing precise side lengths that necessitate extensive coordinate geometry, radical handling, and fraction calculations.  
- Ensure complexity remains high without introducing extraneous variables or conditions beyond the triangle's dimensions.

 'Like before, notice that $A Q \\cdot A C=A P \\cdot A B=A I^{2}$. Consider the positive inversion $\\Psi$ with center $A$ and power $A I^{2}$. This maps $P$ to $B$ (and vice-versa), $Q$ to $C$ (and vice-versa), and keeps the incenter $I$ fixed. The problem statement will follow from the fact that the image of the incircle of triangle $A B C$ under $\\Psi$ is the so-called mixtilinear incircle of $A B C$, which is defined to be the circle tangent to the lines $A B, A C$, and the circumcircle of $A B C$. Indeed, since the image of the line $Q P$ is the circumcircle of $A B C$, and inversion preserves tangencies, this implies that $Q P$ is tangent to the incircle of $A B C$.\n\nWe justify the claim as follows: let $\\gamma$ be the incircle of $A B C$ and let $\\Gamma_{A}$ be the $A$-mixtilinear incircle of $A B C$.

#Elements Identified#:  
- Variables: Integer \(n \geq 2\), sequence of positive integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\), and constructed sequence \(b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n\).  
- Conditions for \(b_i\): \(a_i \leq b_i\) (lower bound), remainders modulo \(n\) pairwise distinct (residue constraint), and an upper bound on the sum \(\sum b_i\) involving \(\left\lfloor \frac{\sum a_i}{n} \right\rfloor\).  
- Theme: Ensuring existence of \(b_i\) with specific constraints related to modular arithmetic and sum minimization.  
- Type: Proof problem (requires existence demonstration).  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
- Replace the existential proof with a computational problem, demanding a specific minimal sum under non-trivial sequences and fixed parameters.  
  - Set \(n = 12\) (larger fixed value to force non-trivial computation).  
  - Specify \(a_i = i^2\) for \(1 \leq i \leq n\) (quadratic growth introduces varying residuals and increases complexity in residue assignment).  
  - Ask for the minimal possible sum \(\sum_{i=1}^n b_i\) satisfying the conditions (requires exact optimization rather than existence proof).  
- Retain all original conditions but impose \(a_i\) explicitly and fix \(n\), ensuring dependency between variables and real-world-like constraints.  
- Ensure computation is challenging: For \(n=12\) and quadratic \(a_i\), residue assignments affect sum minimization, requiring cost matrix optimization.

On a circle, Alina draws \(k\) chords in general position, the endpoints of which are all different. A point is marked if it is either (i) one of the \(2k\) endpoints, labeled with \(k\) 0s and \(k\) 1s, or (ii) an intersection point of chords, labeled with some integer from \(\{-1, 0, 1\}\). Along each chord, segments between consecutive marked points are labeled yellow with the sum and blue with the absolute difference of their endpoints. The \(k^2\) yellow labels take each value in \(\{0, 1, \dots, k^2 - 1\}\) exactly once. Compute the minimum number of segments where the blue label is divisible by 3.","### Step 1  
**#Elements Identified#:**  
- Variables: Number of chords (2019), endpoints (4038 with 2019 labeled 0 and 2019 labeled 1), intersection points labeled with arbitrary integers, segments per chord (based on marked points), yellow labels (sum of endpoints of segment), blue labels (absolute difference of endpoints).  
- Conditions: Marked points include endpoints and intersections; segments connect consecutive marked points; yellow labels must cover all integers from 0 to N exactly once; N+1 is the total number of segments.  
- Theme: Combinatorial geometry with modular arithmetic properties (focus on multiples of 3 via blue labels).  
- Participants: Alina (but not essential).  
- Actions: Drawing chords, labeling points, computing segment labels.  
- Type: Proof problem (it asks to ""show"" a conclusion).  

### Step 2  
**#Plan#:**  
1. **Make the number of chords variable:** Replace the fixed 2019 chords with a variable integer \(k \geq 3\) (since \(k=1,2\) are trivial/invalid as per the structure).  
2. **Introduce constraints on intersection point labels:** Instead of arbitrary integers, require labels to be from the set \(\{-1, 0, 1\}\) to restrict possibilities and increase computational difficulty in achieving the yellow label condition and handling modular arithmetic.  
3. **Alter the conclusion to a computational goal:** Instead of proving that at least one blue label is divisible by 3, demand the precise computation of the minimum number of blue labels that must be divisible by 3 over all valid configurations. This requires enumerating or deriving a formula based on the variable \(k\) and constraints.  
4. **Increase reasoning complexity:** Add that all chords must be in general position (no two parallel, no three concurrent) to standardize the number of segments and intersections, but ensure the restricted label set makes the yellow label condition (\(\{0, 1, \dots, k^2 - 1\}\)) feasible yet harder to satisfy, forcing intricate balance in label assignments.  
5. **Ensure coherence:** The variable \(k\), restricted labels, and computational output are linked: the minimum number of blue-multiple-of-3 segments depends on the tension between avoiding modulo 3 matchups (via labels in \(\{-1,0,1\}\)) and the requirement for consecutive sums (yellow labels). The general position fixes segment counts (total segments \(S = k^2\), so \(N = k^2 - 1\)).

### Step 3

Along each chord, segments between consecutive marked points are labeled yellow with the sum and blue with the absolute difference of their endpoints. Given that the \(k^2\) yellow labels take each value in \(\{0, 1, \dots, k^2 - 1\}\) exactly once, compute the minimum number of segments where the blue label is divisible by 3.

But then $E_{W B}=C_{W}$ so certainly the parities are equal.\n\nNow returning to the original problem, assume that no two adjacent vertex labels differ by a multiple of three, and three-colour the vertices according to the residue class of the labels modulo 3. Let $E_{01}$ denote the number of edges between 0 -vertices and 1-vertices, and $C_{0}$ denote the number of 0 -vertices on the boundary, and so on.\n\nThen, consider the two-coloring obtained by combining the 1-vertices and 2-vertices.

So the connected component $\\mathcal{C}$ containing these leaves has an Eulerian path, and any other component has an Eulerian cycle.\n\nLet $E_{01}^{*}$ denote the number of edges between 0 -vertices and 1-vertices in $\\mathcal{C}$, and let $E_{01}^{\\prime}$ denote the number of such edges in the other components, and so on. By studying whether a given vertex has label congruent to 0 modulo 3 or not as we go along the Eulerian path in $\\mathcal{C}$, we find $E_{01}^{*}+E_{02}^{*}$ is odd, and similarly $E_{01}^{*}+E_{12}^{*}$ is odd. Since neither start nor end vertex is a 2 -vertex, $E_{02}^{*}+E_{12}^{*}$ must be even.\n\nApplying the same argument for the Eulerian cycle in each other component and adding up, we find that $E_{01}^{\\prime}+E_{02}^{\\prime}, E_{01}^{\\prime}+E_{12}^{\\prime}, E_{02}^{\\prime}+E_{12}^{\\prime}$ are all even.

3. Replace the final proof goal with a computational goal: given specific side lengths of △ABC, extension ratios k and m, and the condition AD = BE, compute the measure of angle C in degrees.  
4. Choose specific BC = 7 and AC = 5 to ensure non-trivial calculation and avoid simple cases.  
5. Set k = 2 for CD and m = 3 for AE, ensuring the conditions lead to a valid angle C.

- Objective: Prove \(\angle ACP = \angle QCB\).  
- Type: Proof problem (requires transformation to computational problem).  
- Key elements: Triangle angles/sides, circle tangency, point \(P\), parallel line, angle equality.  
- Adjustable components: Make triangle specific (set side lengths and angles), set numerical constraints, request exact angle/side ratio, incorporate coordinate geometry.  

**Step 2**  
**#Plan#**:

 'If a dwarf $X$ performs the same type of work on three days $D_{1}, D_{2}, D_{3}$, then we say that this triple of days is monotonous for $X$.

Then among the remaining dwarves there exist three dwarves $Y_{1}, Y_{2}, Y_{3}$ that performed both types of work on day $D_{1}$ and on day $D_{2}$; without loss of generality these three dwarves worked in the mine on day $D_{1}$ and collected berries on day $D_{2}$. On day $D_{3}$, two of $Y_{1}, Y_{2}, Y_{3}$ performed the same type of work, and without loss of generality $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{2}$ worked in the mine. But then on days $D_{1}$ and $D_{3}$, each of the five dwarves $X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}, Y_{1}, Y_{2}$ performed only one type of work; this is in contradiction with the problem statement.)\n\nNext we consider some fixed triple $X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}$ of dwarves. There are eight possible working schedules for $X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}$ (like mine-mine-mine, mine-mine-berries, mine-berriesmine, etc). As the above forbidden configuration does not occur, each of these eight working schedules must occur on exactly two of the sixteen days. In particular this implies that every dwarf worked exactly eight times in the mine and exactly eight times in the forest.\n\nFor $0 \\leqslant k \\leqslant 7$ we denote by $d(k)$ the number of days on which exactly $k$ dwarves were collecting berries. Since on the first day all seven dwarves were in the mine, on each of the remaining days at least three dwarves collected berries. This yields $d(0)=1$ and $d(1)=d(2)=0$. We assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $d(7)=0$ and hence\n\n$$\nd(3)+d(4)+d(5)+d(6)=15 \\tag{1}\n$$\n\nAs every dwarf collected berries exactly eight times, we get that, further,\n\n$$\n3 d(3)+4 d(4)+5 d(5)+6 d(6)=7 \\cdot 8=56 .\n\\tag{2}\n$$\n\nNext, let us count the number $q$ of quadruples $\\left(X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}, D\\right)$ for which $X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3}$ are three pairwise distinct dwarves that all collected berries on day $D$.

Moreover, Fact 1.1 says that the sequences are (weakly) decreasing and hence eventually constant. In other words, the sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, d_{3}, \\ldots$ is 2 -periodic modulo $s^{2}-1$ (from the start) and is eventually 2-periodic.\n\nNow, assume that some term in the sequence is equal to 1 .

Hence, the sequence $e_{1}, e_{2}, \\ldots$ also contains a 1 .\n\nSince the conclusion we are trying to reach only depends on the residue of $d_{1}$ modulo $s^{2}-1$, we conclude that without loss of generality we can assume $n<s^{2}$.\n\nFact 2.2. If $k \\leq s^{2}-1$, then $k^{\\prime} \\leq s^{2}-1$ and $k^{\\prime \\prime}=k$.\n\n\nProof. Write $k=a s+b$, as in the problem statement. If $k<s^{2}$, then it must hold $1 \\leq a, b<s$, hence $k^{\\prime}=b s+a<s^{2}$ and $k^{\\prime \\prime}=(b s+a)^{\\prime}=a s+b=k$.\n\nUsing Fact 2.2, it now follows that the sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots$ is periodic with period two.

Hence, $d_{1} \\equiv 1, s\\left(\\bmod s^{2}-1\\right)$ as desired.\n\nFor the other direction we can make a similar argument, observing that the second of the two cases in the proof of Fact 3.1 can only apply to finitely many terms of the sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, d_{3}, \\ldots$, allowing us to also go the other way.'
 'First assume that $d_{k}=1$ for some $k$. Let $k$ be the smallest such index.

So, if $k=2$, then $n=s$, so we may assume $k \\geqslant 3$.\n\nThen there exist non-negative integers $c, d$ satisfying $d_{k-2}=c s+d, d<s$ and $d s+c=s$. We have two solutions: $d=0, c=s$ and $d=1, c=0$. However, in the second case we get $d_{k-2}=1$, which contradicts the minimality of $k$. Hence, $d_{k-2}=s^{2}$.

It follows that the remainder when $n=d_{1}$ is divided by $s^{2}-1$ is either 1 or $s$.\n\n\n\nTo prove the other implication, assume that $n$ gives remainder 1 or $s$ when divided by $s^{2}-1$. If $n \\in\\left\\{1, s, s^{2}\\right\\}$, then one of the numbers $d_{1}, d_{2}$ and $d_{3}$ is 1 . We therefore assume that $n>s^{2}$. Since the reminder when a power of $s$ is divided by $s^{2}-1$ is either 1 or $s$, there exists a positive integer $m$ such that $s^{m}-n$ is non-negative and divisible by $s^{2}-1$. By our assumption $m \\geqslant 3$. We also take the smallest such $m$, so that $n>s^{m-2}$.

Let $m$ be the minimum of all of the entries in the array.\n\nChoose an entry in the array equal to $m$, say $A_{r}=m$ for some integer $r$. The same argument can be applied with $B_{r}=m$ if there are no entries equal to $m$ in the top row.\n\nIf not all of the entries $A_{j}$ are equal to $m$, then by moving one direction or the other along the row we will get to some point where $A_{t}=m$ for some integer $t$ but one of its neighbours is not equal to $m$. (If this were not to happen, then all of the entries in both directions would be equal to $m$.)\n\nIf all of the entries $A_{j}$ are equal to $m$, then since not all of the entries in the array are equal to $m$, then there will be an entry $B_{t}$ which is not equal to $m$.\n\nIn other words, since not all of the entries in the array are equal, then there exists an integer $t$ for which $A_{t}=m$ and not all of $A_{t-1}, A_{t+1}, B_{t}$ are equal to $m$.\n\nBut $3 m=3 A_{t}$ and $3 A_{t}=A_{t-1}+B_{t}+A_{t+1}$ so $3 m=A_{t-1}+B_{t}+A_{t+1}$.\n\nSince not all of $A_{t-1}, B_{t}$ and $A_{t+1}$ are equal to $m$ and each is at least $m$, then one of these entries will be greater than $m$.\n\nThis means that $A_{t-1}+B_{t}+A_{t+1} \\geq m+m+(m+1)=3 m+1>3 m$, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore our assumption that not all of the entries are equal must be false, which means that all of the entries are equal, which proves statement $(\\mathrm{P})$.\n\nProof of statement (Q)\n\nSuppose that all of the entries are positive real numbers.\n\nAssume that not all of the entries in the array are equal.\n\nAs in (b), define $S_{k}=A_{k}+B_{k}$ for each integer $k$.\n\nAlso, define $D_{k}=A_{k}-B_{k}$ for each integer $k$.\n\nStep 1: Prove that the numbers $S_{k}$ form an arithmetic sequence\n\nFrom (b), $S_{k+1}=2 S_{k}-S_{k-1}$.\n\nRe-arranging, we see $S_{k+1}-S_{k}=S_{k}-S_{k-1}$ for each integer $k$, which means that the differences between consecutive pairs of terms are equal.\n\nSince this is true for all integers $k$, then the difference between each pair of consecutive\n\n\n\nterms through the whole sequence is constant, which means that the sequence is an arithmetic sequence.\n\nStep 2: Prove that $S_{k}$ is constant\n\nSuppose that $S_{0}=c$. Since $A_{0}>0$ and $B_{0}>0$, then $S_{0}=c>0$.\n\nSince the terms $S_{k}$ form an arithmetic sequence, then the sequence is either constant, increasing or decreasing.\n\nIf the sequence of terms $S_{k}$ is increasing, then the common difference $d=S_{1}-S_{0}$ is positive.\n\nNote that $S_{-1}=c-d, S_{-2}=c-2 d$, and so on.\n\nSince $c$ and $d$ are constant, then if we move far enough back along the sequence, eventually $S_{t}$ will be negative for some integer $t$. This is a contradiction since $A_{t}>0$ and $B_{t}>0$ and $S_{t}=A_{t}+B_{t}$.\n\nThus, the sequence cannot be increasing.\n\nIf the sequence of terms $S_{k}$ is decreasing, then the common difference $d=S_{1}-S_{0}$ is negative.\n\nNote that $S_{1}=c+d, S_{2}=c+2 d$, and so on.\n\nSince $c$ and $d$ are constant, then if we move far along the sequence, eventually $S_{t}$ will be negative for some integer $t$. This is also a contradiction since $A_{t}>0$ and $B_{t}>0$ and $S_{t}=A_{t}+B_{t}$.\n\nThus, the sequence cannot be decreasing.\n\nTherefore, since all of the entries are positive and the sequence $S_{k}$ is arithmetic, then $S_{k}$ is constant, say $S_{k}=c>0$ for all integers $k$.\n\nStep 3: Determine range of possible values for $D_{k}$\n\nWe note that $S_{k}=A_{k}+B_{k}=c$ for all integers $k$ and $A_{k}>0$ and $B_{k}>0$.\n\nSince $A_{k}>0$, then $B_{k}=S_{k}-A_{k}=c-A_{k}<c$.\n\nSimilarly, $A_{k}<c$.\n\nTherefore, $0<A_{k}<c$ and $0<B_{k}<c$.\n\nSince $D_{k}=A_{k}-B_{k}$, then $D_{k}<c-0=c$ and $D_{k}>0-c=-c$.\n\nIn other words, $-c<D_{k}<c$.\n\nStep 4: $D_{k+1}=4 D_{k}-D_{k-1}$\n\nUsing a similar approach in our proof of lemma (b)\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n3 D_{k} & =3 A_{k}-3 B_{k} \\\\\n3 D_{k} & =\\left(A_{k-1}+B_{k}+A_{k+1}\\right)-\\left(B_{k-1}+A_{k}+B_{k+1}\\right) \\\\\n3 D_{k} & =\\left(A_{k+1}-B_{k+1}\\right)+\\left(A_{k-1}-B_{k-1}\\right)-\\left(A_{k}-B_{k}\\right) \\\\\n3 D_{k} & =D_{k+1}+D_{k-1}-D_{k} \\\\\n4 D_{k}-D_{k-1} & =D_{k+1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nas required.\n\nStep 5: Final contradiction \n\n$\\text { We want to show that } D_{k}=0$ for all integers $k$.\n\nThis will show that $A_{k}=B_{k}$ for all integers $k$.\n\nSince $S_{k}=A_{k}+B_{k}=c$ for all integers $k$, then this would show that $A_{k}=B_{k}=\\frac{1}{2} c$ for all integers $k$, meaning that all entries in the array are equal.\n\nSuppose that $D_{k} \\neq 0$ for some integer $k$.\n\nWe may assume that $D_{0} \\neq 0$. (If $D_{0}=0$, then because the array is infinite in both directions, we can shift the numbering of the array so that a column where $D_{k} \\neq 0$ is\n\n\n\nlabelled column 0.)\n\nThus, $D_{0}>0$ or $D_{0}<0$.\n\nWe may assume that $D_{0}>0$. (If $D_{0}<0$, then we can switch the bottom and top rows of the array so that $D_{0}$ becomes positive.)\n\nSuppose that $D_{1} \\geq D_{0}>0$.\n\nThen $D_{2}=4 D_{1}-D_{0} \\geq 4 D_{1}-D_{1}=3 D_{1}$. Since $D_{1}>0$, this also means that $D_{2}>D_{1}>0$.\n\nSimilarly, $D_{3}=4 D_{2}-D_{1} \\geq 4 D_{2}-D_{2}=3 D_{2}>D_{2}>0$. Since $D_{2} \\geq 3 D_{1}$, then $D_{3} \\geq 9 D_{1}$. Continuing in this way, we see that $D_{4} \\geq 27 D_{1}$ and $D_{5} \\geq 81 D_{1}$ and so on, with $D_{k} \\geq 3^{k-1} D_{1}$ for each positive integer $k \\geq 2$. Since the value of $D_{1}$ is a fixed positive real number and $D_{k}<c$ for all integers $k$, this is a contradiction, because the sequence of values $3^{k-1}$ grows without bound.\n\nThe other possibility is that $D_{1}<D_{0}$.\n\nHere, we re-arrange $D_{k+1}=4 D_{k}-D_{k-1}$ to obtain $D_{k-1}=4 D_{k}-D_{k+1}$.\n\nThus, $D_{-1}=4 D_{0}-D_{1}>4 D_{0}-D_{0}=3 D_{0}>D_{0}>0$.\n\nExtending this using a similar method, we see that $D_{-j}>3^{j} D_{0}$ for all positive integers $j$ which will lead to the same contradiction as above.\n\nTherefore, a contradiction is obtained in all cases and so it cannot be the case that $D_{k} \\neq 0$ for some integer $k$.\n\nSince $D_{k}=0$ and $S_{k}=c$ for all integers $k$, then $A_{k}=B_{k}=\\frac{1}{2} c$ for all integers $k$, which means that all entries in the array are equal.']"

Each town resident belongs to exactly one group. Every week, each resident is required to make one dish and to bring it to his/her group.

It so happens that each resident knows how to make precisely two dishes. Moreover, no two residents of a town know how to make the same pair of dishes. Shown below are two example towns. In the left column are the names of the town's residents. Adjacent to each name is the list of dishes that the corresponding resident knows how to make.

The population of a town $T$, denoted $\operatorname{pop}(T)$, is the number of residents of $T$. Formally, the town itself is simply the set of its residents, denoted by $\left\{r_{1}, \ldots, r_{\mathrm{pop}(T)}\right\}$ unless otherwise specified. The set of dishes that the residents of $T$ collectively know how to make is denoted $\operatorname{dish}(T)$. For example, in the town of ARMLton described above, pop(ARMLton) $=3$, and dish(ARMLton) $=$ \{pie, turkey, salad, broth\}.

A town $T$ is called full if for every pair of dishes in $\operatorname{dish}(T)$, there is exactly one resident in $T$ who knows how to make those two dishes. In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.

Denote by $\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\left|\operatorname{dish}\left(\mathcal{F}_{d}\right)\right|=d$.

In order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \rightarrow\{1,2, \ldots, k\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\left(r_{i}\right)=f\left(r_{j}\right)$ for $i \neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.

For example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.


For a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\operatorname{chef}_{\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\{$ Sally, David $\}$.


If $\operatorname{gr}(T)=\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$ for some $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\operatorname{gr}(T)>\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$ for each dish $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.


A resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \leq i \leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \leq i, j \leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.
Let $T$ be a town such that, for each $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T),\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|=2$.

Prove that there are finitely many resident cycles $C_{1}, C_{2}, \ldots, C_{j}$ in $T$ so that each resident belongs to exactly one of the $C_{i}$.",,❌ Possible credit exhaustion or rate limit (429): Rate limit exceeded: free-models-per-min. ,failure,0.87,"['First note that the condition $\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|=2$ for all $D$ implies that $\\operatorname{pop}(T)=|\\operatorname{dish}(T)|$, using the equation from problem 5 . So for the town in question, the population of the town equals the number of dishes in the town. Because no two chefs cook the same pair of dishes, it is impossible for such a town to have exactly two residents, and because each dish is cooked by exactly two chefs, it is impossible for such a town to have only one resident.\n\nThe claim is true for towns of three residents satisfying the conditions: such towns must have one resident who cooks dishes $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$, one resident who cooks dishes $d_{2}$ and $d_{3}$, and one resident who cooks dishes $d_{3}$ and $d_{1}$, and those three residents form a cycle. So proceed by (modified) strong induction: assume that for some $n>3$ and for all positive integers $k$ such that $3 \\leq k<n$, every town $T$ with $k$ residents and $\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|=2$ for all $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$ can be divided into a finite number of resident cycles such that each resident belongs to exactly one of the cycles. Let $T_{n}$ be a town of $n$ residents, and arbitrarily pick resident $r_{1}$ and dishes $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$ cooked by $r_{1}$. Then there is exactly one other resident $r_{2}$ who also cooks $d_{2}$ (because $\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T_{n}}\\left(d_{2}\\right)\\right|=2$ ). But $r_{2}$ also cooks another dish, $d_{3}$, which is cooked by another resident, $r_{3}$. Continuing in this fashion, there can be only two outcomes: either the process exhausts all the residents of $T_{n}$, or there exists some resident $r_{m}, m<n$, who cooks the same dishes as $r_{m-1}$ and $r_{\\ell}$ for $\\ell<m-1$.\n\nIn the former case, $r_{n}$ cooks another dish; but every dish besides $d_{1}$ is already cooked by two chefs in $T_{n}$, so $r_{n}$ must also cook $d_{1}$, closing the cycle. Because every resident is in this cycle, the statement to be proven is also true for $T_{n}$.\n\nIn the latter case, the same logic shows that $r_{m}$ cooks $d_{1}$, also closing the cycle, but there are other residents of $T_{n}$ who have yet to be accounted for. Let $C_{1}=\\left\\{r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{m}\\right\\}$, and consider the town $T^{\\prime}$ whose residents are $T_{n} \\backslash C_{1}$. Each of dishes $d_{1}, \\ldots, d_{m}$ is cooked by two people in $C_{1}$, so no chef in $T^{\\prime}$ cooks any of these dishes, and no dish in $T^{\\prime}$ is cooked by any of the people in $C_{1}$ (because each person in $C_{1}$ already cooks two dishes in the set $\\operatorname{dish}\\left(C_{1}\\right)$ ). Thus $\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T^{\\prime}}(D)\\right|=2$ for each $D$ in $\\operatorname{dish}\\left(T^{\\prime}\\right)$. It follows that $\\operatorname{pop}\\left(T^{\\prime}\\right)<\\operatorname{pop}(T)$ but $\\operatorname{pop}\\left(T^{\\prime}\\right)>0$, so by the inductive hypothesis, the residents of $T^{\\prime}$ can be divided into disjoint resident cycles.\n\nThus the statement is proved by strong induction.']"

In the examples above, ARMLville is a full town, but ARMLton is not, because (for example) nobody in ARMLton knows how to make both turkey and salad.

Denote by $\mathcal{F}_{d}$ a full town in which collectively the residents know how to make $d$ dishes. That is, $\left|\operatorname{dish}\left(\mathcal{F}_{d}\right)\right|=d$.

In order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \rightarrow\{1,2, \ldots, k\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\left(r_{i}\right)=f\left(r_{j}\right)$ for $i \neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.

For example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.


For a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\operatorname{chef}_{\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\{$ Sally, David $\}$.


If $\operatorname{gr}(T)=\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$ for some $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\operatorname{gr}(T)>\left|\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\right|$ for each dish $D \in \operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.


A resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \leq i \leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \leq i, j \leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.
