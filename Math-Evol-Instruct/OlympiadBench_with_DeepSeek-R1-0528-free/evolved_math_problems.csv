Next, since $b / a_{i}$ is not the $k$ th power of an integer, we have $f_{n+1}(b)=f_{n+1}(b-1)+1=0$, thus $b=a_{n+1}$.

Enumerate all the tokens in the initial arrangement in clockwise circular order; also enumerate the vertices of the $2 n$-gon accordingly. Consider any three tokens $i<j<k$. At each moment, their cyclic order may be either $i, j, k$ or $i, k, j$, counted clockwise. This order changes exactly when two of these three tokens have been switched. Hence the order has been reversed thrice, and in the final arrangement token $k$ stands on the arc passing clockwise from token $i$ to token $j$. Thus, at the end, token $i+1$ is a counter-clockwise neighbor of token $i$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, 2 n-1$, so the tokens in the final arrangement are numbered successively in counter-clockwise circular order.\n\n\n\nThis means that the final arrangement of tokens can be obtained from the initial one by reflection in some line $\\ell$.\n\n\n\nStep 2. Notice that each token was involved into $2 n-1$ switchings, so its initial and final vertices have different parity. Hence $\\ell$ passes through the midpoints of two opposite sides of a $2 n$-gon; we may assume that these are the sides $a$ and $b$ connecting $2 n$ with 1 and $n$ with $n+1$, respectively.\n\n\n\nDuring the process, each token $x$ has crossed $\\ell$ at least once; thus one of its switchings has been made at edge $a$ or at edge $b$. Assume that some two its switchings were performed at $a$ and at $b$; we may (and will) assume that the one at $a$ was earlier, and $x \\leq n$. Then the total movement of token $x$ consisted at least of: (i) moving from vertex $x$ to $a$ and crossing $\\ell$ along $a$; (ii) moving from $a$ to $b$ and crossing $\\ell$ along $b$; (iii) coming to vertex $2 n+1-x$. This tales at least $x+n+(n-x)=2 n$ switchings, which is impossible.\n\n\n\nThus, each token had a switching at exactly one of the edges $a$ and $b$.\n\n\n\nStep 3. Finally, let us show that either each token has been switched at $a$, or each token has been switched at $b$ (then the other edge has never been used, as desired). To the contrary, assume that there were switchings at both $a$ and at $b$. Consider the first such switchings, and let $x$ and $y$ be the tokens which were moved clockwise during these switchings and crossed $\\ell$ at $a$ and $b$, respectively. By Step 2, $x \\neq y$.

Then this switching has been made after token $x$ had traced $a$. From this point on, token $x$ is on the clockwise arc from token $y$ to $b$, and it has no way to leave out from this arc.
