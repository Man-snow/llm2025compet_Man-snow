A student-entrepreneur bought several packs of masks from a pharmacy and sold them to classmates at a higher price, making a profit of 1000 rubles. With all the money earned, he bought more masks from the pharmacy (at the same price as the first purchase) and sold them to classmates (at the same price as the first sale).

#Elements Identified#:
*   Variables: Initial money spent (implicit: cost price per pack `c`, maybe quantity `q`), selling price per pack `s`, profits (1000 and 1500 rubles).
*   Actions: Buying masks (at cost `c`), selling masks (at price `s`), reinvesting total revenue.
*   Conditions & Structure: Same buy/sell prices in both cycles. Profit = Total sale revenue - Total purchase cost. Second cycle purchase uses the full revenue from the first cycle. Final target: initial purchase cost (`c * q`).
*   Theme: Simple linear reinvestment with basic profit calculation. Solves easily using two equations linking profit, cost, revenue.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Increase Variable/Equation Complexity:** Replace the single constant fee transaction model. Introduce a bulk discount `d%` on the *purchase* side. Mask prices are sold at a fixed price `s`.
2.  **Introduce Constraint:** Introduce a fixed transaction fee `f` rubles per pack sold (e.g., packaging/labeling cost).
3.  **Concretize:** Explicitly define ""money spent on the first purchase"" as `x` rubles instead of implying it via `c` and `q`. Keep the profits as given.
4.  **Adjust Profit Calculation:** Modify profit computation to include the new fee (`s` - `c` discounted) * quantity sold = profit + total fees. This links cost price, bulk discount, pack fee, and profit directly. Requires solving for `c`, `s`, `d` (or their combinations) using the profit equations and relationships between the two transactions.
5.  **Ensure Solvability:** Target variable `x` remains expenditure related to `c` and quantity bought with `x`. Clear dependencies: First transaction buys packs at `c` with `x`, sells all at `s` minus fees per pack. Revenue funds second purchase, but second purchase gets discount `d%` if quantity exceeds a threshold tied to the initial buy. Second sale includes same per-pack fee.

An athlete weighing 78.75 kg tests a net used by firefighters for rescuing people. The net sagged 100 cm when jumping from a height of 15 m. Assuming the net is elastic like a spring, calculate how much it will sag when a person weighing 45 kg jumps from a height of 29 m.

Given:

$m_{1} = 78.75$ kg;

Determine if this tension stays below the safety limit of 8 kN. Given: m₁=78.75kg, x₁=1m, h₁=15m, m₂=45kg, h₂=29m.","Step 1
#Elements Identified#:
Core Concept: Conservation of Mechanical Energy (Gravitational PE -> Elastic PE) with net modeled as a linear spring.
Variables: Mass (m), Sag Distance (x), Initial Jump Height (h), hidden spring constant (k).
Conditions: Net behavior is elastic (Hooke's law assumed).
Participants: Athlete (Test jump 1), Person (Scenario jump 2).
Actions: Use test jump data to find the spring constant (k), then apply energy conservation for the second jump to find new sag (x₂).
Theme: Predicting the deformation of a rescue net under different impact conditions.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Add Net Property Complexity:** Replace the simple linear spring model with a non-linear model where the stiffness increases with deformation. Specifically, the spring force F = a*x + b*x² (or equivalent spring constant k_eff = a + b*x). This requires determining two parameters (a, b) from the test data instead of one (k).
2.  **Introduce Energy Loss:** Include a non-conservative force by stipulating that 15% of the initial potential energy is dissipated (e.g., as heat/sound) during the impact with the net. The energy conservation equation must account for this loss.
3.  **Add Constraint & Calculation Goal:** Beyond calculating the sag (x₂), require determining if the maximum tension (based on F = a*x + b*x²) experienced by the net during the second jump falls below a critical safety threshold T_critical = 8 kN, defining the tension calculation as part of the solution. This adds a verification step dependent on the found sag.

#Elements Identified#:  
- Participants: Jay and Bob  
- Action: Drawing tadpoles (shapes composed of circles and an equilateral triangle)  
- Figure description:  
  - Four circles of identical radius (r)  
  - One equilateral triangle with horizontal side as the diameter of a circle (implying the horizontal side = 2r)  
- Core task: Compare the areas of the tadpoles to find the largest one  
- Ambiguity: The arrangement of the four circles is not explicitly described beyond one being linked to the triangle's base.  
- Theme: Geometry, specifically measuring areas of composite shapes.  
- Variables:  
  - Radius (r) of circles  
  - Side length of equilateral triangle (determined as 2r from one condition)  
- Potential for complexity increase:  
  - Add more circles (e.g., at vertices and midpoints).  
  - Introduce explicit relations between circle placements and the triangle.  
  - Define ""tadpole"" more rigorously to involve compound regions (e.g., intersection of circle and triangle).  
  - Include numerical constraints or formulae requiring calculations.  
  - Add asymmetry or additional conditions.  

Step 2  
#Plan#:  
1. **Expand the number of circles and describe arrangement**: Use six circles (instead of four) to increase spatial and calculational complexity—place circles at all three vertices and all three midpoints of the equilateral triangle. Maintain circle radius as r.  
2. **Specify side length** with a non-trivial relation to r: Set side length as (s = 4r) so circles at vertices and midpoints interact uniquely with the triangle, ensuring all elements are logically interconnected.  
3. **Define ""tadpole"" precisely**: To add analytical depth, define a tadpole as the intersection of each circle and the interior of the triangle, requiring students to compute this area per circle.  
4. **Introduce comparative reasoning**: Ask students to compute and compare tadpole areas for vertex-circle and midpoint-circle types, demanding expressions in terms of r and identification of the largest type.  
5. **Incorporate constraints**: Implicitly assume (as in Step 1) that the circles do not extend beyond relevant triangle boundaries, validated by the (s = 4r) choice (≥ 4r).  
6. **Ensure realism**: Keep the drafting class context with bullies Jay and Bob for theme consistency.

*   Condition: `f^n(x) = 0` must have exactly `2^n` distinct *real* roots for *every* natural number `n`.
*   Theme: Existence of a polynomial whose root structure under iteration grows exponentially and deterministically.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Add Domain/Range Constraint - Concretize & Increase Reasoning:** Require that `f(x)` is continuous over a specified closed interval (e.g., `[-5, 5]`) and that *all* distinct real roots of `f^n(x) = 0` for *every* `n` must lie within a specified bounded interval (e.g., `[-10, 10]`). This adds significant complexity by imposing global behavior and containment.
2.  **Introduce Parameter Optimization - Add Constraint & Reasoning:** Mandate that not only must such an `f(x)` (satisfying the root count condition and domain constraints) exist, but also that its leading coefficient `a` must be minimized (in absolute value). This transforms a pure existence question into an existence *plus* optimization problem, requiring reasoning about the polynomial's form.
3.  **Formulate as Direct Proof Request - Increase Rigor:** Reframe the question explicitly as an existence proof (`Prove or disprove`), strengthening the logical demand beyond a simple yes/no inquiry. Connect the containment constraint logically: the roots must lie in `[-10, 10]` *while* `f` is defined on `[-5, 5]`, introducing potential conflict needing resolution.
4.  **Ensure Coherence:** The new constraints (continuity, root containment, minimization) logically interact with the core problem. The boundedness constraint (`[-10,10]`) reinforces the exponential growth challenge (`2^n` distinct roots). Minimizing `|a|` depends intrinsically on the form of `f` satisfying the root conditions and containment.

1.  **Expand Trigonometric Range:** Replace the fixed multiples (2, 3, 4, 5) with a variable positive integer $n$ greater than a threshold (like 5 or 7), requiring rationality for all multiples up to $n$ *and* also specifically for $4n\alpha$ or $n^2\alpha$, creating an arbitrary length and a specific high multiple.
2.  **Introduce Sine Conditions:** Add analogous conditions for the sine function to the problem: require $\sin \alpha$ to be irrational but specific $\sin(k\alpha)$ terms (e.g., $\sin 2\alpha$, $\sin 3\alpha$) to be rational, forcing consideration of both functions simultaneously.
3.  **Modify Rationality Constraint (Concretize/Increase Reasoning):** Change the required rational values from only the simple cosines to include both cosines and sines of linear combinations (e.g., $\cos(2\alpha + 3\alpha$) and $\sin(5\alpha)$), demanding analysis of how arithmetic combinations affect rationality.

*   **Theme:** Differentiation of parametric equations defined by trigonometric functions.  

Step 2  
**#Plan#:**  
1.  **Concretize Parameter Domain:** Introduce an explicit restriction for `t` to avoid undefined points and add a minor complexity layer for domain consideration. Use `t ∈ (0, π/2)`.  
2.  **Increase Functional Complexity - `x`:** Modify `x` by composing it with the natural logarithm. New `x = ln(1 + (1 + cos² t)²)`. This fundamentally alters the derivative calculation, requiring the derivative of a `ln(u)` function and applying chain rule extensively to `(1 + cos² t)²`.  
3.  **Increase Functional Complexity - `y`:** Embed `y` within a sine function. New `y = sin( cos t / sin² t )`. This transforms `y_t` into the derivative of a composite function `sin(v)`, where `v = cos t / sin² t`, demanding multiple applications of the chain rule and quotient rule.  
4.  **Introduce an Implicit Constraint Condition:** Add a statement to compute the derivative specifically at `t` where a relation holds (`cos⁴ t = 1/2`). This forces solving for `t` within the domain and evaluating the derivative expression implicitly.  
**(Logic:** The new expressions are tightly coupled through `t`. Introducing `ln` and `sin` composites significantly increases the algebraic and chain rule application burden. Restricting the domain and demanding evaluation under a condition introduces concrete constraints and implicit solving without adding explicit new variables. The theme remains parametric differentiation with trig, but at a higher complexity level.)

#Elements Identified#:
- Letter-to-number mapping (a=1, b=2, ..., z=26)
- Concept: Product value (p) of a word
- Definition: ""Middle ring number"" = composite number *not* expressible as *any* word's p-value (words can be meaningless)
- Requirement: Find the smallest three-digit composite number meeting this.
- Core action: Verify non-representability of composites via word products.
- Key constraint: Words consist of lowercase letters.
- Theme: Combinatorial number theory related to multiplicative representations.

#Plan#:
1.  **Increase Complexity in Mapping:** Change the simple sequential integer mapping (a=1, b=2, etc.) to a mapping where each letter is assigned a distinct prime number (a=2, b=3, c=5, ..., z=101), maintaining sequential assignment.
2.  **Add Structural Constraint to Valid Words:** Mandate that only palindromic words (strings that read the same forwards and backwards) are considered for representing a product `p`. Words must have a minimum length of 4 letters.
3.  **Add Mathematical Constraint:** Specify that a candidate ""middle ring number"" must itself be palindromic as a number (reads the same forwards and backwards). Find the smallest such number meeting all conditions.
4.  **Refine Non-representability:** Maintain the core that the `p` value must not be representable as the product of primes corresponding to *any* palindromic word (>=4 letters), regardless of meaning.
5.  **Ensure Cohesion:** The prime mapping inherently links letter values to their multiplicative properties (primes). The palindrome constraints (word structure and number) add combinatorial restrictions and a thematic link. The minimum word length prevents trivial small products.

*   Actions/Processes: Defining sides via sequence, establishing a product identity for half-angle tangents, providing an expression for the inradius `r` using `d` and the difference of the same tangents.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Spacialization & Constraint Addition:** Add a geometric constraint involving the triangle's area `S` by requiring the triangle to be positioned with vertex `C` opposite side `c` at origin `(0,0)` and vertex `B` opposite `b` on the positive x-axis at `(m,0)` (`m>0`), where `m` is a free positive parameter. This forces side `c` and `b` along axes, adds spatial definition, implicit angle definitions via coordinates, and allows calculating the area.
2.  **Area Introduction & Elimination of `d`:** Require the area `S` to be expressed in the form `S = k * (tg α/2 - tg γ/2)²` (`k>0` is a constant) and to be used by the student. This introduces `S` and forces its derivation based on the given constraints. Directly providing `d` is removed; sides and `d` become derived quantities expressing in terms of `m`, the coordinates of `A(p,q)`, and the arithmetic sequence constraint.
3.  **Expression Expansion & Verification:** Modify the provided `r` expression. Instead of directly giving it as `r = 2d / (3(tg α/2 - tg γ/2))`, expand it by requiring the student to verify the equivalent expression `r = |4d / (3(tg α/2 - tg γ/2))| * (tg(α/2) - tg(γ/2)) / |tg(α/2) - tg(γ/2)|`. This makes the formula more complex by introducing the sign of the tangent difference explicitly and an apparent redundancy that simplifies back under the condition `a>c ⟹ α>γ ⟹ tg α/2 > tg γ/2`. *The core relationship and required output remain the expression verifying to `2d/(3(tg α/2 - tg γ/2))`.*
4.  **Concretization:** Specify the coordinates of vertex `A` as `(p, q)` with `p > 0` and `q > 0` to ensure the triangle lies in the first quadrant and side `a > b > c` holds. This adds concrete definitions and ensures positivity constraints.

In some English-speaking countries, temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit. An English schoolboy, observing a thermometer in a glass of cooling water, noted that it cooled down by $30^\circ \mathrm{F}$. He became curious about how much heat was released. In books, he found the following formula that allows the calculation of the answer to his question: $Q=4200 \cdot V \cdot \Delta T$, where $V$ is the volume of water in liters, and $\Delta T$ is the change in its temperature. However, the temperature change in this formula needs to be substituted in degrees Celsius. Degrees Fahrenheit are related to degrees Celsius by the following relationship: ${}^\circ F = {}^\circ C \cdot \frac{9}{5} + 32$. What result should he obtain if he had 2 liters of water?","**:  
An English schoolboy observed water in a cylindrical beaker cooling from 95°F to 65°F and sought the heat released.

**#Elements Identified#**:  
- **Variables**: ΔT (temperature change in °F given as 30°F drop), V (volume of water in liters, fixed at 2), Q (heat released, derived from formula).  
- **Conditions/Constraints**: Formula Q=4200·V·ΔT requires ΔT in °C, but initial data in °F; conversion °F = °C·(9/5) + 32; volume specified directly.  
- **Participants/Actions**: Schoolboy observes cooling, finds formula, applies it with given data.  
- **Process**: Convert temperature change from °F to °C, then compute Q.  
- **Theme**: Practical problem involving unit conversion for heat calculation in a real-world context.  

Step 2  
**#Plan#**:  
- Modify temperature input: Replace the direct temperature drop (30°F) with specific initial and final Fahrenheit temperatures (e.g., 95°F to 65°F), forcing the calculation of ΔT before conversion.  
- Expand volume specification: Instead of a fixed volume (2 liters), provide dimensions of a cylindrical container in imperial units (diameter and height in inches), requiring volume calculation with unit conversion to liters and implicating geometric reasoning.  
- Introduce additional output unit constraint: Require the result not in joules but in British Thermal Units (BTU), adding a post-calculation conversion with a given factor (1 BTU ≈ 1055 J).  
- Ensure interconnections: Calculated volume depends on dimensions, ΔT depends on temperature difference, and final Q depends on all, leading to BTU conversion for coherence with the ""English-speaking"" theme. Complexity increases through multi-step reasoning and real-world unit handling.

In the ""Triangle"" cinema, the seats are arranged in the shape of a triangle: the first row has one seat numbered 1, the second row has seats numbered 2 and 3, the third row has seats numbered 4, 5, 6, and so on. We define the best seat in the cinema hall as the one located at the center of the hall, i.e., at the midpoint of the height drawn from the vertex of the triangle corresponding to the seat numbered 1. Given a cinema hall where the best seat is numbered 265, how many seats are there in the cinema hall?","In the ""Triangle"" cinema, seats are arranged in a triangle: first row one seat, second row two, and so on. The best seat is at the centroid of the hall. If this seat is numbered 265, what is the total number of seats?","Step 1
#Elements Identified#:
- Triangular seat arrangement with rows: row 1 has 1 seat (1), row 2 has 2 seats (2,3), row 3 has 3 seats (4,5,6), etc.
- Total seats formula: \( T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) for \( n \) rows.
- Definition of ""best seat"": originally at midpoint of vertex height, requiring row \( m = \frac{n+1}{2} \) (so \( n \) odd) and seat number \( s = \frac{m^2 + 1}{2} \).
- Problem input/output: given best seat number (265), find total seats \( T_n \).

Step 2
#Plan#:
- Change best seat definition to be at the centroid (medians' intersection) instead of height midpoint, altering the row position and constraints.
- Modify row calculation: centroid requires row \( k = 1 + \frac{2(n-1)}{3} \) for \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \), and the seat number formula remains sames as \( s = \frac{k^2 + 1}{2} \).
- Introduce an additional constraint by no longer specifying the seat numbering in rows explicitly, requiring derivation from the triangular pattern.
- Ensure dependencies: the centroid formula increases complexity through fractional row indexing and modular conditions.

Step 3

In the ""Triangle"" cinema, seats are arranged in a triangle: the first row has one seat, the second has two, and so forth. The best seat is defined as the one at the centroid of the hall. Given this seat is numbered 265, determine the total number of seats.

Solve the inequality \(\frac{\sqrt{x^{2}+x}-\sqrt{4-2 x}}{2 x+5-2 \sqrt{x^{2}+5 x+6}} \leq 0\). 

Consider the domain of validity:

- \(x(x+1) \geq 0\)
- \(4-2 x \geq 0\)
- \(x^{2}+5 x+6 \geq 0\)

Which gives \(x \in (-\infty, -3] \cup [-2, -1] \cup [0, 2]\).

The given inequality is equivalent to:

\[
\frac{(x+4)(x-1)}{(x+3)-2 \sqrt{(x+3)(x+2)}+x+2} \leq 0.
\]

For \(x \geq -2\):

\[
\frac{(x+4)(x-1)}{(\sqrt{x+3}-\sqrt{x+2})^{2}} \leq 0,
