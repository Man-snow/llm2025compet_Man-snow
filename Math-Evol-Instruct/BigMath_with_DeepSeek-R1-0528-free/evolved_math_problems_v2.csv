A four-digit number, when a 7 is added in front of it, becomes a five-digit number. When a 7 is added to its end, it also becomes a five-digit number. The difference between these two five-digit numbers is 53208. What is the original four-digit number? $\qquad$ .","Step 1
#Elements Identified#:
*   Original four-digit number (let's call it `X`)
*   Fixed digit ""7"" added to the front (prefixing) forming number `70000 + X`
*   Fixed digit ""7"" added to the end (suffizing) forming number `10X + 7`
*   Fixed difference `53208` between the two five-digit numbers
*   Basic algebraic equation: `(70000 + X) - (10X + 7) = 53208` or vice versa, depending on magnitude
*   Theme: Modular arithmetic/base-10 representation difference operations

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Variable Digits:** Replace the fixed digit ""7"" with distinct variable digits for prefixing (`k`) and suffixing (`m`). This introduces unknowns requiring solution criteria.
2.  **Complex Difference:** Replace the fixed difference `53208` with an expression involving a new parameter `N` (`9000*N - 90`). This forces solvers to determine `N` and adds an algebraic layer.
3.  **Multiple Constraints:** Add distinct dependent constraints:
    *   Constraint 1: `k > m` (relationship ensures correct magnitude order).
    *   Constraint 2: `m` is a prime number (adds primality condition).
    *   Constraint 3: The digit sum of the original number `X` must be congruent to `k modulo 3` (adds digit sum analysis modulo relationship).
4.  **Logically Interconnect:** Ensure all new elements affect the solution. The equation involves `k`, `m`, `N`, and `X`. Constraints impose conditions on `k`, `m`, and `X`, demanding they be solved simultaneously/satisfied by the final `X`. The theme remains consistent but requires substantially more reasoning.

Step 3
#Rewritten Instruction#:
Let the original number be a four-digit integer, `X`. Adding a digit `k` to its front yields a five-digit number `P`. Adding a digit `m` to its end yields another five-digit number `S`. The difference `|P - S| = 9000*N - 90` for a positive integer `N`. Find `X` given: `k > m`, `m` is prime, and the digit sum of `X` ≡ `k mod 3`.

Step 4
#Finally Rewritten Instruction#:
Let the original number be a four-digit integer, `X`. Adding digit `k` to its front forms a five-digit number `P`. Adding digit `m` to its end forms another five-digit number `S`. The difference `|P - S| = 9000*N - 90` for a positive integer `N`. Determine `X` given: `k > m`, `m` is prime, and the digit sum of `X` ≡ `k mod 3`.",0.0

A student-entrepreneur bought several packs of masks from a pharmacy and sold them to classmates at a higher price, making a profit of 1000 rubles. With all the money earned, he bought more masks from the pharmacy (at the same price as the first purchase) and sold them to classmates (at the same price as the first sale). This time, the profit was 1500 rubles. How much money did he spend on the first purchase?","Step 1  
**#Elements Identified#:**  
- **Participants:** Student-entrepreneur, pharmacy (supplier), classmates (customers).  
- **Key Variables:**   
  - Initial and subsequent purchase amounts (money spent/sold).  
  - Profit amounts (1000 rubles, 1500 rubles).  
  - Fixed purchase price per mask (pharmacy).  
  - Fixed sale price per mask (classmates).  
  - Reinvestment mechanism (entire proceeds from sale used for next purchase).  
- **Conditions:**  
  - Prices (buy/sell) remain constant in each phase.  
  - Profit calculation (sale revenue minus purchase cost).  
- **Theme:** Iterative reinvestment with profit generation.  

Step 2  
**#Plan#:**  
1. **Introduce variable pricing:** Replace fixed prices with *bulk discounts*. Pharmacy offers lower per-mask prices for larger purchases, while classmates demand lower prices if buying larger quantities.  
2. **Add discount thresholds:** Specify explicit discount tiers for *both* buying and selling. For example:  
   - Pharmacy: 10 rubles/mask if purchasing ≤150 masks, 8 rubles/mask if >150.  
   - Classmates: 15 rubles/mask if purchasing ≤100 masks, 12 rubles/mask if >100.  
3. **Amplify iterative cycle:** Require *three* full cycles (initial + two reinvestments) with profit targets (1000 rubles, 1500 rubles, and **2100 rubles**).  
4. **Enforce reinvestment constraint:** All earnings from each cycle must fund the next purchase, including surplus from discounts.  
5. **Maintain consistency:** Ensure discount thresholds influence profit calculations non-linearly, demanding optimization.  

Step 3  
**#Rewritten Instruction#:**  
A student-entrepreneur bought masks from a pharmacy. The pharmacy's price: 10 rubles/mask for ≤150 masks or 8 rubles/mask for >150 masks. He sold them to classmates: 15 rubles/mask for ≤100 masks or 12 rubles/mask for >100 masks. His first profit was 1000 rubles. Using all earnings, he repeated the process twice more, making profits of 1500 rubles and 2100 rubles respectively. How much did he spend on the initial purchase?

Bullies Jay and Bob drew tadpoles during drafting class (four circles in the picture, all with the same radius, the triangle is equilateral, and the horizontal side of this triangle is the diameter of the circle). Which tadpole has the largest area?","Step 1
#Elements Identified#:
*   **Participants/Actions:** Bullies drawing tadpoles, composed of circles.
*   **Objects:** Tadpoles (four circles each).
*   **Geometry:** Four circles per tadpole, all circles same *initial* radius. An equilateral triangle, its horizontal side is the diameter of one circle. One circle centered at a vertex of the triangle? *Implied: Three circles at triangle vertices, one ""central"" circle.*
*   **Core Question:** Compare the areas of the shaded tadpole figures.
*   **Key Variables:** Circle radius (initially the same for all circles), triangle being equilateral, fixed position relative to circles.
*   **Constraints:** Specific geometric relationships (side = diameter, equilateral triangle).
*   **Theme:** Comparing areas of composite shapes built from circles under geometric constraints.

Step 2
#Plan#:
1.  **Vary Tadpole Geometry:** Modify the circles within the composite figure. Make only the three outer circles (at the ""vertices"") have the same radius `r`. The inner ""central"" circle will have a *different* radius `s = k*r` (`k` a variable ratio to be determined later).
2.  **Reduce Symmetry:** Remove the equilateral triangle constraint. Instead, the triangle connecting the centers of the three outer circles will be a **scalene triangle**. Specify distinct side lengths (e.g., `a`, `b = 1.5a`, `c = 2a`), with the horizontal side `c` still being the diameter of its circle (so `c = 2r`).
3.  **Add Compound Condition & Calculation:** Introduce a specific constraint linking areas: the *total area of ink used for the circles* (sum of the areas of all four circles per tadpole) must be constant `A` for all tadpoles drawn. This forces a relationship between `r` and `s` for each tadpole. Require explicit calculation of fractions: the tadpole figure represents the area *unique* to that tadpole -- the area common to *at least one* circle but *excluding* the area within the central circle that overlaps *all three* outer circles.
4.  **Increase Reasoning Depth:** Combine the variable geometry, complex area calculations (overlaps in a scalene setup), derived relationship from ink constraint, and precise shaded area definition. Requires solving for tadpole area in terms of `A`, considering the distinct overlaps influenced by the scalene triangle and different radii.

Step 3
#Rewritten Instruction#:
Bullies Jay and Bob drew scalene-triangular tadpoles where three outer circles (radius `r`) have centers defining a scalene triangle with sides `a`, `b = 1.5a`, and horizontal side `c = 2a = 2r`. Each tadpole includes a central circle of radius `s = k*r` intersecting the outer circles. The total area of ink for all four circles per tadpole is fixed at `A`. Find `k` ensuring positive overlap. The tadpole area is defined as the unique area covered by at least one circle, excluding the central region overlapping all three outer circles. Which tadpole (Jay's or Bob's) has a larger tadpole area if Jay's horizontal side `c_J = c` and Bob's `c_B = 1.2c`?

#Finally Rewritten Instruction#:
Bullies Jay and Bob drew scalene-triangular tadpoles: three outer circles (radius `r`) form a scalene triangle with sides `a`, `b=1.5a`, horizontal diameter `c=2a=2r`. A central circle of radius `s=k*r` intersects them. Total ink area of all four circles is fixed at `A` per tadpole, requiring a unique `k>0` ensuring central overlap. The tadpole area excludes the central region overlapping all three outer circles. For Jay (`c_J=c`) and Bob (`c_B=1.2c`), whose tadpole area is larger?",0.0

How much money is Ivanov entitled to receive? Provide the answer in million rubles.","Step 1
#Elements Identified#:
- Participants: Ivanov, Petrov, Sidorov
- Contributions: Ivanov (70 identical cars), Petrov (40 identical cars), Sidorov (44 million rubles)
- Condition: Ivanov and Petrov share money among themselves to equalize contributions
- Theme: Equity adjustment in a business partnership with mixed car and cash contributions
- Unknown: Money Ivanov receives (in million rubles)
- Key Concepts: Uniform car cost, money sharing mechanism, fixed cash contribution, equal net contribution
